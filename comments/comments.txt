[Just Keep Choppin'](https://imgur.com/gallery/PX9avDU)GO DAWGS!!!
**FUN FACT:** The G on Georgia''s helmets stands for “Georgia,” the name of the state in which the school is located. The numbers on Alabama''s helmets represent the jersey number worn by each player.
LETS GO DAWGS
This will be fun...
First post! Edit: Damn, fifth post. 
I know it **HURTS** but one last time...Can you even see what you're fighting for?Blood lust in a holy warListen up, hear the patriot shout:Times are changingIn the end, the choice was clearTake a shot in the face of fearFist up in the firing lineTimes are changingDo you believe that you can walk on water?**DO YOU BELIEVE THAT YOU CAN WIN THIS FIGHT TONIGHT?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!**
\#teammeteor
**WHAT 2 WATCH 4:** Expect a compelling and entertaining Crimson Tide performance led by Gene Hackman and Denzel Washington.
WHO'S THAT COMING DOWN THE TRACK
Guess I could play ALttP to pass the time tonight. Woo?
I love the fact that if Alabama loses this game then the season will have been a massive failure.
Thanks harvard
A huge machine that's going to kill everyone 
Some legends are told.
BTW, it is Mercedes-Benz STADIUM, not the Superdome.
Roll Tide.Puke.
Roll Dawgs! 
Thanks, Harvard
Thanks, Harvard. 
ROLL TIDE!!!!!!!!
S I CEM
Thanks Harvard!
I don't know who will win tonight but I know who is losing: WatchESPN users.
I AM READY TO WITNESS THE BEST SURRENDER COBRAS ALLLL YEAR BABY. LETS GO CLOSE GAME!!
Fun Fact: Auburn has lost their last 2 games in Atlanta and they open next season in the Chick-fil-a Kickoff Game... in Atlanta. 
Still scarred from last weekend; hope it's a competitive game. Going to lose my mind without CFB.
Rooting for the Dwags in solidarity with my Georgia kinfolk.
Alabama is wearing their away uniforms, Georgia is fucked
Since r/cfb is boycotting the game this should be a pretty quiet thread. 
Crack open my last Guinness and get ready for the last football of the season
Wow quarterly threads huh? 
I won''t lie, at the end of that movie, I expect the crew to start chanting S-E-C! S-E-C! When the nuclear threat is eliminated 
WHAT WILL THERE BE MORE OFFUCF NATIONAL CHAMP COMMENTS ORYARDS IN THE FIRST QUARTER TAKE YOUR BETS! WINNER GETS SOMETHING I GUESS  IDK IM NEW AT THIS 
Fuck Auburn
Muchas gracias Harvard
Big is true
Roll fucking Tide. 
Dilly Mc freakin Dilly
Tonight is here.  I can't BELIEVE this is happening and against Alabama at Mercedes-Benz.  GO DAWGS!!! #H8 H8 H8 H8 H8 H8 H8 H8 H8 H8 H8 H8 
Tonight, I firmly believe the reign of Saban ends, Kirby Smart is the student who will conquer the teacher and it will be a war.
I'd like to apologise in advance for all of the insufferable SEC fans that will be in this thread, myself included.
I am not nervous, you are nervous. 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH MY HANDS
I missed the entire season. Why are you guys boycotting the game?
thanks harvard
Harvard you have truly gone above and beyond the call of duty tonight. Thanks Harvard. 
IM GONNA PUKE 
It''s honestly not nearly as good as Centuries.
Let's not Dawg this
Bama in six 
Weren''t they wearing those at Auburn this season?
My prediction is Bama: 27  UGA: 17  But I really hope Alabama wins by the score of 28-3
If only this game was in the Georgia Dome 
That wasn''t a Championship game 
thanks StupidRetard69420
Search videos of McKinley Wright 
Butterflies are in full effect
Don''t let Georgia and Alabama playing in an all SEC national championship game distract you from the fact that Michigan does in fact still suck.
WE'RE* GOING TO PUKE.  I ate at like 11am and haven't ate since besides chips and dip.  I'm going to fucking explode.
I haven't even watched one full college game this season but lets go Georgia 
GETTING INTO THIS GAME WAS AN ABSOLUTE SHIT SHOW. 
One last hoorah until August. ROLL DAMN TIDE. 
UCF beat Memphis 
Go Dawgs?
Let''s pray we don''t need 5 yards tonight :(
Go Georgia! 
i'm just here for the shit postsRTR
MY BODY IS READY
Speed Runnin! Young Gunnin! Hard Defendin! Dynasty Endin! Damn Good Dawgs! Wooooo!
Flying sober for this game cause I caught a wicked head cold, GO DAWGS, MOTHAFUCKAS! DRINK IN MY STEAD! MAY THE FURIES OF THE FOOTBALL GODS SHOW FAVOR FOR THE DAWGS!
I have condores in my stomach..  Butterflies aren't enough.
[What do we say?](https://youtu.be/rjRxdrg9BtU)
Not going to lie, I didn''t understand the title of that movie until I started watching college football
Thanks Choppy Bro
Is it a 50/50 crowd?
We don't deserve to be here but we'll win 
Still pulling for you guys Georgia
Hope it's a good game! I guess go Dawgs?!?
Man it''s getting pretty annoying hear all the guys in the constantly talk about Alabama and only Alabama 
I got u fam.  Whiskey and Coke
ROLL DAWGS!
It''s the national championship. We go big.
Roll Tide *puke*
Woooooooooo
Lol this Joe Tess segment is so weird
I'm not happy about any of this.  I'm just here to enjoy the last sliver of good football we have until the off season :(
mmm dat's good
[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYa8gy3vOvE) is how I feel right now.
Let's go Dawgs!
Hey UGA, no matter who wins, we both agree that Auburn sucks. 
You have to wonder if the commentators got a special memo from ESPN to not acknowledge UCF''s existence during the game.
Yes
Hard to tell because everyone is still in the security line. Skewing UGA right now for sure. 
I'll take UCF national champs comments for $200 Alex. (I don't know how this works either)
Now you know whats its like to be a Florida fan in Atlanta. Enjoy it.
I'm not ready for the offseason yet
I like this guy
I''m praying for shenanigans that rival B1G CCG TurfGate
And Tennessee too 
I don''t know who I want to win. I''m in awe of Bama''s dynasty. We''re witnessing history, and I''m trying to appreciate it as much as I can. At the same time, UGA can make history and finally ascend to the top of the sport. 
How many "UGA doesnt have a bandwagon" comments will I see today?Those are always great for a chuckle or 10
Who are the Auburn fans in here pulling for?
Since 94 except for illness or intl travel never missed a game. I am so content and happy for me and the dawg nation. In Miami for work and found a dive bar in Delray Beach to do this. I hope I lose my voice, dignity and few hundred bucks in bar tap. Let''s keep the main thing the main thing and chop some wood. Who''s with me?
Oh boy
Pizza is on the way the puppy just took his nap let''s do this boys. 
It seemed like the dude on the field in the suit is coked up lol
LET'S GOOOOOO DAWGS! SIC'EM WOOF WOOF WOOF WOOF WOOF WOOF WOOF WOOF WOOF WOOF WOOF WOOF WOOF WOOF WOOF WOOF WOOF WOOF WOOF WOOF WOOF WOOF WOOF WOOF 
Mind blown 
Here we go, boys and girls. Here''s hoping for a tie, or a meteor (with no casualties of course).At least I''m not an Auburn fan...
I feel that. The commentators suck and we dont deserve all the dick suckin'' they give us
Well said! and to add, great season for us both!
WHO SHOULD I ROOT FOR TONIGHT? THERE IS A RIGHT ANSWER
>I don't know who will win tonight but I know who is losing: ~~WatchESPN users.~~ America. 
You could''ve lined up 100 people and I would''ve never guessed who Landon Collins was. Football helmets conceal everything appearance wise 
GO DAWGS!
Dilly Dilly
Thank You, Go Dawgs!
Are Georgia fans nervous that Bama is going to stack the box and force Fromm to sling it? I'm not sure Bama has a swiss cheese defense against the run. Then again, your backs are ridiculous.  
I think I have to agree with you and it kills me to say it
First quarter drinking thread! How are y'all getting boozed up?
I'm gonna be honest, as a neutral fan it's hard to even get excited to see Bama play in another championship game, especially when they shouldn't have even made playoffs in the first place 
Man, it seems like yesterday we were watching Alabama roll Florida State in this same stadium.Season went by too quick
the sweet release of death
Hot take: You''re going to be hearing the name “Jake Fromm” for a loooong time. 
Yes! Fuck Georgia 
Just watched the crazy Georgia fan video Gooooo daaaaaawwwwwwwgs
Can I join as a drunk obnoxious Georgia fan
Pregame Field Pass on ESPN 2 is like a red carpet show
I''m nervous for you, Georgia. Good luck!
Meteor? Implosion?  idk.  Death?
Glory, glory to ole'' Georgia.Heroes have graced the field before you. Men with hearts, bodies and minds for which the entire Bulldog Nation can be justifiably proud. The tradition of unbridled excellence demonstrated by these individuals and many others spans more than a full century. And now a new breed of Bulldawg stands ready to take the field of Battle. To assume the reigns of their Georgia forebearers. To continue that tradition. Understanding that there is no tradition more worthy of envy. No institution worthy of such loyalty as The University of Georgia.As we prepare for a meeting in the national championship game let all the Bulldawg faithful rally behind the men who now wear the red and black with two words. Two simple words that express the sentiments of the entire Bulldawg Nation…GO DAWGS
Anyone know-- Are they planning on setting up "home town calls" on WatchESPN like they did for the first round? 
That is a fun fact!
We already got Leakgate cause the roof is leaking
Thank you, Irish
The state of Georgia will be in complete disarray if Georgia losses in similar fashion to the Falcons in the super bowl... 
Idk. I mean they ruined Clemson in the rematch. They seem to have at least have an argument of making it. 
I'm fine with it.
Auburn fans rooting for Bane to show up
Let's go UGA!
Do you believe that you can win this fight tonight?
Purring?
Every team has tried this, and it only worked once. It could for them though 
May we shitpost proudly on this night
What was the tweet Kirby had on his card? I saw it right as him and Saban were talking. Can someone with DVR help me out?
FIRE BUTCH JONES
Sweet! 
WHOEVER WINS
Oh shit guys, we get to watch the Black Panther preview. That's the real reason I'm here.
Really because ESPN has been pushing their Georgia agenda ALL DAY... 
Black panther looks good...
It''s all their fault 
the NBA on ESPN commercial that looks like a video game with Kyrie with a very low score on Astrophysics is absolutely fucking amazing.  That is fucking top.
If we get a better deep game next year he could be first round pick. Apparently scouts already see him with that potential   
one can only hope, dawg bro
https://i.imgur.com/RTjE8Su.jpg
Amen
It's MARVEL so... yah.
Not wrong.  Lots of "Just...god damn it" from Auburn friends.
Well, that was hurtful.
True and Wim (sp?) is a mismatch on most DBs
Link?
No where close. 
Go Dawgs! Hopefully at least ONE Beamer can get a title ring now.
F
this camera work on the field of the players warming up is making be dizzy. Fuck off ESPN.
I love it 
If you don't count NFL playoff football 
There's still the NFL?
\#PutInTua
Black Panther looks dope as fuck
That's more of a hindsight thing to me, kinda like UCF beating Auburn and people saying they should've made playoffs when the they didn't even play any huge competition in the regular season. Idk that's just me though 
The year is 2018SEC finally destroyed all resistance and met in Natty> 'Ladies and Gentlemen, I am your front reporter bakonydraco and we are with our chief analyst meatfrappe here today to cast this epic final showdown between Alabama Crimsontide and Gerogia Hate here in Merced-----WAIT WHAT WAS THAT?!!!!'The entrance suddenly blast open with smoke> 'IT....

UPVOTE THE THREAD TO #1 ON ALL
THE THEME MUSIC IS TOO DAMN LOUD
My favorite part of today might be all that really shitty, lazy attempts at saying that the outcome of this will either work in favor or against a "Atlanta Sports Moment"Hmmm. [Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/knMmyiP.jpg)UGA = Atlanta? That's a no for me dog.
YO that bball commercial was cool!!! 
Hey guys, I just woke up from a 6 week coma. I thought Georgia was playing Auburn in the SEC Championship, what gives?
Wow, they played like 10 seconds of DO YOU BELIEVE YOU CAN WIn this fIGHT TONIGHTThat's easily like 8 seconds more of that song than I've ever heard before.
So far so good...
*hello darkness my old friend*
Jalen Hurts needs to ask Todd Gurley for his hair-dresser on the dreads.
My friend told me that whiskey is great for colds lol
My honest hope before the season was to win a very down SEC east. I am so happy to be watching my Dawgs play on Jan. 8th. GO DAWGS!!!! 
Tell me someone talked shot and gave us something to feed on!
Wims definitely had a size advantage. I like Mecole Hardman in the slot. 
Dilly Dilly!  Go Dawgs!
ESPN stream already crapping out and the game hasn't even started... fml
I like to drive in my truck...
UCF should cash in their briefcase tonight!
Upvoting everyone in this thread because this is the last college football game of the year and I'm really going to miss these threads. Go Dawgs!
It seems like just yesterday I was eagerly watching South Florida @ San Jose State in week 0 and it's already almost over. I hope we end the year on a fun note
Do what I do: Watch Hockey, cheer for the leafs and only tune in every few minutes.
Remind me, how much did they pay to suck again? 
Dilly Dilly!
Good luck tonight, Georgiabros!Love,ND Nation
Honestly I'm hoping just for a close game validating our game against the Bulldogs that being said go dogs and keep it cleanEdit: thanks for the grammar correction kind stranger 
Rooting for the dawgs and they drink my drink? Let's get some revenge for 2012 boys!
It''s time Dawgs and Tide fans. Here is to a great, multiple cardiac arrest, aging, and injury free game. My heart is racing already..ROLL TIDE!
I doubt there are any Auburn fans willingly in this thread 
Well Auburn lost to UCF and that's not a quality loss, so they rescheduled the game
Anybody know what referees we're getting tonight?
Thanks Harvard.
It''s the daily double. Get it correct and your reward will be doubled. (400$)
Time for Beamer Ball to finally get a ring
I don't know, I'd find it quite amusing. 
Ugh. I don't have cable and it's raining in socal so I'm not feeling like going out. Stupid ESPN!!!! Disney owns both ESPN and ABC. Just air it on both networks
DILLY DILLY! 
"This is a four quarter football game"Since when?!
Makes sense, UCF didn't even have a quality loss itself
Plus, I'm a Dolphins fan, so fuck Saban, even if I have no real animosity for Bama.
Fair enough. If anything though Bama has taken advantage of their luck in this and have now made it (although it was only one game.... there needs to be more playoff games.) 
It's cool I'm nervous too. Eating this cheese ball like I haven't eaten in weeks. 
Come on in and enjoy the game Buckeye.
I thought I heard B1G but I could be wrong. 
Got my pizza in one hand, beer in the other, and I''m ready for my annual letdown when once again Alabama crushes everyone''s hopes and dreams.Go Dawgs!
He's got good hands as well. Good luck! Hope you pull it off.
Good Luck Georgia fans. The good news is, no matter who wins, Auburn loses
Win or lose, I'm just glad I never have to hear that damn "Win this fight tonight" song ever again.
AUBURN SUCKS
Can you repeat that one more time?
Coke is from Georgia so hell yeah!
Yeah with the local radio broadcast alone the servers cannot handle it. Maybe I will r/AskReddit why they can''t use more servers like HBOGo does for Game of Thrones. 
is there a prediction thread. I have no idea what to expect
YouTube TV and SlingTV have free trials 
Thanks Notre Dame bros. See y'all next year. 
More like, let''s not “Georgia sports” this
OH MY GAWD, THAT'S UCF'S MUSIC!
I don't care for Aurburn
But the NFL doesn''t mean more ;~;
LET'S GO DAWGS, ROQUAN I'VE FINALLY ACCEPTED YOU WENT WHERE YOU WERE MEANT TO SO PLEASE SKULLFUCK THE TIDE FANBASES HOPES AND DREAMS TONIGHT.
/r/cfbstreams
>a Tech fan in Atlanta. 
They did it with the Wild Card game, idk why they don't do it more often
Dilly Dilly
The only game thread you can make bullshit comments and get upvoted
One final score! OSU fans HATE it
DO YOU BELIEVE YOU CAN WALK ON WADA
r/cfbstreams
r/cfbstreams is here for you 
Dilly Dilly!
I saw my first Alabama Bandwagon flair.
The chances are slim to none but I would love Roquan on the Dolphins. 
Im aware
Best of luck Georgia dawgs! 
"Welcome to the 2nd place game thread." ~ UCF Fan, probably 
Georgia, please save us
I'M NOT READY FOR THE OFFSEASON YOU GUYS HOLD ME
One of these two teams will win
Hearing of fighting outside. Not the normal 1 idiot vs 1 idiot. But several fights braking out. Also someone tweeted that the roof is leaking?
Walk on water by 30 seconds to mars so you never get conned into listening to it.
Shouldn't this thread be called 'CFP co-NCG'?
\#RollTide
It took me way too long to find a game thread. I earned this beer.
GO DAWGS
that *being* said broski
An SEC team will win tonight
[deleted]
We all like to drive in our trucks this glorious day
Flip a coin like Booger(?)
Its more that I've been hopped up on dayquil and nyquil for the last 3 days. I don't want to kill my liver... yet.
Godammit
Congrats everyone, we saved a *shit ton* of money by not attending this game.
*SOBS UNCONTROLLABLY*
So what's the difference between watching on ESPN or ESPN2?
I''m actually excited to see how well Bama defense holds up to Georgia''s running game 
The roof is leaking. 
when is kick off
DILLY DILLY!
A beautiful friendship was forged that night. Looking forward to the next matchup. But before that, UGA needs to take what''s theirs tonight!
Unless your team didn't make the playoffs in which case you've never liked the pros anyway. 
It's a unicorn!
THIS MAN HAS BEEN POSTING TO REDDIT WHILE IN A COMA. EXPLAIN THAT ATHIESTS!!
I got you. Cervezas in Perú
That's the reason I'm here
Well ones thing for sure.  No matter who wins every fan in the south is going to be unbearable and chanting SEC!  SEC!  SEC!PS.  Go Georgia. 
Elephants and dogs are both pretty dope, but I'd be a lot less pissed if a dog shit in my house so go dawgs.
Is there a poll on who /r/cfb Thinks is gonna win? 
Sometimes it feels good to just be a fan of CFB and not either of these teams. Don't get me wrong, I would love Michigan to be in this spot but it's also fun not having any of the heartbreak or uneasy feeling and just to be able to relax and watch a Natty. I have no favorite I would love to see Saban win one and I would love to see Kirby win one so may the best man win.
THE /r/ CFB NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP DRINKING GAME:Take 1 drink IF:-ESPN mentions Saban being 11-0 vs his former assistants -A UCF fan bitches in the game thread-ESPN mentions from playing in the LLWS-ESPN talks about the game being won in the trenches -Every time they mention Auburn''s strategy in the Iron Bowl and see if Georgia tries to utilize a similar strategy-They mention Alabama and Georgia being built the same wayTake 2 drinks IF: -There is an SEC commercial-Every time they talk about how many years Kirby and Saban were together-The ESPN stream crashes -You hear the phrase SEC speedFinish your drink IF:-ESPN mentions UCF claiming the title-Alabama wins the championship 
I mean Saban has a damn good record in Atlanta...
I dislike UF and Georgia dislikes UF so I want Georgia to win based only on this. Go dawgs.
When football ends, I look forward to pitchers and catchers reporting. 
me last season: yeah i mean i go to uga, go dawgs, i saw nick chubb waiting for the bus outside stegman onceme this season: SHE TRULY IS THE FAIREST OF THE SOUTHLAND..WHO'S THAT COMING DOWN THE TRACK? HERSCHEL WALKER LITERALLY RAISED ME
How's the leaky roof?
8:17 ET
Have they said how long Kendrick is gonna be out there? Like I like him but I hate long halftimes
Is Alabama the Patriots of college football? Or are the Patriots the Alabama of the NFL?
I'd guess like 30 minutes
Holy shit bois it's really about to go down! GO DAWGS!!!
So we will finally settle who is the best team ^that ^lost ^to ^Auburn.
Thank you
Alabama, I hope you guys have an injury free game with a performance you can be proud of... but fall just short of winning.
Hello Georgia bros.
take it easy some of us have jobs dude
If you think about it dogs are just tiny bears. I think I can make this work, Georgia.
Can''t be any longer than 15 min tops
/u/SpongeSmith gonna end up with dead bodies on his hands.
I've been excited to watch this all day. Let's go Dawgs!
Nah we already played there in 2017. Maybe the rainy conditions will mess things up though
His hands are questionable, but he runs a legit 4.3. Thanks I'm about to puke
Is it really a *National Championship* Halftime Performance if UCF isn''t playing in the game?
JUST LET THE BANDS PLAY AT HALF
If bama loses do they find a new quarterback?
Appreciate you doing the leg work, SEC bro
Drink it all if they mention Sam Darnold. 
Will any channel be showing Kendrick? 
*i want to live tho*
So.. which of the 183652 options are you all going to watch this game with? I think I''m gonna go with the coaching room. 
Since it's a weekday I'll be playing with water.I'm going to get **so** hydrated!
Bama being a playoff caliber team does not equate to them deserving to be in the playoffs. They lost the one game that mattered more than any other this year. Bama is a playoff caliber team every year, but this year they snuck in. That said, Bama 28-21.
Is it true that Kendrick isn't even performing in the stadium?
I''m sure the bands will enjoy a performance by Lamar 
We do deserve. 
Tiny House Hunters is definitely a comedy horror movie
Still looks real empty in the stadium. Are there issues at the gates?
Yes he is across the street
Can somebody give me some spicey laughing .gif's? I may need some in case Alabama loses.
My penis told me that whiskey is bad for sex but good for air guitar solos
Hey Rudy
Auburn sucks
I mean, I get why they'd put the CFP logo at midfield and all, but shouldn't they have at least put SEC logos on the 25's?
Damn, bruh. I made sure to grab a side of pizza with my entree of whiskey. Gotta even it out. 
B1G #1 ^^^in ^^^financial ^^^planning
I absolutely love it's between these two schools! Good luck tonight!
People waiting until last min to go in so they can tailgate 
guys, im already drunk, what do i do?
I Think you have other problems if there is an elephant in your house 
https://i.imgur.com/RTjE8Su.jpg
Not there but my friend said it took forever to get through security
Bands are playing at half 
Let's get weird.
Abso-fucking-lutely. God I''m nervous. 
"The ESPN stream crashes"Dude, you could be on the hook for a lot of untimely deaths tonight. 
Will we finally see Saban''s final form?
Hey guys, I hear there's going to be a football game during the Kendrick Lamar concert.
Im not crying! Youre crying!
...and families
They already have him.
HOLY SHIT HOLY SHIT HOLY SHIT HOLY SHIT AHHHHHH
Get more drunk
Get drunker
Nice
Drink some more
We did our part and beat Bama. Not our fault OSU got their shit pushed in by Iowa.
They could have lined up 1000000 people and i would have never guessed who he was
Security is high and a gate was closed for a bit cause POTUS
I'm prepared to be disappointed.
The committee picks the four best teams. There were three great teams this year, then there was no other option but Bama
Theres a stage outside but at least it wont hold up the 2nd half 
Alright...I've got my bleach ready. Let's watch this thing
When Saban retires it''ll be a huge wake up call for a lot of people, unless they manage to hire a top-tier replacement.I''d also be willing to bet Saban will ensure he leaves the program is great shape for his successor, similar to Stoops leaving OU.
Like I would let you use my dank memes
Apparently security lines aren't moving. 
The star power on the sidelines right now is ridiculous 
The president is there man. Security going to be tight as a virgins asshole. 
Hmmm explain?
https://media.giphy.com/media/hJg5mEVkUCJhu/giphy.gifI got you.
If you don''t have to drive then you should drink more
"Wow, it's really small."Those fucking people.
Yep he's at Centennial Park 
Drink more. If you black out and Alabama wins, then no harm done. If you black out and y''all win, you get to experience it twice!
SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT
Gonna watch normal ESPN tonight and the coaching room sometime later this week
For whatever reason, I just can't stop thinking Alabama wins this in 2011-like fashion.Alabama 17, Georgia 3.
They are evolutionalarily somewhat related 
not wrong.  I'm with u bro
I work with an UGA grad and he was a wreck today. Looked like hell. While I'd love to see State in the title game, I didn't envy him today. I'd be the same way 
Obligatory “I hate everything”
Damn it you got me on that one. Have the upvote.
hehe, Chubby time
Bruh 
I'm already half a gallon deep 
We were hoping you guys would come by for drinks and snacks.
Upping the ante. I like it

Alright Georgia I don't like you and you don't like me but nothing will ever surpass my hate for these arrogant Crimson fuckers so kick their ass.
Today I got into Georgia's graduate school. Go Dawgs!
The farther we get away from the selection, the more I come around to that fact. Hope you have a good night, bittersweet flair internet friend!

Stop drinking because this game is important 
Jesus Christ that is lame AF.
POTUS is there, security is probably a nightmare. 
I love bulldogs so much
Just received word that /r/CFB is projected to overtake the Dead Sea for the saltiest place on Earth in the situation that Alabama wins this game...
At least that is better than the Alabama - LSU title game results...
WOOOOO
Not a good boy.
Probably UGA, since everyone hates Bama 
They will.  Kendrick is at Centennial. 
Uga seems relaxed.

10th in 15 seasons
I have been waiting for this game for my whole life. GO DAWGS!!!!
Georgia has absolutely my favorite mascot. Damn good dog.
**FUN FACT:** Raekwon Davis, who leads Alabama with 8 sacks, will start tonight despite credible allegations that he harassed opposing student-athletes on at least 8 documented occasions.
Man I got a bad feelin about this game...roll tide 
Hey Michigan fans, Georgia went 8-5 last year too!
I like yew
Im BAMA all the way bro!!!
Also the memiest... if bama wins, UCF will clinch first in a few recognized selectors. They will literally have a natty.
Good Doggo
Kinda wish it was just one game thread so we could break reddit
Arrrrghhhhh
Will Alabama ever not be the team that''s favored?
Have a feeling an SEC team will win tonight, call me crazy but just a feeling 
What for? Also are you going to go?
I don''t speak for all UT fans, but the sentiment I''ve seen around here is that we''re rooting for Alabama because of Pruitt.
But bears like to hang out by the river, which is just a smaller ocean, and the ocean has tides.
I am also curious
Go Giant Meteor! 
Get hype
OKAY THIS IS FOOTBALL BUT DID YOU JUST?!  LOW BLOW. UGA IS A G O O D B O Y E AND YOU KNOW IT!
Which number will be greater?- number of plays ran in the first quarter - number of commercials shown in the first quarter 
[deleted]
Yea next week 
We gonna break Reddit either way
I just took two imodium so I don't accidentally shit myself during this game
Offseason a couple of hours away
I rooted for UGA against OU, but now it's time to return to reality. ROLL TIDE
This should be fun to watch. They need to have these post-championship exhibition games more often 
This stadium is empty as hell...?
A drunk UGA fan in my section just got ejected. Kickoff isn't for half an hour. Go Dawgs.Edit: I asked the usher why he got kicked out. Usher shook his head and said "just bein' disruptive!" 
Well, since there isn't a non-SEC team to cheer for....Go Dawgs!
mad props to the band
I have seen us win enough. Nothing like some quality dodgeball.
People are less than happy about it. 
[I wonder what this dude is doing tonight](https://youtu.be/etMlNW5w-50)
The last time they weren't, they beat Georgia 38-10.
Isn't Rick Flair, like, broke?
Go, you silver britches! 
Everyone still in line
Let's go UGA
aww UGA has a little CFP patch on his jersey
Commercials by 2
We were favored over them in 2015. Didn't end well
in *your* opinion - which team at the end of the game has more yards from their RB's?
Man it would suck major dick to pay thousands for tickets and miss the kickoff because security is being held up
I'm looking into public policy/public affairs. They are the second school I heard from, but I applied to 10 schools. So I have some time.
Welp boys, its been a great season! Win/Lose it's the last game of the season. Tomorrow begins the shitposting!
ELI5?
My left hook just went viral
People there are saying literally everyones still trying to get past security 
The South. Where media complains about the stadium being half empty 30 minutes before kickoff.
Uhhh.... Georgia sucks!That work?
The President of the United States is there. Security is probably tighter than an airport. And probably completely shut down when he was getting in.
Thanks Harvard.  You gonna be here all night?!
I want the team with a live dog as its mascot to win
Pats were a dynasty before Bama was.
Lines are a madhouse People were threatening to riot
I bet the Georgia and Alabama players are all excited for the Kendrick Lamar concert that they punched a ticket to
Just switched to my gameday Depends^tm so I don't have to worry about it. 
Commercials. For 2 reasons:1. SEC game2. Alabama is in it.
Gotta get those cheap pre game natty lights in before you go in the stadium 
No offense to these two teams fans - I believe both teams belong - but boy am I not interested in this game. An in-conference title game is just a major downer for me, and it would be that way for any conference. At least it''s in Atlanta, that''s pretty cool I guess.
Fuck Bama. That is all.
Why am I watching this
Entrances are stupid at the new stadium which causes congested concourses.And, security lines are probably ridiculously long tonight.
Yes. 
So I heard someone mention that apparently the ticketing app literally had an update today maybe? So that might cause issues 
You haven't been shitposting already?
UCF amirite?
Word is security is holding up the lines getting in.  
It''s been a great season for everyone BUT Tennessee. Poor poor Tennessee 
Cant tell if stadium is full or if stadium isnt full.
Anyone trying ESPN Command Center. It''s interests me 
I''m just here to watch an SEC team lose in the national championship game.
Kick off ain't til 8:17
First president since Nixon to attend apparently. 
Or a dream come true if you ask my wife.
Well I don't think I'm gonna be able to watch this since WatchESPN is already not working and the game hasn't even started
After Clemson, I went about my week knowing this night was coming. For some reason it hasn't registered, until 15 minutes before kickoff, and now my hands are sweaty from moms spaghetti. 
Idk why i am either
Yeah it''s definitely one of the downsides of a playoff system, even if this possibility is pretty rare
I usually force my dog to wear a red and black sweater HOWEVER it has houndstooth on it...  We are currently having a staring contest as I try to decide if she's going to wear it
I have a friend who's dad played at Vandy and he says that his dad's claim to fame is that he once tackled Herschel Walker.
Auburn fans, I have a question. If an Alabama fan, you, and a Georgia fan were all standing in a straight line... Alabama fan naked behind you, one inch in, and a Georgia fan in front of you, you one inch in  him, would you move forward or backward to get out?
Definitely bama of the nfl. Give bear bryant his due, Bama is a historic team. The Pats are only the Bill and Brady era, keep it up and they may get to Bama status
Of course they talk about Baker Mayfield lol
Is my Georgia bandwagon flair showing up? I haven't even watched a college game this season but LETS GO DAWGS 
Definitely Alabama. I honestly think this will be a blowout.
ESPN is main telecast with Chris, Kirk and the sideline reporters. ESPN2 is a homers telecast with Alabama and Georgia announcers.
Every time david pollack talks i lose more faith in humanity.
Do they always use the wrong year on the Bama helmet?
Fuck it /r/cfb, fade my flair.
I dunno. I mean we all know who the REAL national champs are, amirite? 
For the second straight year.
ngl, band in that script A is fuckin dope
7 day free trial for sling tv or youtube tv
[security is tied up because the gates were closed for an hour to let the President in](https://twitter.com/AndyScholesCNN/status/950513693896343552)
Yes
I really enjoyed it during the playoff games cause it showed the wire which is a view I always love 
The concert that isn't even taking place inside the stadium!
Driving back from Pasadena I believe?  He's the one who went to Pasadena on a scooter.  I don't know if he made it yet.
Wow, there goes his money
Happens when you spend all that money on being stylin' and profilin'.
That it is...welcome to the bandwagon! lol
DILLY DILLY!!
Try slingtv free trial if you can. ESPN is a lot more stable on there.
Fat Bert is at this game with the water champ Tom. 
You makin' fun of us because of our readin' and arithmetic?! Shots fired! 
Wow I didn''t know that Alabama''s defense was good but that feature by ESPN convinced me

Final score prediction???? lets hear it
Prediction: there will be a lot of red in the stands tonight
This guy asking the hard hitting questions.
I just heard the mush mouth ex-Heisman winner from Michigan on ESPN say that a guy runs great in space and hit sticks his opponents 
Winner of this game plays UCF right?
Seriously? Quarter threads...? C'mon. 
Lets go!!
This is why I come to these threads.Also, Go Green!
I hope an SEC team wins.
Georgia wins- UF fans mad- UCF REALLY doesn''t have national champions claimGO DAWGS
31-17 DAWGS ON TOP
It''d be easier to root for UGA if that dickhead LB didn''t shit talk Baker:(
For an HOUR?
28-24 Dawgs
Can you live in that moment, as best you can, with clear eyes and love in your heart? With joy in your heart?
24-17 UGA 
\#FireTimTebow
Due to unforeseen flipped couches after the Rose Bowl I don't think my mental health or liver could handle the liquor tonight. I may regret this. 
Replies to that tweet is why I hate Twitter so much. My god what a cesspool.
But when, tho?
Did I read somewhere that Frost and Malzahn were doing a live film room stream? Anyone know if that''s true and if so where I can find it?
Nah, UCF already won
I wouldn''t have my drinks any other way 
:narduzziface:
17-10 bama
Roll Tide
That would make me so happy.
typical
Not to oversalt a salty thread, but can someone tell me if the trophy UCF thing happened?
Sideline show is more of a shit show. But not necessarily in a bad way. 
I think I'm gonna vomit
I''m a big fan of the movie Saving Private Ryan. When I look at this matchup, one line from that movie comes to mind: “Earn this.”Neither team has earned this tremendous honor. The Big Ten has established itself as the premier conference in the nation and the southern conspirators were successful in their quest to rid them of representation the the playoff. 
Go Dawgs
I''d imagine that''s gonna be on the SEC network with finebaum, but that''s just a guess. 
Red if true 
Nice to see he was able to take some time off from golfing to be there!
Prediction: Saban will get thrown out in the fourth quarter for yelling at the refs
Watch ESPN or on one of the ESPN's on cable
Each thread gonna be 10K+
Lol why did they show Oregon in the Championship commercial? 
Quit getting my hopes up.
Does the game actually not start until 8:15? If so, that''s super annoying
If I remember correctly last year each thread had like 10k comments so it''s needed to keep threads from getting really out of hand. It also forces people to talk about what''s going on, not what happened two hours ago.
I'm rooting for meteor tonight
lol, touche
Something we can agree upon.
You forgot auburn. This is national Fuck Auburn Day. 
Is the OP not loading for anyone else?
you gotta go forward
Drink Water
@ClayTravis: In an ultimate troll move I''m told @realDonaldTrump turned down @espn interview request and will be doing local Bama radio broadcast interview at end of first quarter instead.
Where have you been? The past 4 title games have done this.
I want to like Georgia's chances, but if r/cfb has taught me anything, it's that no one beats Bama during a waning crescent.
How the fuck is the season already over? I feel like I was only just getting worked up for FSU...win or lose, I am not ready for the long night before kickoff weekend.
[Let's Go Bane!!](https://youtu.be/UsoYwysCdfY?t=74)
Sucks for the fans, but better safe than sorry in the current times.
It will likely be necessary.
You misspelled Big 12
Is this a hard 8pm or an ESPN 8?
817 to be exact 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkZ5e94QnWk
I'M NOT NERVOUS YOU'RE NERVOUS
49-17, Georgia
LOL.really cant talk there bub
24-20 Bama
True. 
What was that commercial? In what world did Ohio State win a title in 97?
Final score prediction: 35-24 Alabama on top. 
Wtf the 1997 National Championship was not Ohio State vs Arizona State. What the fuck was that commercial Gatorade
Keep choppin''
The Tide is turning and yet I still have no Dawg in this race.
As a Florida fan, I think I actually begrudgingly support the Dawgs tonight. Like, Fuck Georgia. But also, The East needs some love. And Fuck Bama.
Its harvest time, so...y'know. We grew them. Already. Its time to harvest the championship. Work with me on this metaphor here, ok?! Haha
At a bar in Athens.  Very noisy. Much student.  So loud.
Keep drinking.
Sony Michel is going to be the X-factor for the Bulldogs 
All we need is one difference maker**except we need one at almost every position.
or accidently yelling at kirby forgetting he doesnt work for him anymore.
Time for Kirby to mark the end of the *Saban Era*.
That was actually a pretty cool Gatorade commercial with the old NCG highlights.
Espn 8pm8:57 kickoff 
Win it for America Bull Dogs
Dont! In a recent conversation with my wife, after some Googling... The Scots wore Houdstooth to signify they didnt wanna fight! We need the fight in the Dawg! source :http://www.al.com/sports/index.ssf/2013/11/university_of_alabama_fights_u.html
My probably terrible prediction. Don''t bet against Saban. Georgia has the kind of O Bama can handle all day. Game isn''t very exciting. Bama wins, 31-10
My nuts are so far up my stomach rn
Nah, just ESPN3 users and Auburn fans.
I hope they let Eli Gold interview him. That'd be hilarious. 
it''s their natty count
QUICK HUG A GOERGIA FAN
Each and every player in the Big Ten deserves the Heisman more than Baker Mayfield
You. I like you.
Shouldn't it have been UCF?
I hope your right 
Gotta be an ESPN 8PM, so figure 8.25.
8:17 officially
Well, they said kick off in 20-25 minutes about 10 minutes ago, so I'd say ESPN 8
not to prematurely crown georgia or anything, but they haven't lost to *anyone* not named auburn this year.....wait.
It will be a higher scoring game than people think, it will be 5-3 alabama
https://twitter.com/AndyScholesCNN/status/950513693896343552
Least excited I've been for a National Championship game in a very long time.
ESPN 8. Kick set for 817 I believe 
SEC! SEC! SEC!
Big if true.
Dear Lord please don't let us go up 28-3
Why not? Who''d Baker shit talk?
Can both teams lose?
I guarantee you someone has made a porn in which the CFP trophy was used as a dildo 
What's everyone watching? I can't choose between the main telecast or the homers telecast. 
Ever since the whole UCF fiasco i just have trouble viewing this game as the championship knowing that rutgers never got a fair shot
Guy has a right to attend games that he wants but I'd rather he stay home to keep politics out of sports and i'd would've had the same opinion 2 years ago.
u got it next year kansas bro
It's every post.
**FUN FACT:** With 222 career victories as head coach, Nick Saban needs just 862 more to tie Mike Krzyzewski.
Sorry i dont speak French.
Go Georgia, I suppose. Ruff
My butt is clinched.
Man I love these game threads. Been using them ever since I joined up and no matter where in the world I am I got yall to talk football with. I appreciate it yall. (Even clemson fans)
They need every minute with the throngs of people still getting in the stadium.
I'll cut a toe off if Alabama shuts them out tag me idgaf
What a very Michigan way of problem solving.^sorry 
I''m just here for the Kendrick Lamar concert 
that dude's shirt behind des made it look like des had a big ol' ponytail of dreads lol
[removed]
et tu, Dez?
35-17 Bama. 
If you have Xfinity, watching it through [tv.xfinity.com](https://tv.xfinity.com) is much smoother than ESPN's website itself
the line that came to my mind was *'I thought you liked it in the ass'*
Cant argue with that
Chill
Hell yeah. Roll tide!
No bamboozles pls

rooting for uga because of all the good music that has come out of athens. what has tuscaloosa every done for me?
From a Canadian watching the natty...does the ESPN feed get sweet ads like the super bowl (not quite the same level, but something unique) or is it just the usual shit?
Coach K is no Geno Auriemma
this is gonna look like that bills jags game last weekend isnt it?
Dude this is like your 7th title game in 10 years. You gotta be used to this by now I'd think

Fuck me. I don't know whether or not to be happy. He picked Bama last week.
Since, oh... 2012, about this time?
kinda wish we had a live mascot.. just imagine an elephant wearing a big ass Bama jersey
I am going to die either way confirmed 
Fuck Auburn!
YOU GOT WHAT YOU ASKED FOR MAX!

Why is the stadium only half full? 
If you want to crown them, CROWN THEIR ASS

Hell yes! Corso picks Bama! 
Oh shit he picked alabama rip
Not so much. 
I would eat ass if this turned out like the Titans game with Georgia winning a comeback 
GO MF'ING DAWGS
Yes, *yeeeeees*, Alabama has been Corso Cursed! **IT. IS. SPOKEN.**
8:15 kickoff?! WE WERE LIED TO
Which toe we're talking about here?
This is the one time year I reluctantly, and struggle with, rooting for Alabama.    The Dark Side has won for a single night.
My gut tells me this is going to be a lopsided victory for Alabama, but here's to hoping it's as exciting as the Rose Bowl.
24-21 is low scoring? This game will probably be 9-6
FUCK. CORSI PICKED US. GG Dogs
Should I watch the ESPN High SkyCam to pretend I'm sitting in the cheap seats?
Just the usual for now. Give it a few years though
Corso picked Bama. Pack it up boys, we're champs.
CORSO WHAT ARE YOU DOING
SABAN: I will do what I mustSMART: You will try
Because the cheapest tickets are $2000
I'm staying awake long enough to watch the game begin. Then I'm probably going to pass out. 
#SEC SEC SEC
I read that as well. Supposedly leaking on the UGA 25. 
Reminder the championship dolphin picked Alabama
Delayed entry because of security for the President
[or maybe...](https://giphy.com/gifs/jack-nicholson-nodding-anger-management-S3Ot3hZ5bcy8o)

Sounds like South Carolina in a nutshell.
If Georgia wins, I win $100, sooooo#GoDawgs
oh pls no
Is it just me or is that national championship trophy but ugly. Bring back that crystal. 
Here we go, Immovable Object vs Unstoppable Force
I''m going to miss these post during the off-season. 
Does it count if it's a spite pick, though?
When you play the Georgia Bulldogs, you gonna feel the Bulldog BiteRack rack rack rack rack
:(
Tryna do some quick maffs on this but it isn't adding up.
Do you believe you're gonna win this fight tonight?
Hurricanes and being left out of the playoffs, that's really the reason lol
i wish gus johnson was calling this game ^(/s)
Boys I've been waiting on this one since I can actually remember. I'm ready. Go Dawgs!! 
Trump arrived and fucked up the gate 
CORSO CURSE. GG DAWGS
Corso .. it is finished
How does this work? Do they sell half the tickets to bama and the other half to Georgia? Or is Georgia gonna have a huge advantage?
Oh shit the game is about to start!  [Let me set the mood](https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/salt_pour1a.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200)

Agree with Pollack, which is weird.  Sony and Chubb aren't going to decide it.  Fromm is going to be the deciding factor.  Not exactly a bold take though.
I would be cool if they broadcast the national championship of policy debate one year. K-State is like the Alabama of that sport.Except instead of asking "could Alabama beat the Browns" the question is like "could K-State take-down the Canadian Parliament." 
The o/u is 46. He's really out on a limb there. 
You know it.
Do you wanna get tagged? Cause this is how you get tagged.
Max MVP if Georgia wins
Congrats on your Victory Via Corso, Georgia
I really love this Kirby Smart / UGA commercial btw
Saban plz
Idk if I'm ready
2-0*
I don't think you can consider yourself an all-time great dynasty if anything less than a championship is a success.
Bama
When will Georgia fans realize that they cheer for a mediocre football program? They are the only real football school in one of the Top 5 states for high school football. Atlanta, which is right down the road, is the biggest city in the south. They have perhaps the best brand recognition in college football. But they haven't won shit since 1980 (almost 40 years!), which makes them no better than a middle of the road program. The most delusional fanbase in the nation refuses to admit this.
one thing we can all agree on: AUBURN SUCKS
In 
i'd say saban is an eternal demon and could catch him...but krzyzewski is the basketball version of the same beast. so...
SEC smugness*
Saban is like, really Smart. 
Corso I'm going to miss you so much. I have tears welling up in my eye. 
God country music fucking sucks
Drink until your team is playing in the game. GO HOKIES!!!!
never in my life did i think i would root for alabama as hard as i am about to root for alabamarow tie
Just like last week.
HELL YEAH CORSO
Implying Alabama can make a field goal
I've decided that I want Alabama to win this game.  That way when we get our way with them (again) it will mean more.Plus, they're already a dynasty.  This is our "CFP Winners" table.  No new faces allowed.
CORSO CUUUUUURSE
Damn I'm hyped 
whutchu gonna do whutchu gonna do meowwww
As long as its an entertaining and close game throughout then i'll have no complaints of who wins
Tulane ‘98: never forget
Damn the whole country counting on us to beat alabama . 
I'd watch that
It took us all fucking year but we are finally back where we belong.This time there is no Deshaun Watson or Mike Williams to fuck it up.
Which toe?  The big one on the right foot.  Go big or go home.
The only way to watch this game is the Sounds of the Game broadcast. Who gives a shit about what "experts" say? Let the teams and bands speak for themselves and entertain us.
5-2 in 4OT
UGA 24-21. Field goal wins it in last play. 
;)
it would just mean more
congrats on the win dawgs
Winning design got picked but didn''t get built in time for tonight. It''s still coming. 
6-3 LSU
Wooo look at this shoot out
Whoever voices those preseason intros gets me so hyped
Don't have a rooting interest either way, but I hope we get a helluva game. I'm just glad it's not Dabo!
Can't even download necessary software on my work laptop for tomorrow, so watching the game instead. THIS IS FINE EVERYTHING IS FINE
This is it, decides who will be the champion of all 49 states
B ^U ^^T ^^^T ^^^H ^^O ^L E
The thread says the game is at the Superdome but it is at Mercedes-Benz Stadium.
My usual watchESPN experience:Huddle, freeze.Unfreeze, commercial.Freeze,  unfreeze, about to kickoff, Freeze, unfreeze turnover happened somewhere, freeze, etc. Seriously, someone should record their experience and create stats on how much time was froze and how much game they saw, actual gameplay, etc. I would say no more than half a game.
My jimmies are ready to be rustled
And mobile tickets are messing up.
googles!
I expect this game to finish around midnight central time. Thanks ESPN
2 and a half hours of commercial, 30 minutes of game.
Lee Corso said even his grandson, 7, told him to pick Alabama so Georgia would win 
So many empty seats
Corso picks Bama: Key pregame victory for Georgia 
18 mins til kickoff lawl
I see this as a 50-50 ball game50%-Bama wins 3050%-Bama wins by 10
To all the Auburn fans out there:  https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/
lotsa empty seats.
hot damn what does that make SC?
I like this guy
real funny guys who put this mike's hard in my hand 
Best brand recognition in college football?
*59
Corso Curse! Yes!
Go Dawgs!!
We will be over 1000 comments before kickoff. 
Literally just reading this and had to take four drinks. I won''t survive the pregame. 
Can I watch PylonCam?
God I hate WatchESPN. Plays commercials no problem, God forbid I want to watch the actual game
Is this the record for the biggest family reunion ever?
Thanks Harvard!
Go with the main one so you can suffer with us.
Go UGA! Hope this is the corndawg bowl next year! 
Corso actually picks correctly about 2/3rds of the time.
Dilly Dilly! 
> They have perhaps the best brand recognition in college football. Imma let you finish but...Texas, Bama, ND, Michigan, etc.Speaking of not winning anything for decades...Guess what? It happens.
Should have gotten the SEC Network team to call this
Is it me, or is the stadium somewhat empty? 
bama wins by 20 and i hate bama 
You're goddamn right
I CAN'T TELL WHICH FANS ARE WHICH IN THE STANDS. 
Why are you like this
It''s basically Anakin vs Palpatine.
Such a beautiful stadium.
Oh goddamnit Kirk
Oh
Best commentators hell yeah
Trumps there?Damn team meteor sounding good rn
Wut
Jimbo at TAMU will be the first Saban assist to beat Saban. Mark. My. Words.
Missed PAT
Cool, ESPN App just cutout on Corso's pick. Looks like it's going to be one of those kind of garbage nights. 
"This commercial break brought to you by AT&T presented by Allstate" 
Why is it so hard to find the actual kickoff time for these games? I''m uninterested in ESPN pre-game crap. 
I know...what the hell? The championship was split between two teams, neither of which played in the game that the commercial called the national championship.
Well the finebaum thingie on the SEC network had half as many commercials as the regular cast for the semis. Definitely has my eyes again this go round. The only time I ever see commercials is CFB. TV is horrid with commercials, omfg.
The CFP is putting everything in a garnet and gold color scheme and I really don't mind it
Y'all ain't aTm so y'all can't blow that lead.
I like you.
Coaches fucked us.  We should be playing in this game.
Agreed
I feel like uga is going to be really good for the near future so idk if I'm so excited about them starting their dynasty so fast
Secret Service is manually checking every single person getting in. This is making the lines way too long
Like they''re some sort of iPhone?
All those empty seats because CHICK-FIL-A IS ACTUALLY OPEN AT THE STADIUM, whoop whoop! 
I am just here for the UCF and Anti-SEC circle jerk 
HERSCHEL WALKER THEM DAWGS IS HELL DONT THEY
WatchESPN is predictably down. 
The real question my friends is *do you believe you can win this fight tonight*
I just hope they don''t bring it up too much
more like 18 mins until the pre-kickoff commercials begin, then the intro video, then commercials, then coin toss, then commercials.
with those prices i dont see how anyone could afford it
Over/Under 5 times Kirk says "physicality"
Roll tide?
It is so surreal that i am watching UGA play in the National Championship...DILLY DILLY! GO DAWGS! 
So everyone paid 2k per ticket at the game?
Is watch espn freezing every 5 seconds for anyone else?
Completely neglected to get a growler of Dogfather from my favorite dog-based brewery Black Husky yesterday so I have to settle for Lagunitas.Here's to a close game!
Deeply upsetting to me that the fucking pirated stream I'm watching is better than the one I'm paying money for. Thanks ESPN; why am I sending you any money?
Thank God Gary Danielson is not calling this game

[Over an hour to get through security apparently](https://twitter.com/drewwill/status/950531811700084742)
Love how all 15 or so feeds have the same feed.
I was thinking the same thing. 
Security being held up at the stadium. Lines outside barely moving, if at all
Trump is fucking up football now too. Lots of people couldn't get in because of is security.
LETS GO DAWGS!!!! SIC EM''!!!!!!!!
I'd like to begrudgingly say, "Go Dawgs!"
I wanna hear Herbie take a dump on UCF...
I'm here to shitpost and say Fuck Bama
So you have to watch the commercials during the pregame. 
I am about to bet on the under. Wish me luck boys!
For that exact reason probably
Not many. 
Smart is like, really Saban 
Casual fan here... anyone know if this "film room" thing will be worth watching? Or should I just stick with the normal feed?
I can''t tell if it''s empty or full of people wearing red shirts.
[deleted]
i've never hosted H8 in my heart am i doing this right?
Can't wait for his tweet about how he almost won a Superbowl by himself 
“SEC collectively is down” Such a true statement. Three teams and then everyone else 
[Dear America: Like it or not, we're your team and you know it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q0f9lOWPU0#t=1m44s)
I hope the stands fill up soon 
Texas A&M has the best brand. The iPhone of cfb.
Can Georgia beat Alabama? I don't know, that's a good question.Perhaps though the better question is if Alabama can beat the Browns.
I hate how they keep billing this as a home game for Georgia.It's 90 minutes from Athens to Atlanta and 3 hours from Tuscaloosa. It is really nothing big
Go Dawgs!
Downvote not for your hate, but simply because florida. Cuz H8 FEEDS THE DAWG!!!
I don't care who wins. I like elephants and I like dawgs. I just want to watch a good game before the cold, dark offseason.
"Earned their way here"*Fucking triggered*
Lets go Dawgs!
Garbage except for that one time they probably threw Ole Miss money bags at Clowney and lucked out with the SEC's dominance for a few years thanks primarily only to Bama, so they ended up with the scraps of what Bama didn't want.
Best animation
You can't argue these two teams didn't deserve to be hereTry me. I will show no Mercer
Who hurt you?
I'm showing it was [presented here](https://twitter.com/RedditCFB).  It's cute.  Edit: [video](https://twitter.com/RedditCFB/status/950523272898187265).
Jimbo is going to tank. Dude can't win without a generational talent supporting him.
i''m conflicted on who to cheer for
<3
as it tradition
He is genius after all. 
Hooray?
this animation is straight outta ncaa 04 lol
Poorly animated Saban assistants H Y P E.
THIS GRAPHIC
It only took Watch ESPN 10 seconds before it starts freezing. Fuck this shitty app wtf ESPN
RTR. 
Why is it so awful? I just don't understand why it is always so bad. It is always choppy and buffering.
did they get this animation from that japanese company that makes fun of US current events?
Herbie looks like he's been researching those pre-game buffets pretty hard.
This is an excellent animation
Anybody know what channel espn is doing the game with other cfb coaches commentating?
Was this CGI assistant thing done in a third world nation?
8:15 dawg 
I believe I can walk on water, is that good enough?
would you rather fight 1 elephant sized bulldawg or 100 bulldawg sized elephants?
DRINK
A new contender arrives
Im here hit stick and bust dick.
That animation looked nothing like Saban
This intro seems hostile to UCF
was that supposed to be a meme
Let's teach them damn Bulldogs to BEHAVE
Let's go Kirby 
And he saw that it was good.
What you don't like 4 hours of Gary gargling Bama's balls?
Do you like driving in your truck
YouTube tv. Free week trial.
Faculty, staff, alumni tickets are distributed equally.  Everything else is free for all. 
Wtf was that graphic 
Is coaches film room on WatchESPN?
either way, we end up with the most land 
East over West. Same ol' lines.
Why the fuck are there so many empty seats?I'd imagine the one completely empty section is for one of the bands, but what about the rest of the stadium?? A lot of empty seats it looked like.
You can certainly still debate if Alabama earned their way here. But muh narrative 
lol that animation
ORANGE PANTS SIGHTING
Every fucking game I've watched has froze. 
lol I'm sure this will go well
gotcha
Oh my god who makes these animations?!?
Why is ESPN wasting all this money on crappy moving shit.
I'm already dead.  It's not that bad.
Amazing graphic right there.
What is the animation budget?
pull yourself a dip. you're the original gator hater.
My guess is more Georgia fans showed up though
Yep, I especially love when it freezes just moments after the ball is snapped and everyone in the room gets to guess whether they think the play succeeded or not.  This you wonder what happened after it unfreezes just for you to see them walking around before the next play.
What the hell was that animation lol awful stuff
ESPN has the worst animations.
The graphics for the NFL playoffs and this game have been so, so bad lol
No
What a terrible animation
LET'S GO DAWGS! PUNCH YOUR TICKET TO UCF!
That''s was the worst graphic I''ve ever seen 
Final Score Prediction...Alabama: 5 UGA: 3
ESPN gonna go ham on the ads. wouldnt be suprised if the game last past 12
I have never heard them called Thunder and Lightning....
WatchESPN seems to be down for me :(
i'm rooting for georgia but i think bama will win so i'm trying to minimize all potential disappointment
Wait the hell was that
LETS GO DAWGS!
Wow that animation was creepy as fuck.
That graphic was awful 
Anyone else ready for The Bachelor premiere tonight?
lol. Someone's drunk already
Kirby is IMO the best of the Saban assistants. He would be the one I would pull back if i had magic
Alright, wtf was up with that weird robot coach shit
we've been trash for basically our whole history. We have 9+ wins only like 9 times in our history
A new challenger approaches 
Thunder and lightning you say?  Lightning?  And the thunder?
No one calls them Thunder and Lightning other than the announcers.
I''m a sucker for a good RB duo myself 
Main ESPN stream is obviously going to blow and freeze constantly... so which side stream are people watching instead?
That animation was tits lol
It is for me
Go White!
Not digging the “live” feature on the Reddit app. Too much chaos 
I'm taking a shot just for that shitty graphic
ESPNU is basically DirecTV sports mix only you don''t get to select the feed.
The 100 bulldawg size elephants would be so cute.
I wanted to stick that sword through my eyeballs.
I''m scared of this. I hope we play well and keep it close
Then dawgs is hell!
wtf was that graphic, and why did 3D nick saban look like he was 28?
You think it'll be that much?!
I liked how the coaches got sad...
Nick Chubb gives me his last name in my pantalones 
[GET HYPE!!!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JW5UEW2kYvc)
Yup. Switched to an internet stream.
Clearly not bama
I wanna know what the budget was for that sword graphic
If you really wanna get into the x's and o's then yes. otherwise, probably not.  
That was creepy
No time for indecision mate
UGA 6-1 BamaCalling it now
Is ESPN outsourcing their animation to RuneScape?
Can you guys feel the annoyance of all the fans trying to get in? I can hear the bitching from here.
I'm cheering for Georgia, but I know they'll bring up the Notre Dame game often and make it difficult for me.
NONE OF SABAN'S ASSISTANTS COULD JERK ALABAMA
The coaches film room? It is incredible for X's and O's but you won't feel the atmosphere or the calls on big plays, You really only hear the coaches voices 
That doesnt make any sense. Tickets were $2000 because there was high demand for them. 
What is this animation?
Like you didn''t know he was going with Bama?
ESPN NEWS
Roll tide baby. Lets goooooo
it's gotta be the Taiwanese.
When tOSU beat MSU last night, alls I could think about was that sweet, sweet land we lost. 
That fucking graphic, lol
Is that the Saban Barbie?
Welcome to it
Cheers from AZ and fuck bama
Lmao "First Quarter" threads. I predict in a few years we'll have "first commerical"
ESPN animations lately have been low quality and downright disturbing.
Derek Dooley couldn't beat Nick Saban? Oh really!?!? 
An offseason less colder and less darker than most because there's so much between offseason/season. 
If you have to explain everyday why Bama deserves to be there, you're losing.
Da fuck was that animation espn 
Lol that King Arthur style graphic was so silly.
Unpaid interns somewhere in SE Asia....
Do you own a truck?
lol nobody/s
So...is the ESPN stream down for anyone else? #HamsterServers
I'm drunk and sitting on the step pyramid at the Mexico pavilion in EPCOT. I might check the score on my phone or go buy a fifteen dollar margerita...or both...Hold up a second, Pakistan v. New Zealand cricket is going on right now? Got something to switch to if this game goes to the pits.
That animation is meme material
Who should I cheer for?
The Corso curse ends tonight. The injury curse ENDS TONIGHT. 
I love the ESPN animations ! 
If Saban loses this I think it's time to fire him... loses back to back National Championships, what kind of coach does that?! Kill me now. :'(
I feel the same thing.
That would be iconic. And boring. But iconic none the less!
The graphic of Fromm tossing the ball to himself between the commentators is kinda bizarre
No matter what happens, I just wanna say congrats to UCF on your National Championship! No matter what the media says, you're the true champion to Tennessee fans.
Who''s the third, State?
Or can UCF beat the Browns
take a drink every time the app crashes. You wont remember anything after halftime. 
**UNABLE TO PLAY VIDEO***The WatchESPN experience!*
What the holy fuck was that? Did ESPN pick up some Taiwanese animators? Is this where my money is going?
ESPN has obviously been using one of those Taiwanese animation companies for their animations this bowl season
shoutout to everyone rooting for team meteor rn
Those things were monsters, wtf
Don't insult runescape like that
More than likely. Almost 40 year title drought vs a team going for their 5th in 9 years.
Hello everyoneTHWGRoll.....tide? *ew*
What are they trying to accomplish with these trash animations
 Being in the state of Texas is his best chance for that. 
Crystal ball was cooler looking
[I'm so excited! IM SO SCARED](https://media.giphy.com/media/dLyfT21xFdwpG/giphy.gif)
Anyone got a GIF of this? Stuck in traffic rn
Alabama, go get ‘em. If we are both lucky, we''ll see each other again next year. Roll fucking Tide. 
Yo that graphic inbetween them is tight not gonna lie. 
Absolutely 100 bulldawg sized elephants
Thank god Disney owns the story! 
Mulling over what pizza to order like I always do with the championship and all I can think about is the impending heartburn. I've aged.
Down with bama!
The graphics guy is having a field day
BAMA
What's up with Bama's logo behind kirk, it looks like the Braves'?
*stable genius 
Kick Alabama's ass, Georgia! 
*Championship of Life
Not really. 
How the hell does a team score 1 point fam?
Your butt clinched a spot in the Championship? Now I gotta bet on the butt
Can you imagine how awkward it is for the players to film those little "do things at the camera silently so we can put it up on the screen" bits?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQh5sTT4GUs
 we can get disturbing coaches getting out of their chairs, but not NCAA 18??
We're eating gamecock wings in my house tonight. Hopefully they're not as salty as you. 
They are probably all in the concourse right now. Apparently, the stadium has a ton of shit for you to do before the game begins.
All you falcon fans remember giant Julio from a few weeks ago? Lol. I like the graphics tbh
Well, yeah, you'll go 11-0 vs former assistants when their teams' suck every single time lolI don't think a single one of the games in reference was even supposed to be close.  Cool stat tho
THIS GAME IN NOLA BABYYYYYYYYYYYYY
THUNDER AND LIGHTNING    DRINK
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQh5sTT4GUs
So much pre game bullshit. Just start already!
I'm just glad its not Clemson or OU
When did ESPN start featuring animations that look like they belong in those Asian animated videos about American news? At least go all the way and make them as wacky as the news video
What exactly is team meteor I've always wondered but never asked 
https://youtu.be/DttfyOeU3vw
Boy wouldn''t r/cfb love the quad match?
Ran the ESPN app all afternoon, and it just now starts shitting the bed.
Im going Georgia because I'm tired of Bama. Don't hate them, just tired of them. 
Espn only doing this to play that shit song
 What channel is The Puppy Bowl on?
So if I root for Alabama that makes me a bad guy, is that right? 
Fuck Bama, Fuck Georgia. LET'S DRINK
Yeah, he looking wide out there. The camera adds 10 lbs though, I think he ate 5 or so. 
If Chubb is thunder, he''s the crack of thunder. There''s nothing about him that is slow and rumbling 
H8 FEEDS THE DAWG
Thanks for solving that conundrum!
Heresy!
8 PM start time my ass
I think the winner of this game should be allowed to harvest the organs of UCF just so their fans shut up 
I would not be caught dead in ***Georgia***, like, oh my Gaaaaahd.
I'm getting network errors when trying to authorize with Spectrum?
Alabama A is Braves' logo with a mullet
LETS GET THIS STARTED MY BUTTHOLE CAN ONLY BE SO TIGHT AND I HAVE CLASS TOMORROW
What is up with Bama logo behind Kirk? it looks like Georgia colors not Bamas
WatchESPN is already down. What a garbage service.
This "UGA is built after Bama" shit is so stupid.A vast majority of these starters and a good number of backups are originally Richt recruitsWhich means that this team is built in the image of how Mark Richt wanted his team built and Kirby just successfully adjusted to his talent. 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQh5sTT4GUs
Oof
Hell yeah
GIF of the animation? Stuck in traffic rn :(
Sigh. ESPN app is so garbage.
ESPN with the team logos about to go "IT'S MORPHIN TIME"
What are they playing for? UCF is National Champs.
So who are the drunk personalities on voices this year
Can I start off the hot takes: If Lane Kiffin coached last years title game, Bama would be fighting for back to back titles this year
Lets go Dawgs. We in Atlanta lets get this W!
lol watch this be big 12 style shootout.
Chances we get a streaker today? I say 20%.
Either way one of your rivals will lose
I'm not going to the game and took a day off. I couldn't handle going in today 
DON'T JINX IT
#
Yes. You bring your school and family shame. 
Auburn fans already took that L against the REAL national champions
I'm thinking 4-2 Georgia with a clutch last second safety at the end to seal the win.
So awesomely corny.
I think UGA matches up better with bama than Clemson did, at least offensively. Clemson seemed pretty 1 dimensional and bama was able to contain Bryant well. UGA has a much more diverse offense and I think will matchup well with bama
Fantasy scouts, where y'all at?
[Not so fast](https://streamable.com/xq6kv)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQh5sTT4GUs
Jalen Hurts looks like he eats fudgsicles with a knife and fork.
Same. Too many people bitch and moan just for the sake of bitching and moaning. They're pretty cool.
Thanks
I''m a casual CFB fan: do pregame shows always feature these absurd graphics?
Fuck Auburn. 
IM STILL SALTY ROLL TIDE 
***LET'S GO LIGHTNING!!!!!!!***
[I'd rather be dead in Georgia than alive in Alabama.](https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1316649360/lucille_bluth.jpg)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQh5sTT4GUs
Truth 
I wouldn't advertise that
Need to get on the phone with ILM
Roll Tide. Much respect to Georgia and Smart. I don't think this will be an easy one, but Bama is mad and that is lethal.
Jalen Hurts never looks excited or anything
I know we like to hate on our instate brothers to the east but Bama didn't earn this shit. They bought it in some backroom meetings with the committee. Good Luck *cringe* Georgia. 
I mean if people are going to keep bringing it up you answer it 
You mean they've been high quality and incredible.
Sec championship part 2?*yawn*Edit: Wow didn''t expect this to trigger so many people lmao
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQh5sTT4GUs
Just relax and enjoy it
whoa r/collegebasketball has a land conquest goin on??
This game is going to be BORING.  Just like the Bama/LSU NCCG people are going to walk away from this disappointed.
Oh wow I totally missed that! I wanted to be at the event tonight but had to be out of town.I hope this is displayed in a place for UCF students and alumni can come pay homage.
I keep telling people, Saban has probably the worst record in college. About half the time he ends the season with a lower ranking than when he started.The other half the time, at best, he matches his pre season ranking.That's an obvious sign of mediocrity. And don't give me that "Whaaaa!" Whaaaa! He starts at number 1 every year!" bullshit 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQh5sTT4GUs
Good luck my friend
Watch your profanity 
As long as that doesn''t interrupt the Black Panther preview I''m good
So where do y'all steal streams?
[deleted]
The Jalen Hurts thing doesn''t blink enough, I don''t trust it 
This is going to be a fun game, here's to no injuries, good luck dawgs! Roll Tide!
Dammit WatchESPN stream is so fucking laggy. I wonder if this is just my work internet or if ESPN itself is lagging for others?
Why does jalen look like he's tryna hook up..
"beautiful" trophy
This is Jalen Hurts's excited face: *shows one face*    This is Jalen Hurts's shocked face: *shows same face*    This is Jalen Hurts's sad face: *shows same face*    
I am extremely ashamed of myself, but...I just can't pull for Bama.  The state of Georgia needs this to make up for the Super Bowl.  I am pulling for UGA
8pm kickoff - lying sonsabitches
I'm seeing waning crescent in atlanta per timeanddate.com
this is too accurate for the entire season
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQh5sTT4GUs
And yet you''re here...
I guess go UGA
Andddd Jalen Hurts just winked at me through my tv....I feel dirty and I need a shower
Chubb and Michel are beasts, but they won''t be able to run on Alabama like they did on OU
No.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQh5sTT4GUs
Somewhat. The bigger the game, the more the graphics 
I'd take NCAA18 with those graphics, even.
No
Agreed! 
This needs the LA Noire "doubt" meme
I'm not getting to watch this am I? Thanks watch espn...
Normally I would root for Georgia, but as a Cavs fan I need Bama to win this. Roll Tide 
Roll Tide 
I personally like the CFP trophy. But the crystal ball is cooler
r/CFBstreams
O-H?
Still think the trophy looks like a tube of lipstick...
Fuck you Nissan, I want to watch football
I''m gonna barf! GO DAWGS!!!
Yes, that's correct. Don't be that guy.
Anyone else think Fowler is just an ok announcer. Like he's fine but he isn't very dynamic when he calls the games.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQh5sTT4GUs
You know Danny Etling only had 2 interceptions. They're pretty much the same 
I'm not mad, just disappointed.
Team scores TD, attempts PAT, gets blocked, they recover it themselves in their own endzone, other team gets 1 point. Happened twice ever.
What are the odds a punter is the mvp of the game?
How have they not figured it out yet?
bring back the crystal ball motherfuckers
It's sad that I have to find an illegal stream on Reddit because WATCH ESPN is garbage. 
What has been the best theme song? hisssssssstoryyyyy, centuriesssssss, or do you believe you can win this fight tonight?
When does the game actually start?
I never realized how boring Herbstreit is.
You should see him pissed off.
No care! 
it does! tOSU gonna be loaded if they survive the week. 
Christ start the game already 
But I like the pomp and circumstance, the institution that is Corso picking Bama.
What is Sabans Horcrux?
It''s Charter Spectrum''s verification servers this time. Fuck everything.
First time thinking of watching the coach''s room? Worth it, or watch regular feed and get coaching from /r/cfb instead?
The amount if game threads for the CFPCG is too damn high
If they want to expand the playoff to 8 teams they better start paying the players
Winner still gets the crystal. 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQh5sTT4GUs
And yet you're here....thanks for watching
Fuckin' Jalen "Capt. Jack Sparrow" Hurts
We're gonna see some serious trickeration and physicality in combination with SEC speed to see if Saban's Assistant can keep his Chubb dae we need more buzzwords 
I hate the live feature of this thread... I can''t read anything!
Meet me in the toilets behind Space Mountain
I've been watching the feed for 2 hours. 7pm hits, *all* feed channels crap out.It's a real kick in the nuts for cord cutters. 
You know what'd be awesome?If Jake Fromm had a really high-pitched, Mickey-Mouse voice.
You've got plenty of titles!
Get em Tebow
Is Jalen Hurts Terrence Trent d'Arby reincarnated?
I'm still hoping for a full team fight during the run outs. Everyone is suspended from the game and both teams lose. 
I just hope they all have fun 
Go to the US (?) building. It's a bar and should have the game on 
Not watching the game 
INB4 People start put in Tua
Does the Georgia upvote train go "Chubb-at-UGA-chubb-at-UGA-chubb-at-UGA...." etc?
I'll give it a try!
I wonder what Jalen Hurts is like.  Random thought.  Looks like a chill dude
The cgi seems new for this season. I cannot recall it before
well then git gud.
Georgia/Alabama fans, would you rather win this game or have your GPA boosted by 1 full point?
Nick Saban went down to Georgia, he was lookin' for a game to stealHe was in a bind, he was way behind,He was willin' to make a deal...And if you win you'll get this shiny football made of gold,But if you lose, Nick Saban gets your soul!
R/cfbstreams
Lucky. I can''t even order pizza. Live too far out of town. 
Take my upvote. Every single time 
A lovable dog, or a euphemism for a period?
Thanks for the game recap. Guess your work is done, you should take the rest of the night off.
Do they keep pointing out that Alabama and Georgia border as subliminal geography refresher for drunk fans across the nation?
Herschel would eat Tebow for breakfast
Beautiful trophyIt's pretty fucking meh. Coaches poll/BCS one is way better
I'M TRYING TO WATCH THIS GAME LEGALLY BUT CHARTER IS A PIECE OF SHIT WHO FOR SOME REASON CANT HANDLE UPSCALE WITH TRAFFIC
Pls
Hold ups at the gates. Trump is in the building and mobile tickets are a problem.
Oh god we are going by quaters
I need that Barry sanders tie 
AyeSee you in the GDT tomorrow.
Bruh...
Alabama made us 1 dimensional... we didn't have that problem the rest of the year. Once they popped Kelly B a couple of times the game might as well have been over, since our passing game died then. 
Damn, when is kickoff?
I''m getting the unable to play video error message
Hurts looking like a Key & Peele character
The ESPN stream has been terrible all year. It's like they have enough bandwidth for 100 people
This game is going to be as disappointing as the Bama/LSU NCCG.  It's going to set back CFB a decade.
Amen!No matter, whoever wins gets the distinct pleasure of splitting the Natty with UCF, right? RIGHT?
Thank you kind Internet stranger.   If you're ever down in Athens,  go to the Georgia Theater roof top for free great local sounds.
Over/under on when they actually kick this game off?
Hey guysI just took a mondo dookI'm ready now
I didn''t know Reddit had a live comments feature on mobile. That''s pretty cool. How new is it?
I''m not but cool
Food fight 
I'm a nervous wreck
I'm glad Tebow's making money
No. Normally not 
Solid commercial
We did that last year too
Yeah this is unusable 
I obviously missed it too, especially considering the new "Loading..." feature on every fucking post.  Had to find it in r/cfb twitter.  I'm sure they will display it somewhere cool!
Go Dawgs
what are yall mad about? just not winning last year or did something happen?
Watch espn fucking sucks
He''s safe and reliable. Not the kind of guy who makes you want to watch but not someone who is gonna fuck it up either. 
When they show graphics like the one they just showed with Jalen Hurts, I want you to imagine the player standing in a studio recording the segment.
When isn't the game on ABC? This has to be a bigger draw than whatever reality TV crap they are showing.
Jalen Hurts looks like a black Jack Sparrow. 
Or tel me what time kickoff actually is. Holy fuck this is annoying. Asshole Espn 
something something checkers, something something 3d chess 
Still a little pissed that they allowed Derrick Henry to come back and play up to 4 years at QB. Thinks he's JT Barrett.
Not a fan of the beer tap?
55-24
lmao i forgot about this
Oh, there's a game on tonight?
7:20
I would watch a scripted series with the Heisman winners. Give it a six-episode run; see what happens
Champions of life
Don't worry, the dawgs will die tonight in Atlanta. 
A 50/50 chance for either team to win. Either Georgia or Alabama wins. 50-50
First day out the reddit ban freestyle coming soon
first quarter hasn't even started yet and we're already 1200 Comments deepPrepare your butt reddit servers. We ain't usin' lube
Gotta ball out til they fall out
Hershel would whip Tebow's ass. 
Is anyone else using the live thread?? It''s really fast I can hardly upvote stuff
All these people complaint about two SEC schools but I bet y''all ain''t going to be watching Judge Judy tonight. 
Jalen Hurts' hair makes him look like a Basset Hound
Does anyone have a drinking game for this? I think sec mentions alone would kill me
Am I being dumb for hating that Heisman house commercial because with all the rivalries they put at the table, they have USC/Oregon against each other?
They could really boost the ratings for the Heisman presentation if they had a food fight mid-show
Annnd I''ve already died of alcohol poisoning. 
If you mean litterally incapable of making facial expressions. The yes
Quarterly threads? Let's fill it up to 10k with 5 minutes left each time.
Ducks are food not friends
Shit give me the gpa
Heisman House Foodfight should just have a random dude with a blurred out face running around with crablegs in the background not being acknowledged by anyone
This sucks...
The same time Brady Hoke stops clapping 
Its sad the 2017 NCAA season is done after this game. But before you know it next season will begin. Then next season will end once more. Then the following season will start, and in the blink of an eye the championship game will reach 00:00 on the clock. Then one day you'll wake up dead.
817 is scheduled kick
[Oh shit!](https://res-4.cloudinary.com/rivals/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,t_large/lyvzbqep9vd2enjotujx)
How do I do it? 
Fuck KD
I imagine Tim Tebow has ripped his shirt off 0 times before that commercial 
Stripping
Has Watch ESPN ap been crap lately? My internet is fine
It never kicks off.
Everybody knows /r/cfb has the best coaches.
anyone else's stream just crash?
I love Tebow. Glad to see he's still doing good.
that's good news. 
Game starts 8:16 ET
Was that ever in question?
Thank goodness, I really wanted to see inside Nissan's Heisman House! 
midnight 
Deal as long as Tulane can be 1998 national champ 
C. Win and not live in Florida.
Over/Under for the time this game ends? My guess is 12:13 am
:)
55-24
Next year
Drinking can help with that friend. 
Let's be real. Herschel Walker would kick Tim Tebow's ass.
Stadium still so empty.
Which app?
817
Whatever happened to my “new” tab. Now that was a usable mobile feature!*Grumbles moodily I''m rocking chair
Wait, I messed that up.
Wait, was that a Nissan commercial that didn't have anything to do with Star Wars?? I didn't think that was even legal.
TIL Tebow and Mariota actually get angry sometimes
YA GODDAMN RIGHT! GO DWAGS! 
Because fuck ESPN
Fun fact. Lebron James has always won the NBA Championship in the year that Alabama has won the national championship.2011-12 - [Crimson Tide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_BCS_National_Championship_Game) vs. [Lebron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_NBA_Finals)2012-13 - [Crimson Tide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_BCS_National_Championship_Game) vs. [Lebron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_NBA_Finals)2015-16 -  [Crimson Tide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_College_Football_Playoff_National_Championship) vs. [Lebron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_NBA_Finals)idk if any Buckeye fans watching this are Cavs fans (I'm not), just something interesting.
The Nissan Heisman house commercials are the best commercials don't @ me
**I DO NOT CARE FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF AUBURN**
Tebow would be saying grace. not crushing cookies.
alabama does not know de way 
Ok, this food fight commercial is alright.
Nice!
He is a damn good dog too
I'm here, I'm sick to my stomach, my blood pressure is rising.Yep the Dawgs are playing a meaningful game today.Where is the liquor
ESPN has been fucking terrible with the graphics recently.  I mean, what do you expect?  They fired like 90% of their staff and I doubt they have competent graphics guy anymore.
I know, I'll be over here banging my head against the wall
Tim Tebow is *thirty* years old now...
Imagine if the Heisman House burned downThink of all the talent that would die
I''ll take the over on that. 
Here commenting about a game you're "not watching".....right.
Honestly, what scares me most is "before I know it" next season will start. Things move quicker as you get older, it seems.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsFBYq_h_J0
Fan-fucking-tastic ESPN! It's the National Championship game and WatchESPN app is sucking on a big fat one per the usual. MOAR LAVAR BALL STORIES PLEASE!!!!To Reddit College Football streams I go!
dude i'm just trying to watch football and drink
Either way one of your rivals will WIN.
The game''s comin up at 8:00 right after this! God I can''t till 8:10 when the game starts at 8:17
Wasn't trying to shit talk, FeelsBadMan. I hate UF too.
Watchespn is always a headache, and yes it's lagging here too 
Way later than that with two running teams. 12:50 at least. 
Heisman House needs to be a serious offseason tv show tho
Follow the journey of these legen-ermmm players that we could get to do this silly show.
UCF is the true National Champion 
Grats on the dook 
No
Cs get degrees bro, give me the natty
I understand your frustrations but it was a fantastic game last week. I'm okay if the Dawgs pull this off. 
Tim Tebow trying to look threatening is worse than his actual Nissan commercials
Starts at 8 they said..
The Mullet is in the film room
Auburn, lets close our eyes and pray this little storm blows over quickly
[Jalen's hair in that pregame segment be like](https://source.superherostuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/predator.jpg)
[deleted]
Over
I avoid the live thread for big gams. Like you said, too fast. 
That guy in the apron looked like Saban.
Fuck
Mariota throwing a cake is about as aggressive as you''ll ever see him get, I think lmao 
The Katherine Webb/Brent Musburger thing was 5 years ago
Yay?
Probably a good thing.
i will sho u de way
You should know it's Star Wars OR Heisman House!
@ /u/kcspotYou''re right.
Just drink till the selection of Alabama in the first place makes sense
I was so excited for this season and feels like yesterday. Then work and life got crazy and I only watched one non Michigan game before the bowl season. Oh well. Next year 
In 2019, apparently
Well in that case, GO GEORGIA!
The dude at the diner talking to Greg mcellroy looks like saban if he never coached football
He's an MMA fighter now lol
IT'S FUNNY BECAUSE HE'S A DOG
Isn't he in the medical program or am I thinking of someone else
In a thread that is about to move as fast as this thread moves we are all just talking to ourselves basically. 
Nah it seems to be a newer thing but I love it. ESPN had one for Monday Night Football a few weeks ago about Julio Jones dominating the Buccaneers and it was hilarious.
I think he would break almost everyone in the Heisman House
You have been downvoted, the downvoted boy is in full service tonight
its like he has a regular hair and then an extra hair hat on his head
tss fuckin hilarious commercial Nissan tss
and the cleveland browns will still suck
Well the plus for either defense is they don't have to worry about losing track of Hunter Renfrow this game.
817
Can the game just kick off! Jesus Christ 
Yup.  There were a half dozen teams just as good or better than Bama this year that were left out.  I hope UGA mops the floor with Bama.
I want 2 quarters of a good, competitive game. Followed by 2 quarters of Alabama rail-roading Georiga.
We ain't come to play school. 
Lately? 
Bull Tide!Roll Dog! or whatever it is!
As a straight man, I enjoy watching tebow rip off his shirt
Everyone is in line at the Chick-fil-a
Nice baggy khakis nerd
I bet OJ would make a killer addition to the Nissan Heisman House.
Who else is still denial we have to wait 8 months after tonight :/
Corso feeds the Dawg
Woah woah woah. How do you wake up dead?
Have you heard about our Gourde and savior?
Chaos, I speak to thee, give me a CFP overtime game with Georgia as winner.
Well I have heard of him
It''s awful. No way to keep up that quickly. 
Auburn University
Which channel is the coaches' roundtable on again -- ESPNU?
lol that's such an empty stadium.
I did two pregame number twos myself.
They always lie, I say.
For anyone interested. The Dan LeBatard Show will have Kenny G play the National Anthem on ESPN3.
Anyone else prefer to watch the coaches film room?
TO HELL WITH GEORGIA
They don''t do gma streams anymore :/
That would be awesome. Somehow Gus gets on the field in a hoody and throws a water balloon at saban, then blames it on a female fan. Georgia and Alabama teams suspended for life.
hi!
You'd have to punt to the 1 yard line every time and have no other amazing players on your team to do that lol
Tis better to live and die in Atlanta than to live a long, happy life in Alabama.
My prediction for tonight is that Bama loses 24-21 on a missed FG and we get to see Nick Saban strangle his kicker on live television
Somehow, this game just means less
Any large broadcast is always terrible for me
When is actual kickoff if y'all don't mind?
My favorite thing about football is all the commercials
mma fighter vs bad single a baseball player?no doubt
Listening to the national ESPN Radio feed, are they showing this massive security presence that the radio is talking about?
Georgia bull dog yoga pose make it look like he's ready to be ____ in the ___I won't use dirty words on this christian subreddit.
Tebow has god on his side though.
IT'S HAPPENING 
I missed the early bus home so now I won''t get home till 9:30 someone keep me posted 
THE JUICE IS LOOSE
Nice.
What
Vegas has Georgia winning by 12. This should be a boring game tbh. Bama is gassed out so bad already.
Plank, downward dog, or doggy style? 
Fuckkkkkkkkkkkk
This stadium has gotten ridiculous usage in its first year.
LOL the boos 
BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Prediction: breakout player tonight won't be on the fieldIt will be David Cutcliffe in the espn coaches film room
Hi Early!
spit on de false national champ 
Danny Waffle looks > Jason White
HERE COME THE BOOS
Booooo
KICK OFF ALREADY! I WANT FOOTBALL!
Because it''s impossible for me to browse /r/cfb and see this post without watching the game 
69
I thought it was a skinny small saban
Umm wtf
oh jeez rick
Lebron
What odds are you giving that Kendrick makes a political statement 
did the boo's outnumber the cheers? I think they did. Good. 
Ewww
But not every time they''ve won while he was a player. 
this thread is about to get very civil 
What
"Here's a football, Jalen, do something with your hands. Or just stare, whatever."
Geez that stadium looks *empty*. I mean, I know it's because of security and all that, but still....
TRUUUUUUUMP!
Those animations were so bad. Custom made in ncaa 14 i'm guessing.
Because ESPN has a contract for like the next 20 years? 
OH MY
BOOOOOOOO!!!
Booooo
[removed]
Booooooooooo
LMFAO
Boo! 
You'll be back before the end of the 2nd commercial break
That boo. ROFL
The national championship couldn't fill up the stadium?
lol wait whaaaaaat?! 
it's 8:10 what the fuck is the hold up...
Would trade Alabama winning the next 8 championships if this sub human garbage were out of office 
True, but i wanna see Saban lifting that dang ball up again. It was my flip phone screensaver in 2010.
Oh god
Ok the downward dog commercial was funny 
FUCK YOU
ESPN news
FUCK  YOU 
The Don 
oh man, I didn't think he was actually coming out to the field.Guess it's a good thing this is a SEC title game (for him)
needs more boos
tomorrow apparently 
Oh god..here come the comments
The ROTC Eunuchs?
You ugly motherfucker.....go fuck yourself.
about 7 minutes
Boo that man.
Why do we have to do all of this militaristic shit before every sporting event?
T R I G G E R E DRIGGERED
STAND FOR THAT FUCKING ANTHEM
Oh there's the president 
This introduction is huuuuuuuuuuugggge
disney cracking down hard on youtube streams
Lock the thread now lol
Yikes
i hate this.
NONONO GET HIM OFF THE FIELD
IDK WHAT I'M MORE SAD ABOUT. THE FACT THAT WE AREN'T PLAYING IN THIS GAME, OR THE FACT THAT THE OFF-SEASON STARTS IN 5 FUCKING HOURS. FUCK.
I don't think everyone is cheering you 
What in the fuck?
He's getting boo
THE CLOCK HITS ZERO AND THERE IS NO COLLEGE FOOTBALL FOR 236 DAYS.
Lol no politics guys
A wild Trump has appeared. 
keep walking 45. I have a game I need to watch.
Gross 
The fact that so many people bought tickets at those outrageous prices is an accomplishment. 
Saw a tweet saying its taking over an hour to get into the stadium.  It was bad last year, and the president wasn't there
8:15 I think.
so that's why the security hold up
“Unable to play video...an ~~unexpected~~ completely expected error occurred”.  So, it''s going to be like that ESPN.   
BOOOOOO
That''s out of left field
No.  it reminds me of CNN during the 2012 presidential election - they had 'holograms' to show the house seats and shit... it was really needless.  purely some marketing/pr people thinking about the uniqueness and not whether or not there was value in it.
[removed]
Hahahaha the Georgia and Alabama fans all go crazy for the president l. Pls don''t get mad 
Booooooo
There is a lot of empty seats.
now I'm REALLY rooting for meteor 
Oh look its the Annoying Orange
Go Team Meteor![Fuck uga tho](https://youtu.be/Az0JWl3JsDo)
Who are all these people cheering for him 
THE SEC LOVES YOU MR PRESIDENT 
About 11:30 eastern
Fdt
Hmm, I think the boo's won
Let the tendies hit the floor!
Don''t remind us 
815
Oh...  Oh my
Are they booing?
Uh oh
Boo the shit out of this guy.
Lmfao
Oh I'm sure this will be civil
Stadium is nowhere close to fullEntire endzone top level empty
Defend yourself men 
Sadly, this might improve our kicker lineup next season...
Perd...that's *exactly* what happened
Wife: "I can't tell if he's getting 'yayed' or 'booed'.Me: "Yes".
I really hate that man
What the fuck is this asshole doing there
USA USA USA 
Let's make this exciting and have all players wear the Oregon Duck mascot costume for the game.
Omg the boos
Trumps here, hopefully nobody kneels during the anthem, he might get mad and fire em
Why is there an oompa loompa on the field
Ummm, shouldn't our POTUS be working instead of wasting tax dollars?! ^^^^^^^/s
I told my girlfriend I'd do a cleanse with her this week and not drink, but I forgot this game was tonight... so, she's probably going to be mad that I'm 6 beers in before the game starts
OH GOD WHY
DONALD SPOTTEDDRINK
Boo this man, booooo
Ugh - fuck that orange assclown
There are going to be some really stupid comments in here because of this I can't wait to read them.
what the fuck is this
Fuck this guy. We hate everything Orange. 
Oh what the fuck
no wonder security was so tight. He is on the field before kick...
Please rise for the GEOTUS!
Lol well now I hope everyone kneels during the anthem...
8:17
ITS LIT
listen to those cheers USA USA <3
The fuck am I watching? What's this walking carrot in a suit?
It''s crazy how sec has two teams in the championship game but weren''t the best division in football 
Right?
YOU GET JAIL. YOU GET JAIL. YOU GET JAIL. 
I really don't care about all of your political views.
The App and the website have sucked balls for a long ass time.  I can't remember the last time it actually worked well where it didn't have to buffer like once a minute.  So pathetic...
I think there were just as many boos and jeers as cheers.  Then the boos got louder.He looks so bored to be there.
I guess that explains the security holdup 
Booooooooo
It must cool for a bunch of college kids to meet the President
i do not like the “university” of georgia 
I feel so bad for those ROTC kids
Uhh
Who ordered the clown?
Is the stadium empty, or are they all wearing red?
Those hands are so tiny. 
Of all the times for Charter Spectrum''s verification servers to fail...
Woof
If I wanted to watch two teams from the same conference play I''d watch it during the regular season.
This live comment thing on mobile is tripping me out hahha 
get off the field you fucking jackassdo you really have to make everything about you?
[removed]
Didn''t expect to hear that many prevalent boos. 
wow, a surprisingly mixed crowd reaction
I was saying "Boo-urns"
Lmfao get this orange monkey out of here 
Gonna have to have a pre game thread.
What. The. Fuck. 
Oh god, I don't want to sort comments by new right now. 
ROLL TIDE! /throws up
Shouldn't he be tweeting right now?
Hopefully all the people that said that they aren't going to watch will follow through on that pledge so the espn ps4 app works
Ewwwwwwwwwwwwwww
8:17 EST
Not even in the SEC is DJT cheered unanimously. 
That's a lot of boos with a few cheers. Maybe 35% cheers. But the rasmussen index will have it closer to 47%.
Lol the boos
Still piping in crowd noise I see. 
Boooo-urns 
boo
Apparently the "Championship" game is on tonight.  It's weird, because I thought I watched it on January 1st.
booooo....booo this man
BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
BOO THIS MAN
Dear lord... this game going full hate mode
Are they booing? I have the tv muted. 
[deleted]
If I boo through the TV will he hear me?
George Washington never went to the CFP championship game.Checkmate.
The dawgs got my support today. Go get em.
The things I would do for a meteor strike 
[deleted]
BOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Security is super tight, Any place the president shows up just got 10 times the security it usually does.
I''m sure the appearance of this man will end in zero controversies on this shitposting football website
What's the over/under on controversial comments not about Georgia and Alabama now?
[deleted]
lot more booing than I expected.
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=CC9dkyBPZu0
I'm only 31, and can confirm. Especially since my kids were born have the days just continued to accelerate by. It's crazy. 
I might!
Oh god. He keeps fucking up their pacing
Nvm just forgot this is a stadium half full of Bama fans
The only person to get as mixed of a reaction is John Cena.
Well, I might as well refresh my drank.
Love the boos
Will there be a game thread for the Le Batard show broadcast?
Can anyone tell me how long until kickoff? Wife is on my ass about doing something but I don't want to miss actual game.
BUild the wall! Build the wall!
Fucking Reddit is about to have a field day blaming Trump for shit
nah, that's fucking boring 
That is an unfortunate fitting suit.
What the hell is he doing there.
I was hoping Trump would be singing 
WHO'S THAT COMIN' DOWN THE TRA...dammit its him
BOOOOOOOOO
DONALDS HANDS ARE.BIGGER THAN ALL OF THOSE GUYS HANDS
Trump looks like a caricature of himself
That''s a lot of boos 
Mr. Tiny Hands himself
This network is not included in your current television subscription. **PLEASE CONTACT YOUR PROVIDER TO UPGRADE**feelsbadman
Thats a pretty 50/50 split on cheers and boos
That SEC welcome for POTUS
Holy shit, somebody kneel!!!!
That''s a lot more cheering for trump than I expected 
Fucking Deal with it!!
How could it be so bad
Whoa hey it''s the President!
I didn't hear enough.
Oh ffs
HE''S REALLY SMART. HE SAID SO HIMSELF 
Everyone kneel please
BOOOOO
Surprising amount of boos.
Ew...
Maybe they are hinting at an ncaa comeback. At least I can hope.
I think
[removed]
[removed]
At least he won't be speaking... I hope
What are they booing exactly 
The ROTC kids taking a knee would make people's heads explode. 
Boooooo this man
I really despise the CFP theme. It''s just screaming trumpet holding a single note and a bass line.
Aw that was cringy 
A little column a. A little column b. 
What's the good word?Wait, this isn't Jeopardy. 
Not gonna lie, I wanna see players kneel just for the ensuing shitstorm.
Boo that guy! Boooo!
Booooooo
He just can't not be the center of attention.
you know ESPN id love to watch your presentation legally but your stream is dogshit.
Damn that was actually a lot of cheers
yikes
Can water start dripping on him now
lol Oh god
Gracias
The boos
Lmao the boos 
I'm conflicted. I hate Bama, but Pruit getting another natty would help us with recruiting. So do I stick with my hatred of Bama or do I swallow that hate and bite the bullet for the school and hope Bama wins? 
Why do you hate my liver so much?
Lol the boos
The hold up just walked on to the field. 
He'd only pull this shit in the south.
President is there. Door security is extremely tight right now 
got to make it all about him as usual 
Really...
This is in Georgia. He''s a demigod in this part of the country 
When you're getting a reaction like that from a Georgia/Alabama crowd, you know you're a fuck up.
Should have used the noise dampeners they used at the DNC
If donald took a knee id lose it
That was a really neat mix of boos and cheers 
Really? I read shocked there was audible cheering
Rip any chance at a civil thread
Can't get anymore SEC than this...
My poor boyfriend. He and his dad got there 2 hours early and still haven't gotten in.
Gross
Beer lines are long.
well that won't be controversial
who invited this guy tf
Lol at the booing 
Was that a cheer or a boo? lol
And then they all look outside to see a white bronco pull up to the house
Well it is in Georgia
Everyone denying the trip to the white house so the white house coming to you this year
lol has he ever watched cfb before
who
It's at 8:17
Yes. Source I did the same.
Probs cuz tickets cost 2k each
[removed]
Hooooh boy... *boos as well*
Was it mostly cheers or mostly boos?
This is the time to buy beer 
Fuck this dude, dampening an otherwise thrilling sporting event.
I think half of those people are saying "boourns"
We don't need your orange stank ass mucking up our game. Keep your politics out of football.
Everyone in Athens just started booing.  Yep, the liberal blue dot....
Then, 45 should've stayed his ass at home.
That's some Gary Bettman shit
Well, this is a mixed reaction.
No, because they agree with politics there.
damn I''m agreeing with a UM fan for once 
Sooo the 2 center snares couldn''t play cleanly together...... Lololol 
Oh lord I just want the players to kneel so fucking bad. 
I think they muted the crowd mics to mask any booing
Let's go Dawgs!!!
Lmao 
Can we plox not have politics in this thread y'all
Of course he shows up for Bama and Georgia
[deleted]
Oh my god that marching while attempting to stay in cadence with the president was too much for a retired army guy like me..
Can we not do politics here y''all?
[deleted]
I'm this instance I think it's right field
When is the last time a u.s. president went to a big game like this?
Did not expect to see Trump lol
Didn't know Trump was gonna be there 
Orange you kidding me?!
Who thought this was a good idea lol
he couldn't walk backwards and wave at the same time
boo
lol never seen so many boos for the POTUS 
I think it's rude that Georgia Tech fans aren't pulling for Georgia.Cmon guys if Tech could even make a bowl I would have cheered for yall.
Hopefully he was ejected before he puked in the stands
That is a lot of boos for the deep south.
boos and cheers I think
Don't watch then
[Um, well, the thing is, stuff happened and uh....](https://media.giphy.com/media/bVIKun8dG0YU/giphy.gif)
This thread just got salty af
The crowd like zac brown more than the president lol
Is ESPN doing different coverage on all their channels? Which one is the best?
I don't want to get political, but the boos and cheers seemed almost entirely equal. It was kind of impressive 
Tainted an otherwise beautiful event. 
Why the fuck are the stands empty lol 
Just remember that no matter what happens here, it''s all a farce as UCF are the real national champions
Saban should get a 69 yard penalty for grabbing refs' asses
that's mr. stable genius to you!
$50 to the person who takes a knee.
There goes that man!
Welcome to the Northwestern Mutual Pre-Pre-Game Blitz where we analyze and predict what the ESPN A team will analyze and predict in the H&R Block pregame show.
God damn it. He has ruined this thread. Cue politically motivated voting.
Risky 
Bama and Georgia fans.
I would love to see someone kneel right now
Egotistical Ass
yeah, you need to have AT LEAST a couple more in you by this point
Basically everyone there is from the south 
Hard to find 70,000 people willing to pay $1,300 for nose bleed seats.
5ish minutes
Lot of cheers for the big man!!!
Hes fucking waving and self aggrandizing as usual while the rotc guys are just trying to march.
Anytime they mention Alabama deserved to get in drink  Anytime they mention SEC has two people in drink  Anytime they mention Sabans former assistants are winless again Saban drink  Anytime they talk about someones deceptive speed drink
The backwards ass fans do
Seriously?
Lmao RIP mods.
This won't be controversial at all. 
the boos 
Boo boo!
Can we just play football
Officially, 7 mins.
SO YUGE
I really don''t want to read Twitter right now 
This is the most Southern event ever.
yessssssss
It is the South.
[removed]
LESS POLITICS MOAR FOOTBALL
I can''t believe the clown is actually there. What the actual shit. 
That was extremely weird.
boos > cheers in the south. LOL This fucking clown
Nevertheless, still far too many cheers.
Wow.Interesting reception.
When Zach brown band gets a bigger applause than the president...
I don't like any orange cfb teams or politicians 
Dude don't make fun of those military memebers' hands.
What's the difference?
Nationalism.
LOL Trumps getting booed in Georgia ....
How to kneel on reddit?
Thats one bad hombre.
Fuck this asshole.
How do you tell? Just curious 
What the hell is going on. The super bowl isn''t for another month
Not surprising, though. It is a Georgia vs. Alabama football game.
Starting at the end?  Let's see if it pays off for them
I'd rather cheer for Minnesota and Alabama for the rest of my life than that orange fucker. Fuck him.
Yo, let's talk about some football, eh?
BOO THIS MAN
ZBB way more over than DJT
Man they went full Georgia for this game...
Because Murica. I mean, we fetishize war in the same way that we do with athletes and celebrities, so it sort of makes sense. 
Hear hear!
Holy shit the jeers are loud as hell.
That was like a WWE entrance for the president
I have literally never heard a Zac Brown Band song. Am I a bad southerner?
BOO THIS MOTHERFUCKER
You aren't kidding. Thus stream blows
Me too
I imagine the additional security from POTUS is fucking things up.
Espn's streaming is the absolute worst of any network. Ugghhh
Kendrick is doing the half time show right.
Fucking hell why do we need this shit show of a person here
No see this is different somehow
zack brown band looks a lot blacker than I remember
Nice amount of boo's
[removed]
You mean standing ovation and loud cheering, right?
Totally thought the zac brown band was just one guy...
This is an INSANE introduction
It blows my mind how bad it is. It's almost comical, if it wasn't so infuriating
Jesus is that a negative reaction. In the south no less.
Everyone boo the Zac Brown Band
Little of both.
Zac Brown Band gets a bigger round of applause than the POTUS
Booo this man!
Mixed
ESPN catering to their audience starting with the national anthem
Zach Brown Band > The president
I have NEVER seen Zac Brown without a hat on.
Booo that man
No, no you don't.
Rich Bama and UGA fans. I''m pretty surprised. 
Based
Yeah it's way too fast, about to have a seizure lol.
That was a John Cena level reaction 
I was not expecting that. 
ITT...yeah I'm not going there
I can't wait for President Winfrey to restore some class to the CFP Championship.  
everyone take a knee. and do a shot
"All SEC championship? I'm there"
7:17 Central time 
Minority population 
Eh a decent amount of cheering but also a pretty good amount of booing. Seemed about 50/50.
College football is so fuckin country 
Needs 8 people just to show him where to walk.
Lock it down boys haha
Lots of boos too
It's nice to see our President at the national championship game. :)
Im kneeling in my living room fuck it
Does he know the fuckin words lmao 
lmao
Boo-urns?
He doesn't know the words! LMAO
I just pictured the assclown in chief deciding he can sing the anthem better than anyone else and taking over, that would be marvelous
Yes! Love it
Smart and stable
Nothing but respect baby, honor the flag and those who died for it
A preview for game time
No
"What if they boo?""Sounds like a job for cancer boy.""Nah. Too obvious.""Junior OTC?""Give this man a raise."
BOOOOO
Wait that might actually be why
Does he even know the words 
SAD HE DOESN'T EVEN SING
This is such a Southern championship game. Church choir even. 
He doesn't even know the words
He doesn't know the words to the fuckin anthem haha
hey is that the very stable genius
Can Donald sing the national anthem?
Does he even know the words to the anthem?
I was thinking the same thing. 
Our fuck ass president caused the gates the closed for an hour.
me too man
Man I would die if a player chose to kneel during the game
Of course. Smh.
BOO THIS MAN
I don't like the Aaron Hernandez Department of Murder at Gainesville Community College and Assisted Living Community. 
Probably the only match-up where the boos wouldn't be deafening.
Can't even place his hand over his heart correctly, haha
Right?
Sounded about half and half haha
From Atlanta? They're blue as fuck
This is the weirdest Impractical Jokers skit ever
Nice of them to dress up
get that son of a bitch off the field!
Team meteor just gained a bunch of fans
did you see the hand on that chest?! HUGE
Good 
I concur
Atheist here, that's rude. 
Were they boos or cheers? Can't tell
WOOF WOOF IMA DAWG MOTHAFUCKA
That's my President 
I'd say we shouldn't talk politics in the football thread, but since we've got another half hour til the game starts, might as well
we got the biggest flags don't we folks
watching SkyCam...thought the mix of cheers and boos was one team coming out...
that's a huge fucking flag jeez
Just make sure that idiot doesn't get his hands on a mic.
I wouldn't have
I really love reddit politics /s
Yes
Here's to a good game everyone.  Georgia, you've always been my favorite East team and I love Kirby.  I hope we win but I'm happy for yall's success regardless.
HE DOESN'T KNOW THE FUCKIN WORDS OH MY GOD
Is anyone taking a knee! Zoom in! I came here for the knees! 
*Takes a knee*
anyone know how much it costs to make the CFP trophy?
Why would you ever want to read Twitter? 
prez looking like he's packed on some holiday pounds 
Something tells me that was the point. 
he just had to have a grand entrance didnt he. 
He doesn''t know the fucking words. Jesus Christ. 
People can't get in because of Trump. (seriously.)
that's racist
The background singers sang the intro to the national anthem in a different key than Zac Brown started singing in.Awkward.
He's not even singing the fuckin song lmao
Like really smart
he needs to make it all about himself as usual  
Yo why''s Kendrick not singing the anthem
Is the image quality supposed to be this bad? Everything looks jaggy as fuck
That's my President :') 2020, 4 more years!!!!
Neither did Lincoln
Burn your future career to send a message? Worth it. 
If it really were, both Alabama and Georgia would lose. 
The ol' WWE maneuver  
[removed]
Was that the president or Roman Reigns?
I thought networks were supposed to cut away when an idiot gets out on the field? 
Gross.
Sec is the largest market
Mods about to be busy.
And the president doesn''t know the words to the banner. Lol 
dude is rocking a vest with the chain out
id rather have the choir singing the main part the white guys suck
That''s what I thought too
Your point?
BTW if the stadium looks empty, it's because the lines outside of the Mercedes-Benz stadium are ridiculous I'm reading. A lot of people are going to miss the kickoff.
Tuck Frump
I don''t know what to do with my hands. Also my face is numb. This is more stressful than my child being born.
Watch ESPN is skipping every 10 seconds.
They''re really trying to make this more like the Super Bowl, aren''t they?
Imagine if he had knelt LMAO
lol he doesn't even know the words to the national anthem, lovely.
Our freaking president does not know the lyrics to the national anthem...
That's the worst barbershop quartet I've ever seen.
Why defile the sport with this guy? 
So this is what the South is doing to counter Hollywood from last night 
Seriously, if you can't get this group to like you and the band gets a better cheer than the president.
He didn''t even know the fucking words 
Hold on does our president not know they words to the anthem? Or does he just not want lip sync along?
Lol so much political butthurt. Jesus people
I would like to add another $100
Yes
Comments Are moving so fast I can''t even read them 
Play some colder weather bby
Americans mother fucker.
But ABC is ESPN
Do you think he knows all the words?
not the strongest vocalists
Well, they tried...
Calm down bud...
/r/politics on suicide watch
Can we just get to the game? All of this patriotic bullshit is completely unnecessary.
Thanks my man
I forgot how much I liked Zac Brown Band
Donald doesn''t even know the words 
Bernie woulda won! /sI felt obligated since it's Reddit.
No I think it was put out that he would show up 
We all know what country we're in, no need for nationalism before literally every single sports event
KNIGHTWow nobody even did it how lame
lil jon 2020
He got that “Let''s go Cena! Cena sucks!” 50/50 chant. 
But they didn''t play this regular season.Ooh Got''em
And as if college football didn''t divide my family enough, everything is now political in this household. Cool.
700 comments in like 4 minutes lmao
THE ZAC BROWN BAND? Was Limp Bizkit unavailable?
I bet Donald only agreed to come after knowing that the two teams were Bama and Georgia.
I just took a knee 
That's a good question. 
uhhhhh, ok
Time to spread the truth brother!
gotta pander to the states that got you in office.  nice!  if this was USC vs virginia tech he wouldn't be there.  
Now there''s something both Alabama and Georgia fans can agree on. 
Lead singer is Zac Brown. Understandable mistake though. They''re really good though.
Not even chicken fried?
hate to be political but he strikes me as the kinda guy who looks down upon college athletes, like a lot of pro fans do
it's kanye right? that should make it interesting 
Yea, maybe a bit much. 
Fuck the haters. 
I don't think he knows the words
Bullshit
That is insane and I love it
Boos, you could even hear them turn down the crowd mics during it
You won't get one more year, that piece of shit. 
Wish it were Washington vs Ohio State or something like that. That''d be fun to see.
You have 10 mins or so.
A lot of column b.
So I shouldn't bet my mortgage on this prop bet?
Wow, this Army propaganda on the screens.For fuck's sake...
They have snipers looking at people right now and they don''t even know it in the stadium!!!!
It would be glorious 
Who invited the orange hair asshole to the watch party?
Fucking based
Zac Brown looks like Will Sasso wearing a fake beard
Doesn't go to Army-Navy game but goes to national Championship...
Game thread about to get locked before kick off... lol.
[removed]
Outside maybe an occasional Army/Navy game can anyone remember a president actually taking part in the presenting of the colors? That just seems really odd to me.
Do you think he knows all the words?
And then there''s Kendrick Lamar lol.
If you ever listened to the radio in 2008, you heard Chicken Fried by them.
Maybe folks are still getting their beer or whatever. Did look pretty empty, though.  
There was a ton of booing dude 
haha, i was surprised that there were as many boos as cheers. i would've expected a warmer welcome.
I thought we were supposed to take the politics out of sports?????
Every party has to have a clown.
Zac Brown band; it gets WORSE?
I approve of the Zach Brown Band's performance. 
One of the worst anthem renditions I've ever heard. These guys get paid to sing?
Roman Reigns went to Tech so he prob wouldnt come to this game 
Pretty great anthem tbh
You were probably hearing both the mic on the camera and the echo from the mics in the stadium
YOU GET A NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP, YOU GET A NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP, EVERYONE GETS A NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP
The man cannot keep a rhythm
Hey is anyone else having trouble with the ESPN app? We can''t get it to play 
I don''t think Donald even knows the words. 
Similarly, it's much better through DirecTV now if that's your provider, at least on my fire stick
He doesnt know the words
LETS TALK ABOUT FOOTBALL STUFF
Country singer getting applauded more than the POTUS. Classic.
Something something politics
Live comments are cool
Y'all, this is the last college football game of the year. It's been a pleasure....WHAT WILL I DO WITH MY LIFE NOW??!!!
this is a pretty cool anthem not gonna liedonald gonna take responsibility for this later lmao
The National Anthem was a hot mess.
Hahaha
Pretty wild that it could he when you think about it 
This is the most fucking Southern thing I've ever witnessed
[removed]
Has any other president ever been to a national title game like this?
I dare someone to kneel with god himself there
Yeah but they're Georgia boys.
Have you ever watched a football game?
I don't.  Killing is wrong, so those who sign up to join the government's killing club get no sympathy from me.
Well that was a surprise
Well it's the heartland of his base... probably figured it out was an easy photo op.Too bad (fortunately?) the boos will be the story. 
If I knew the president got free tickets then I would have ran myself
Holy comment overflow 
They used too much money on the animations earlier
Nah I saw it reported on Friday I think?
Think he knows the words?
Honestly, pretty damn good rendition.
Get politics out of sports?
The roof is pretty dope
It's weird, but probably because it's the anthem. He's said in interviews that he gets colds very easily and likes to keep his head and ears covered. 
No we have to trot out some politicians and bullshit.
He doesn't know it. 
LOL HE DOESNT KNOW THE WORDS
https://twitter.com/freddurst/status/950039581583335424
He''s a stable genius!
: )
[removed]
I''d kill for USC to be here
This is fucking ridiculous lol.  Lets just play football
Super crisp where i am sitting.  
But you gotta love america or you are a commie
Full meltdown of all media at that point
I don't understand. I could have sworn I watched Rose Bowl and Sugar on WatchESPN
cluckluckcluckcluckcluck
Poor mods 
By Alabama fans nonetheless. 
Absolutely not, no.
That choir is dope.
lol, he only knows a quarter of the words to the national anthem.
testing to see if im banned yet or not... 
And this became political. Come on guys we all have different opinions. Not the place. 
All I'm waiting for
Zac is based in Atlanta.  Also they're a huge act. 
Atlanta hates his guts.
No
That was a nice rendition of the anthem at least
should have just let the backup singers take the lead
Well, he is in Georgia with Alabama visiting. So, this is his base. 
half time broseph
Actually 49% cheered for him. But he still wins because of the electoral cheering.
If you're streaming, welcome to the suck.
I hate him, but I heard cheers and USA! USA!
Wish they had stuck with the choir
very stable and smart donald doesn't know the words to the national anthemabsolutely brilliant. a genius.
Me 5 mins ago. "I love college football it brings us together through our mutual hate"me now whelp shit
Where is the kneel cam when you need it???
Nothing like being reminded of politics when you're trying to forget about it for a few fucking hours!
Great national anthem! One of the best ones I've heard in awhile!
Watching this from night class, so only seeing bits. But holy hell Zac Brown without a hat looks weird. 
Why is ESPN  not working!? 
Gotta check on them at halftime
I mean, his approval rating *is* pretty shit
Has a president ever been featured in a championship game like this?
Zac Brown Band is so good, their concerts are awesome!
Roman would get more boos even in the south
Nope! Lol
Now that's how you do a national anthem!
Wow these guys do not sing well
not seeing what you're seeing
[removed]
I didn't know Satan could exist in multiple forms at once. 
Probably not 
That was dope, actually 
it was pretty cool actually lol
Bum Bum buuuhhh
the comments are spicy
O SHIT WADDUP
All I''m saying is...2,300 comments and we just finished the national anthem.
I watch football to get away from politics
Lol mods gonna lock the game thread 
Dude on the far right was possessed by a demon on those last few notes lol
Hi mom
Only good Zac Brown Band song was the one where Chris Cornell did the heavy lifting on vocals.
Holy shit the amount of salty Trump haters here does not disappoint.  Stay mad fellas, that is your President.
[deleted]
Nothing but respect for MY president https://s3media.247sports.com/Uploads/Assets/851/812/4_7812851.jpg
Why couldn't they get Migos to do the anthem? 
Harmonized national anthem. Baller.
Kendrick would have done better
He clearly doesn't.
He went to the Army-Navy game as President-elect in 2016
Welcome to Reddit.
Nope
Wonder how many people who bitch about kneeling are sitting at home right now during this
Gotta shoehorn in the military, rah rah, America fuck yeah! and all that
No
Damn thought CFB was better than this 
All the salt and the game hasn't even started 
Man I love the Zac Brown Band
Lol no. 
@robinlundberg: Really don't feel like watching this game now.
I'm ready for Bama-Clemson III. So nervous.
Rock hard for America currently 
Zac Brown?  Jac Black would have been better
Yeah, it was. 
Lots of barking after the anthem 
Hes not in the 30s for approval for nothing
People smashing their bodies against each other. "beautiful"
Wow, the boos 
No, I don't. 
no
Does? Does he not know the words?
Y'all are crazy there were definitely more cheers than boos. Whether he deserves it is a different story
LEGGO
Is the game not on WatchESPN?
That was trash?
70/30 boos
No.
ZBB is a top tier anthem band. They dont fuck around with the pacing and have some talent. 
A lot of both.
STABLE GENIUS
Kendrick come thru with Blacker the Berry pls
Of all the National Championships they'd bring out and parade the president...*this one?*
C'mon guys don't let a small appearance by a politician ruin a perfectly good same of FOOTBALL!! - John Madden
I love Zac Brown so much that was an amazing anthem
Feels like the right time to say - thank you, mods, for all your hard work.
Doubt it.
The shapes he makes with his mouth are something else
*and the rocket's orange glare*
Lmao the boos. What a bunch of disrespectful fucks.
[deleted]
Yes. 
Scroll down a bit from the top! It stops auto filling and lets you read at your leisure. Source: I was very mad about the same thing and just discovered this. 
The Atlanta Falcons have lost every game that Zac Brown Band performs the Anthem for. Just a fun fact. Which team will be next??
him
Zac Brown band sounds like shit. 
Bernie can still win, match me. 
Think he knows words?
Why was the intro in a different key?
Sounded like mostly cheers to me. We are in the south btw.
4 white guys singing with the black women in the back
I have the mute on.   Who are those four fatass rednecks? 
Yes.
Welcome to the south everybody
That sounded like a louder boo after the anthem than before
Eh, go Tweet about it.
So expected kick-off 9 PM?
Did we know he was gonna be there? Damn i wish i couldve witnessed the reaction hah. I''m surprised 
If my knee was working I would have taken one
Glad they didnt fuck with it, just sing it. Great one tonight
Didn't look like it lol
[removed]
Why not both?
FACT
Does he not know the anthem?
WatchESPN app you are, like, not smart or very stable
Ahahaha they kept the teams in the locker room for the national anthem. Wonder why.
Gimme more chicken fried, less of this. 
[deleted]
>hand over hand
You get a national championship! and you get a national championship, and you get a national championship too, oh and you over there?  You get a national championship too!  
I'm probably in the minority but I love all the fanfare
That anthem was ass
Yes
Now to go put the giant flag on the ground
[removed]
The Zac Brown band needs to be punched in their collective throats.  For America.
We've replaced left shark with uncomfortable right soldier.
H8  FEEDS THE DAWGS
Let's go Bama!
Either my tv is broken or these dudes are way off key
Lol at all the angry comments about the President being shown
If Alabama wins: it''s because of Pruitt If Georgia wins: it''s because of Sherrer #facts 
Zac Brown band actually makes some pretty great country music... every genre has great artists...
Zac Brown Band was flat as hell. Would''ve preferred to have just heard the choir sing. 
Omg
Lol doesn't look like it.
Is my TV off or did it look like Georgia was wearing pink?
Gucci Mane shoulda had the anthem
Can we get a natural disaster flair?
Fuck do I really hate the whole "Military and sporting events" trope. 
Was it just me or did most of the crowd boo after the anthem?
Lmao it's fucking hilarious that they booed him
Someone pls kneel lol 
Prooooobably not.
Fuck watch espn this is awful 
I'll take it. Roll Tide
That was a pretty swell version of the Natty.
Zac Brown Band actually killed it IMO
lmao he doesn''t know the anthem
LOL. He's really singing the anthem.
Dude's a former angel, shouldn't be shocked. According to the lore, at least.
Dude can't even stand still. 
Everything is so Georgia right now.
WHICH STREAM DO I WATCH!!!!!!!!!!!!!?????!!!!
Yeah, caught me off guard
What's wrong with Zac Brown Band?
My boy Nixon pronounced us national champs
I guess not, SAD
Jim Chaney? Now there's a name I haven't heard in a while 
The south
Why are people freaking out he's there? It's a big time game. Who gives a shit
I know this is a joke but come on dude he obviously can
It is Georgia v Alabama. 
Not if you follow the news
Wrong!
Hunker down you hairy dawgs.
**BOO HIM**
[removed]
Totally agree - more toes in the water ass in the sand, am i right?
Has any other president been this self important? 
I could have done without some of the background singers with their counterpoint. 
So are they a country boy band then?
MURICA
[removed]
Wish it had been louder.
C I V I L T H R E A DIVILTHREAD
I don''t get why ESPN mobile restricts games like this and the NFL other than to piss me off
... Pacific
College doesn''t come on the field. It''s an NFL marketing thing 
And have it be a big thing on the field? I don't ever remember this being a thing
Is it bad I wanted Goldbergs music to hit when UGA came out of the locker room?
So many boos... pretty weird
way more boos!ZBB got a bigger pop than Trump did.
Maybe if you were listening you would know.
Too busy livin' it up not givin' a fuck.
I thought maybe the same thing. I heard cheers.
I just want a good game and no more friggin injuries!
[deleted]
Yeah that was known ahead of time. 
I see you
Politics aside the stadium roof looked cool af during the banner 
Can anyone remember when a President walked onto a football field for a game?
For real though 
For real haha. This is what we get for an all SEC championship
it's on like 75 different feeds
Except their experience will always have the asterisk of it being that President.
That definitely felt... southern
Shocked you haven't heard Chicken Fried at least. Or Knee Deep. So yes, you are.
[removed]
it's Alabama vs Georgia... In Georgia
Alright, let's talk about some football.
Thanks for not starting at 7 ESPN! Gave me enough time to do the dishes!
Free trial sling tv or YouTube TV.
Why would Herschel Walker care if they kneeled? 
Kirby may be Smart but is he like really smart?
Got a bigger cheer than Donnie
Those USA USA USA chants!
Damn Fowler and Herbstreit completely avoided mentioning him lmao 
Which stream should I watch?
Sounded bad to me too.
he's a genius, he knows *all* the words 
Kendrick's halftime show is about to be LIT now. 
Just one year away!!!
I heard some boos but I heard a lot more whistles.
[removed]
lol at all the boos
Is it true that trump is only giving one interview - to some Alabama affiliate? No ESPN interviews?
Clown in Chief
Because they blow.
Is this the first time Bama has worn white in a Saban title game?
Man i never thought I''d say this, but I wish it was UW and Cal in the championship, that guy wouldn''t wait until after the anthem to throw fit on Twitter from their boos. 
[removed]
He''s a stable genius, of course he knows it. Probably. 
Dawg hungry. 
But he is a genius! Surely he knows the words.
Dude, binge "The Foundation" album after the game. It's good shit.
thank god, haha. too important of a game and its not even kickoff yet
I thought it was one of the better renditions. I hate it when it gets glass shattering screatchy. 
I thought it was pretty good, Zac Brown Band kicks ass
That was a lot.
[removed]
Yeah, it's been consistently terrible for a while now.
security lines holdup
Can we please play football and skip all of the forced patriotism?
Great rendition of the national anthem imo.
Yeah, I sure he tweeted about it and the news said something about it
Seemed like he knew the end part that everyone knows but not the verses. 
I had to switch to the directv now app
I love their music. If you haven''t heard their new stuff, they did a different style of music under the name Sir Rosevelt. You should check it out.
I'm going off of the coaches room atm, I've heard good things about itESPN news I believe
First off how dare you. Second off.....how dare you?
AMERICA
Idk about the field tbh
This thread went from very quiet to super noisy.  Can everyone shut up so my jokes get the appreciation they deserve?  thanks.
Can confirm :(
Bye errbody. I don't have the nerves to watch both the game and the thread.EDIT: One more thing. **FUCK BAMA**
[removed]
Fuck him and his supporters. 
Are you getting the ‘unable to play video'' text on every channel too?
Because fuck him
It's almost like that's the only reason they came to the sub
Why is the stadium so empty?
I'm in the military and I hate it.  Not necessary.
I rewound, sounded like a mix. 
Yup, sounded like four guys singing the national anthem at the same time. No pleasant harmonies to be found.
[removed]
I've never been more ready for anything 
Gerald Ford
The comments are flowing in so fast it''s giving me epilepsy
Try streaming? Maybe r/cfbstreams
they were fuckin great
Short answer: NoLong answer: Noooooooooooope 
Those weren''t boos you dopes.
You think his senile ass remembers the words to it? 
Lol at Aaron Murray being anywhere near the best to wear a Georgia uniform. 
Was it me, or did one of those singers resemble Zach Galifianakis?
holy shit did that audience ovation sound artificial.  i'm sure it was due to a guy behind a sound board not mixing it well, but, it was really not well engineered.
Of course not. 
To the song? Or just in general?Then the answer is yes.
why tho
I'm pretty sure UCF is my president at this point
It''s not being shown i have a problem with it''s making it about himself. Jimmy Carter was at a championship game with Georgia and he sat in the stands and didn''t make a scene of his presence 
I'm actually nauseous now guys.      In all sincerity, great season so far Bama. Hope it's a clean game and they let our boys play ball! Go Dawgs, hunker down one more time!!!  
Damn, that's a beautiful anthem, ZBB!
Well, I'm glad watch ESPN has made this unwatchable. Great. 
uproot
@PeteThamel: Donald Trump will be watching the game from the visiting owner''s box. This will impact the elevator to the Bama coach''s box.
I had to leave the room for that 
We're wearing white, history is on our side yeyeyeye
LETS GO DOGS
Shiny with all the water
you could see the "naa naaa naaa naaa" mumbling everyone does when they don't know the words lol
I think they did pretty well
And fuck you too
I shouldn't have turned down those cue cards...Uggghhh...-Krusty the Clown
So Trump's gonna be out there for Kendrick's performance too, right?
Clearly u need to get your hearing checked then
Yo why didn't Georgia do a blackout. Thatve been cool
some poor fucker had to paint all that shit
Watch ESPN had its code written by university of iowa students.
I bet his dumb ass doesnt even know the most basic cfb memes
Words? I don't think he knows where he even is.
Lol I like how he shit talks NFL players for protesting and then shows up here. Like these kids don't face the same issues and hold similiar beliefs.
I heard that the lines were so bad outside the stadium it was taking people an hour to get inside
even when it plays, you have to constantly refresh, as it will cut out to buffering 1000's of times during this game. 
Yep, now I can see why.Same thing happened when Pence came to the Colts game.
It''s not that I think other countries have bad national anthems, I just think they''re not as good
I REALLY HOPE WE CAN LEAVE THE POLITICS BEHIND. THIS SUB IS BETTER WITHOUT THE COMMENTS FROM EITHER SIDE. 
LOL Where are those "keep dem dere politics out muh footballl" when a player takes a knee folks at? Glad I didn't have to serve under that dude.
[removed]
Ya that was bad
Trump and K-Dot at the same function lol
LETS GO DONALDDONALD SUCKS
Presidents don''t traditionally go to the National Championship game.  When I heard he was going to be there, I thought it was interesting
It''s your tv
He went to the Army Navy game last year. No president has attended it every year. 
You misspelled "Civil War."
I'm not surprised, a lot of people (me included) hate him.
UGA won in 1942 and 1980. 38 years between. GUESS HOW MANY YEARS BETWEEN 1980 AND 2018.  Go Dawgs!
Roll tide
Holy fuck here we go 
Zac Brown band
OP was just trying to be edgy.
Did they make the players stay in the locker room so they couldn't protest? lol
Did you guys not wear white two years ago?
Looks to be about the same as last weekend 
Well, that was certainly weird
Maybe first pitch at a football/baseball field?
Yep i think so 
nah this ain't r/[deleted]
Everybody, brace yourself for twice more commercials than actual game.
Saban doing some weird voodoo chants rn 
[removed]
Lol freedom of speech.
Doubt it. Probably been spotted in the crowd and that's about it. That's Don for ya.
They always do that in college games do they not? I know they do at Kentucky home games
Let''s fucking go 
I'm gonna go against the prevailing opinion, but I enjoyed the anthem. 
As they say in hockeyLet's do that Hockey
Came for football. Disappointed by politics.
uniforms for both teams on point. This will be a close game
During the anthem I act the same way at home as I do at the stadium.  With my hand on my dick, redditing.
[removed]
lol @ people applauding the boos when you could only hear cheering on TV
[Saban right now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zopk5af9_yg)
My body is ready. Let''s get this going. 
Security is really tight bc of POTUS
[removed]
lawl, LEAVE THE TEAMS IN THE LOCKER ROOMS! NO KNEELING WITH THE PRESIDENT OUT THERE!
How is the Watch ESPN app SO DAMN BAD
Everyone in here circlejerking over how much they dislike Donald is hilarious. 
Oh god its happening
Most college games the teams aren''t on the field for the anthem 
Nope. 
In '87 they did an interview at half time  with Reagan during the Penn State - Miami Fiesta Bowl, which ended up making PSU the National champions. 
Lovely comments in here. 
MORE BUSINESS LIKE
Think they were white vs us in 2012/2013
They wore white in Clemson - Bama I
Because they have done that for the past few years. 
I mean it is Georgia
Zach Brown Band. One of the more tolerable pop country music bands. A few songs are, I dare say, even enjoyable. 
I'm laughing so hard 
Bama is shook
They did a good job however people will hate me and scoff but Sara Diamond always knocks it out because like these guys she just sings it and does not put a spin on it.
Bold Prediction: The Cleveland Browns won't get another loss this evening.
BUSINESSLIKE
I kinda want to get let back into the country on Thursday so will refrain from saying anything about the Supreme Leader
I just asked my dog if he was cheering for the Dawgs and he seemed pretty excited about the question so you got that going for you UGA 
Nick Saban standing there like a soccer mom while his team gets hyped behind him
LOL I said the same thing. It was four guys randomly singing, one louder than the others. 
Ahh cool. A Michigan game, probably.
I'm picturing a Spinal Tap moment where Alabama just keeps wandering the halls and can't find the entrance. 
The ultimate No-Win scenario for Auburn fans.
Why can''t everyone do anthems like that. Don''t need some ridiculous artistic version or guitar solo
So much coaching talent in that little man
This would be the greatest timeline
Thanks.  
I'm at a bar in Santa Fe and nobody is here to watch the game wtf
Oh god that match me shit got on my nerves. And I voted for bernie in the primaries too lol
[deleted]
Georgia is so locked in 
The President attending a game isn't political unless you make it so.
Fits your username
Well the game should start in like an hour or so at this rate 
I thought the team with the away jerseys usually won. You'd probably remember better than I
My fucking nerves right now
UGA, you've pissed me off over the last week with the dumbshit about bringing up how you totes would have done the same to ND as Bama did, because the transitive property totes makes sense in sports (and because Auburn totally did the same thing to you twice in a row this year), but now it's time to play. #BeatBama
So who do Auburn fans root for? My burning question, or is that my heartburn...
does Saban have any emotion even
Agreed, why can't we just watch football without fetishizing the military? 
He wouldn't have the guts to face a stadium full of people from Washington and California, wouldn't even be there.
[removed]
If that was in North Dakota the building would have exploded with cheers 
I love how Kirk is spending so much time telling us how much Bama totally belongs in the playoffs
[deleted]
The red shirts are dope AF tho!
The Mods are on suicide watch for this one.
The last time they blacked out we whooped them
Comcast has a death wish...this is what my Xfinity app says. [Wow](https://m.imgur.com/a/coyx3)

I'm kind of enjoying it tbh. It's almost comical 
Seeing how things are going so far makes me so unafraid of The South ever rising up again.
He's team SEC football/anti NFL... probably shouldn't tell him about the strong relationship with ESPN
I thought it was kendrick lamar
Are they really analyzing how the teams leave the tunnels?
I like that we're getting cfb closer to politics. It'll make Snyder's run in 2020 easier.Snyder/Snyder 2020: Make America Work Hard Again
Does it matter? 
This is a fucking spectacle

[removed]
V v informative answer.
The president imitated and mocked a disabled man among his many disrespectful acts.Respect is earned. 
I''ll take it. Neither of our fan bases are known for being non conservative. 
If I was a fan of either of these teams I'd be so hype right now 
Im only here for kendrick lamar
He wouldn't go.
ITS THE YEAR OF THE MOTHERFUCKING DWAG LETS GO DWAGS!!!!!!!!!!!!
Am I crazy or did Trump not know the lyrics to the anthem?
“Forgot”
That was a lot of booooooooos
Security apparently a major hold up, having the President there only adding to the security screen. 
Lmao
I've never seen it. Like I've seen them be called out for attending but nothing like that.
You can see the game from the concession stand pretty easily. They didn''t do a good job encouraging you to get to your seat before the real stuff. 
LSU fans: drink everytime they mention 1/9/12
They always do that in cfb.
Flair up. 
God I''m excited
Atlanta's not exactly a conservative stronghold, and it's probably a younger-than-average crowd.
Remember when we beat both of these teams...yeah that was nice...*chugs bleach*
Go Dawgs!
Life finds a way.
Holy shit I can''t handle sorting comments by live on the app. My brain. 
Alabama is about to come out to Hell's Bells since the antichrist is their coach...
College players are always in the locker rooms for the anthem
They sure weren't saying booo-urns
sorry, I don't like fascists 
YouTube TV is rocking it.
Saved himself a few more boos
[removed]
Should we go outside and light a couch on fire?
[removed]
Now I'm confused, everything just sounds like Boos
Anyone know what the crowd split in the stadium is?
I can''t keep up
hahaha i was thinking the same thing. 
It looked like he didn''t know the words because the sound in the stadium is not in sync with the audio feed. 
"Georgia appears more business-like" I half expected to look up and see the whole Georgia team in suits and holding briefcases haha
And 10x more lagging on WatchESPN
*actual game ...presented by Dr. Pepper
Thanks to everyone for making this another great season! Now let's enjoy this great game of college football before the dreaded off-season begins.
They normally do in college games anyway
[removed]
[removed]
You picked a really good time to fuck up WatchEspn
Definitely did not seem like it the first time they showed him. I think he knew the "oh say does that Star spangled banner" part, though. 
$1,000 tickets, secondary market mark ups should be illegal 
Agreed
Im switching between this and the bachelor. Im telling ya, Arie needs to be replaced by Danny Devito 
Ok, so we had the sitting president show up to the game. That's cool, now let's play ball
Instant kneel!
Gerald Ford? He was technically a player though
They pay good money for that.
Omg I want dat 
Must be nice for you: Bama not getting the majority of the hate for once.
Hell yes. GO DAWGS! 
I think I'm just going to watch last year's Natty instead.
Not “boy band” at all, but they do lots of harmonizing. They''re real good though and I''d recommend them
IVE BEEN WORKING ON THE RAILROAD
What would we do without Harvard 
I'm ready for that midnight Kendrick Lamar concert
No, he was just only singing the best words from the anthem. The rest of the words arent good words and he only uses the best words.
Almost certainly.
Wife: "Why are they booing Georgia?   I thought this was in Atlanta."
Saban already looks disappointed and the game hasn't even started. He's probably upset with the temperature inside the dome. 
The Dwags?
I'm disappointed that peppers isn't playing.JK CFB REMEMBER THAT MEMEME?
Nixon, re: Texas-Arkansas
yep
Fuck him. 
I realllly don''t think that was the case (i was half kidding bc most of it was a buzz roll)
Does anyone know what channel this game is on? I'M having some trouble finding it. /s 
Holy fuck I hate Watch ESPN. I missed all but like 4 seconds of the anthem because it was buffering so much.
Civility is overrated.  Sometimes incivility is the morally-obligatory mode of engagement.
Their bartender.
>dawgs are actually in the natty it's happening boys 
Smug Saban
But this is for the 2017 season so really only 37 years 
Players are always in the locker room during the anthem in college.
One of them was probably packing heat.
I would be there if that happened!
After the first half how many players will have defected to the BIG10?
I'm pretty hype because I really fucking hate Alabama.
Kickoff is scheduled for 7:20.
Might not seem that way, but the guys not that popular 
So they get a defensive coordinator like Mike Stoops?
These live comments are gonna give me a damn seizure, but fuck it I gotta keep posting
This has been discussed before, it has nothing to do with the protests and has been done for years.
calm down ladies and gents, mods are going to lock the thread
THIS IS THE DAWGGGGGGGG HOUSEEEEE
The organizers of this are fucking cowards. No Kendrick on the field at halftime and no players on the field during the anthem. So scared of any kind of statement.
BOO US. IT FEEDS US.
Wasn't Clemson a number 1?
They lose when they do blackouts
He wouldn't have been there. lol
Yes. It unnecessary every single time.
[removed]
Boooooooo
Sherman's return.
**GIVEM HELL DAWGS**
How do you do it? 
Roll Effin tide
I fully expect this game to go 5+ hours!
Just dont pull an lsu at the 2011 game please 
Because he should be running the country
How can I start up for K dot of the game isn't starting until 9 and I have to be up at 6?
Damn right!!!!!!!!!!!
Watching on tv, heard plenty of boos. 
Looks like we've found Saban's excuse if he loses.
GO GEDDUM DAWGIES!!11!YEEEEHAAWWWWW
Did any players take a knee during the anthem? I just turned the game on. 
don't think so.  Not everywhere, but I know a lot of CFB games players come out after anthem.  Used to be like that in the NFL until about 10 years ago IIRC
I can't tell who is cheering who. I just hear roars
Boos overpowered by pumped-in cheers; it is the Falcons' stadium after all.
What quarter do you think the giant meteor will strike the stadium? I'm thinking 2nd quarter. 
I love dogs. My boxer is my buddy. So, I will cheer for the dog team
Everyone is just screaming 
Well yeah. But people are just pissed off. Like, big deal. Who cares.
Why is there live comments instead of new I can''t even read what anyone is saying
i cant tell whos cheering or booing
No matter what happens tonight, respect to Bama. That's a fucking tradition of excellence.
anger sometimes
Georgia looks like they are just happy to be there and Bama looks like they want to rip peoples heads off.
Actually it never works 
Are they kneeling or praying 
Shit, that run out of the tunnel got me. This is surreal. The Georgia Damn Bulldogs are actually playing for the national championship. 
Can both teams lose?
[So does Propagandhi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAIUf_SYpwE)
Stream it my dude. Cfbstreams
last time we wore black jerseys against Bama we got our asses beat
Hey man, you're in the final! Don't stress, have fun!
UGA could pull off a sweet all-white helmet
So glad I lived long enough to see Alabama in the title game again.
Yeah I really wish people would realize this is a football thread
I've never been to Atlanta. Would like to visit.
Why is thread active? I thought nobody was watching the SEC Championship tonight 
Could not even fill a stadium in your home marketNo wonder Georgia Tech has always been big brother
We don''t have a claim to shit but a peach bowl. 
Sigh.*Pours shot of bleach*
Gotta love when reddit rears its ugly head in a football thread
Saban just looks bored like "Well, here we go again"
The tide should definitely come out to the imperial march. 
My nerves are SHOT fam
I gave up drinking for a year for my new years resolution. What have I done
Well neither QB is going to go to the draft so it is like they aren't winning anything
CFB players are never on the field during the anthem. Used to be like that at NFL games too.
I'm still cool with team meteor hitting the stadium. Take care of a lot of my problems.
barking
So fuck espn already. This is unwatchable.
Literally as I read your comment, my feed died. 
For the anthem?
Alabama is pumped the fuck UP. How is GA so calm right now??
Lets go Bama.aThe only people that remember the losers are the losers and the team that beat the losers. As long as I get to laugh at Georgia by midnight for not winning a title since 1980, I'm good
My prediction: Georgia 21 - Bama 13.  Really just hoping for a good close game though regardless of who wins.
How is Alabama -4 in this game? 
Our tax dollars at work. http://www.post-gazette.com/news/nation/2015/11/06/Department-of-Defense-paid-53-million-to-pro-sports-for-military-tributes-report-says/stories/201511060140
That's poor planning sorry man
me too tbh
[removed]
lol he definitely wouldn't show up. AL/GA was about his best case scenario, same with the Patriots winning the Super Bowl.
Maybe but unless you were deaf that was painful.
There are a whole lot of Georgia fans in MB. 
WOOT WOOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Why don't we just take the top 4 SEC teams next year and that's the playoff?
He has to compete with Dantonio to see who can be the most emotionless
They understand that h8 feeds the Dawg
He isn't going to the super bowl for sure 
The sparklers are a nice touch
YouTube TV free trial.
Pretty even mix, Zach Brown Band got much more applause.
[removed]
Last time they did a blackout against Bama it didn't work out too well for them
Lol I said the same thing. These are piling in so fast I doubt they can keep up 
Yeah, hearing the reaction for Zac Brown was the kicker of how displeased people are.
Nationalism is ridiculous and scary.
ROLLDAMN TIDE
It will be a pleasure shit posting with you tonight.
Seemed half and half to me.  
Don't worry, it will be the largest attended national championship game ever and whomever wins will be because of his rousing appearance.  Edit: when this inevitably happens I will cry.
"It's about 70:30 dawgs fans tonight"Idk maybe because the game is in fucking Georgia?
WoW ItSz EmpTY iN ThERe
I think Saban should leave for the NFL if he wins today. Hear me out, if he wins he will pass Bear Bryant for the most national championships for a coach, and being 65 he may never have another chance. I say go to the NFL and fix the only blemish on your stacked resume.
****YO... MODS.. THIS GAME AIN'T AT THE MERCEDES BENZ SUPERDOME. FIX IT. THERES ONLY 1 SUPERDOME****
Imagine if someone blew out their knee running onto the field 
Fun Fact: Most broadcasts are 11-14mins of true game play.
After we held it horizontally, also against flag code...
I work at a factory, 2nd shift. Brought my lap top down. Currently doing "work" in the cafeteria cuz it has a TV with the game on.
70-30 Georgia 
"...What? THAT'S UCF'S MUSIC! THE KNIGHTS HAVE BROKEN INTO THE BUILDING AND ARE TAKING THE FIELD."
70-30 goddamn
Jesus, this is like a movie.
Go Dawgs
Whenever a team runs out next to flames being shot out, a little part of me is always scared that it''ll tip over and the entire team will get burned to a crisp
I don't trust you. I'm sure the comments are great.
They just estimated 70/30 GA.
3000 comments and not kickoff yet. 
Oh god that attempt at a southern accent
The whole team kneelin goddam
I''m down 
Looks like it's too late for that. Ugh
Omg Saban trying to hide that shit eating grin haha
It didn't sound 70/30 on tv when the teams ran out 
Because he has to make a spectacle instead of just going to his box. Game is about the players not his orange ass 
They are far underrepresented in government
*college* football on Reddit. Take a guess what the average age is here.
I can't even begin to fathom the fucking noise in that stadium lol
Both wear crimson. Rivals wear orange. Oklahoma is new CFBest Friend
As much as I hate Alabama, I love their fight song.
Man i need one of those flamethrowers for my basement
Very conspicuous that neither team was out for the Anthem. I wonder, have teams been kept in the locker room during the anthem in recent previous NCGs?
ESPN's on demand services are so garbage I literally have to resort to shady means in order to watch this.
If I had to go to any SEC (excluding Vanderbilt) school it'd be UGA. Athens seems super beautiful.So, Go Dawgs!
If I was a fan of either of these teams I'd be so ~~hype~~ drunk right now
Yeah I mean I could tell there was *some* booing, but it sounded like a lot more cheering to me
What do you mean? He''ll still be on TV
They had to tell him it was a golf course. 
Probably have no idea 
A bunch of chubby, tattooed white guys who can't sing much less harmonize isn't all that entertaining.
I'd believe that.
It's to be expected when a team has largely dominated the playoffs since its inception. 
Chris Fowler: You don''t need to say “DAWWWWWWGS” with a southern accent.
Team entrances during the championship always get me so fucking hype
Alabama fans must be gripping. If they don't win tonight, it will be like 12 months before they get another chance at a title.
everything is awful
Le Batard had Kenny G do the national anthem and it gave me so much life you guys. Let's do this damn thing.
" the pageantry of college football'
[removed]
The amount of people who film with their flash on is absurd
This is it folks, the fight for silver. 
I've waited on this for years!!! Let's fucking go! 
Stadium seems filled with Alabama fans. 
It''s the NATIONAL Championship 
ESPN app freezing for anyone else? 
Make sure you go to Antico when you do. 
Last time they did they got stomped by Alabama
70-30 dawgs to tide
Thanks to our tax dollars!
Does that make the mark of the Beast a national championship ring?
My box was stuck booting up for like 15 minutes but now it is working!
How would you even know if your TV was off?
Literally like an hour and a half from Athens
Youtube TV is a totally fine product imo. Little expensive
he doesn't know the constitution, so I wouldn't expect him to know the national anthem 
That's how cfb games always are.
YouTube TV 7 day free trial. It's been flawless so far for me.
I hope they let them play. Also hope it's not a PAC-12 crew of refs. 
THE INSTANT KNEE! GO DOGS!
I pay for cable yet I'm looking up illegal streams now, because watch espn is stuttering and stuck in the lowest quality. I have 100mb download speed, but I get on ESPN and it's like I have fucking dial-up. 
i like how they had to keep the teams in the locker rooms for the anthem
I''m at a watch party where someone just said “I hope someone shoots him” so yah, maybe smart. 
Can we pick something less destructive to the stadium though...
Georgia looks nervous
Go Dawgbros!
They always do for CFB games...
I thought so too. 
GLORY GLORY MAN UNITED
I'm at my sister's house which finally has good internet, and ESPN stream is slow as fuck. 
Hey, at least you made it to this one! (I know we got out ass whooped)
...but not watch ESPN?
BEAMER!
Saban emerging from the darkness like Vader at the end of Rogue One.
I feel bad for the mods right now
It is our last college game for 250+ days.  Of course we are going to watch it and spew nonsense.
We got a kneeler!
ROL TIDE AAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH
Usually Georgia fans and Bama fans get along but ya know, subs been toxic lately 
Why the fuck has espn not fixed their steam in literally years? 
I have no reason to hate either of these two teams and yet I hate every single team that's not mine.Except for Iowa, for some reason I like Iowa.
Alabama won. can already tell by their pregame prep 
Your right, I mean since UCF was crowned National Champs already.
Alright this is a football game not a politics pissing contest let''s go
Yes, the storied Central Florida Trojans
Hahahahahahahaha ain''t happening 
#BEAMER
I hate both teams, but HOLY FUCK do I want to be in that stadium right now
how high are your ceilings?
What a snowflake
FRANKYESGOBBLES PROUDLY
Where you at Chuck??
Someone Orange had to show up.
big game in the sec, will have huge national title implications.
Literally just said 70/30
nevermind you right im dumb 
Can't help but hear the Star Wars Imperial March song whenever Bama takes the field
Go Dawgs!!!
If you have a UGA or Bama flair why the fuck are you on Reddit and not at a watch party right now.
Fuck Bama, let's go Dawgs
> Anytime is a good time-WatchESPN
I''m gonna puke.... so nervous...
#GO DAWGS!
to those who hate watchespn, sign up for the free youtubetv trial. its free for 7 days and the stream is smoooooooth
Repping App State? Boom triggered.
Beamer looks great!
Frank has lost weight.
Live comments are unusable. Wish they''d bring sorting by new back. 
THAT'S M'BOY FRANKIE!!!!!!!!
Ah, the Mack Brown band
"Coach Gundy, what are your keys to maintaining a great mullet?"
I've bitched all month but there was never any doubt I would watch
I thought he said duck tease 
Are they going to say Ohio again during the toss?
I don''t hate him. 
[Frank Beamer you say?](https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/7657869/beamer.0.jpeg)
YOU EVEN FUCKED UP VOICES ESPN WTF
Dont bring math into this.
Could you not
Georgia's unis are clean
Trump is someone that would drink all the beers at the party and not have common decency of bringing anything of his own
Pipes freeze? Thawing that fast will actually cause more problems 
ROLL DAWGS TIDE IS HELL!
O/U Hurts 200 passing yards
[removed]
These teams seem really hyped for a game that doesn't mean anything 
YouTube tv just froze for me
Man if I was a player I'd be a huge wreck right about now
My stomach hurts 
#gamedayforFrank
Only Alabama, GT, and Florida fans must be cheering for Alabama , right?
Anybody else already excep their hangover for tomorrow morning? 
STINCH!
You'll be happy either way according to flair 
Might be a security thing since DT was there 
DAWG BRO!
[removed]
I still like him better than Belichick's RBF
Omg. Live comments. This is too much. 
Frank Beamer!!!!!!!
Beamer got skinny and Brown got fat.
Trump and Kendrick Lamar in the same building.Natty too lit. 
Mike Gundy's mullet is magnificent.
As a former Florida State fan, winning 2 championships in 4 years would be a great feeling. 
Of course, what else would it do?
Could you imagine watching this if you were from a different country and had never seen football before?
FRANKKKK
This is so hype
Always
If there was one HC I could gift a NC to, it'd be Mark Dantonio.If there were two HCs, however, the next one would be Beamer. 
FUCK YES. Multiple GA players kneeling? No one from Alabama??
I have the official app so I''m not sure if it works for the third-party apps, but when you go to sort the comments by “best”, etc. it has “Live” and an option instead of new
#MURRAY STATE REPRESENT
There we go. All the Alabama fans in Ralph Lauren shirts and Khaki pants. A true Alabama game.
Man Beamer looks 5-10 years younger. 
If I was an Auburn fan I'd be tearing my eyes out
That shot of the bama players praying was some unexpected rennisance shit
Mack Brown's shoes lmao
Any time I watch a game on the WatchESPN app, it freezes every 30 seconds. Absolutely hate it. 
Has Frank Beamer lost weight? He looks different, in a good way.
Yup, just for that reason I have to go to other places to get a stream of the game that plays better than the legit WatchESPN.  They really need to get their shit together as that website (and App) suck dick.
Keep dreaming 
3k comments before kickoff. We're going to need minute by minute threads, aren't we?
I want Georgia to win because every championship Alabama wins makes me feel more insecure about the 90''s Huskers and Tom Osborne''s dynasty.
Guess I gotta cheer for Bama tonight, as much as it feels wrong
its alright
The Mercedes-Benz stadium is so fucking beautiful
HAHAH hell yeah Georgia
OH Shit Herschell Walker is suited up
I can't wait for him to claim how high the ratings were because of him
LETS GO!!
Woooo!! Frank!!
Will do*
For anybody having streaming issues on espn, try using playstation vue or youtube tv -- each have a 7 day free trial. 
Going to be my first game watching the coaches room 
Idk anything about CFB Im Canadian
App State representing in the title game.  Nice
oh lord that coin toss squad
Frank & Beams!
big ten refs ooooh
Well, lets go Bama! Witness history.
Reddit is quite possibly the saltiest website I''ve ever seen. 
the WatchESPN app is such a god damn potato. Why don't they fix this shit?
Lmao Herschel''s like fuck I gotta catch up to the players lol 
We should have had a first half of the first quarter thread.
If the CFP was still two teams  these two wouldn't be here. If it was improved to 6 teams, hmmm...
I wonder how much it cost the taxpayers for Donald to make an appearance at that game?
34 looks like he could still suit up
Beamer sighting, m0-0n cofirmed.\o/
Georgia brought the big dogs out 
Thank you. I fucking hate the live comments. 
RABBLE RABBLE RABBLE
[removed]
This my escape subreddit from politics. Pls bby. Don't ruin my safe haven
Frank Beamer is lookin'' good! 
OJ HOWARD FIRE THE CANNONS 
I never thought UGA would get this far. NEVER! I think I'm going to lose my lunch. Go Dawgs!
So... We gonna start the game before 8:30? 
Can't risk starting a tweetstorm.
Beamer!
yo beamer sighting might be the highlight of the night for me if this game gets away from georgia lol
The fact that it's pretty much a home game for the Bulldogs just adds another wrinkle to this game. Idk what it is about the NCG but it seems like every one is a legendary game. 
Question: why don''t you support our troops?
Herschel could still play
amped, let's do this thang
UT is prettier tbh
But glad it's working for ya now!
"Alabama fans travel!"*game may not even be triple digit miles from their home*
FOOOOOOOOOTBALLLLLLLLLLL
GuysI put too much mustard in my meatloaf and it''s ruined 
Let's go Dawgs, fuck bama.
WTF are they there for? The Bachelor?
I think most CF games are like that
Herschel trying to catch up lol
Wondering who Auburn fans would cheer for
FOR THE NEXT 4 HOURS, GO DAWGS! REPRESENT MY STATE
Yeah, he quit smoking a few years ago, and along with the stress of not coaching he''s honestly looking a lot healthier
Herschel Walker could still kick your ass. 
Lmao Herschel fell behind
Disagree 
Who doesn't Reddit even at parties?
Hershel suiting up?
# #thatsmycoach
I'm just ready for halftime.
Well, we win the honorary captain battle.
Absolutely. Bowl games and weeks ranked number 1 are nice and all that. Greatness comes from finishing it off though. Bowden used get talked about as one of the greatest coaches ever, and the 14 straight top 5 finishes will never be done again I don''t think, but saban has easily surpassed him because he only won those 2 titles 
These live comments are horrible, wtf it''s so fast I can''t read or respond to anything...
Frank!!
This is just a consolation game...UCF the true National Champs
Whichever toe gets the most upvotes
You lost in the "Florida State Championship Game" already.
HES A MAN 
Think Herschel has any eligibility left?
Are they streaming the game?? 
2 SEC teams
Doesn't every college team do that, every game?
Who would win, a group of the largest living terrestrial animals or one h8ful boi
Bu...but, I'll die...
MY MAN OJ HOWARD GO BUCS
Looked like a prayer
This ain't nothing to us, just business.
Walker still looks like a beast. 
Wow this is fucking epic 
Is every comment saved in the congressional library?
Before Georgia and Alabama face off in this matchup of the two best teams in the country, I'd just like to congratulate the real champions. Only one team can rule the land and that is Imperial Champion Ohio State.  
To be fair he needs at least 3 more championships to summon the portal to the netherworld.
uhhhhh...wut
BEAMZZZZ
If Alabama wins and then the Patriots win the super bowl, there is officially no point to football anymore
Beamz in the Benz
Yes, 100%. His recovery from cancer has been amazing. 
They weren't even on the field yet so no
Ooo, Big Ten refs. So hopefully nothing too fuckery
MY HEART IS BEATING SO FAST
Herschel >>> OJ
Who's starting the counter on Fowler saying 'Daawgs'?
Have you before the last 10 years?
Hershel bout to suit up an play
Herschel Walker: Look kid, gimme the pads and the helmet. I got this"Herschel you're in your 50s!""And I'm in better shape that half the NFL. The pads and the helmet, now"
EVERYONE STOP POSTING SO I CAN READ PLEASE
Can't see Bama take the field through the tunnel without hearing Keith Jackson's voice saying, "And here comes the Crimson Tide of Aaaaa-labama!"
They do in college every game 
Not sure if I like the live feature on mobile lol. So many comments
Walker looks like he still does 1,000 pushups a day.
now someone convince me who to root for
mack brown should join the zach brown band and rename the band the mack brown band 
APP! STATE!
They kept the kids in the locker rooms for a reason...
Oh shit Herschel Walker...
BIIIIIG TEEEEEHHHNNNNN
FRANK!!!!
Is it bad if I feel like rooting for Bama on this one
Herschel and AJ Green have 1 year each of eligibility, right...?
I think they know what refs are bud
Lol no.
Kendrick''s performance is going to be amazing. That''s honestly a main reason I''m here tbh
Let's go Bulldogs!
FUN FACT: Harvard Sucks!!!
It''s a good city. Don''t let anyone tell you otherwise. Go to Cafe Intermezzo but the one in midtown. 
:/
[deleted]
Georgia wins the honorary captain game
Former MMA fighter Herschel Walker!
And Espn cutting away lol
They don't have muscles ref???
B1G B1G CHAMPIONSHIP REFS BABY
<3 Frank 
They should change the coin flip to something more exciting. Like a 3 on 3 basketball game, first to 5 points.
It's the Dawwwggggggs! The RED and the BLACK! Gooooo Geooorrrrrrrrggggiaaaaahhhhh! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahZOVLWr31k
Herschel's the strongest, baddest dude on that field right nowand it's not even close
Oh shit big ten refs
Razza frazzen stupid Bama game
Good crowd chanting UCF UCF
Awww Mack. We good <3
B1G B1G B1G!!!!!
Herschel looks like he could still suit up and play. Probably in better shape than some of the guys on the field
GO DAWG GO!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Herschel is out of eligibility, right? 
It was hell watching last weekend. I got YouTube TV as a free trial and the stream is perfect. 
The latter is guaranteed, the former we can all hope for. Cheers bruh. 
They are always in for the National anthem. 
Main downside to a dome is no flyover after the anthem.
Howard was a beast, but when they got Herschel, you need to come harder than that Bama. 
WOOOOO BIG TEN
Dan Capron the ref.
Will the coin actually flip? 
Lol go read the Bill of Rights
#UH OH, BIG TEN REFS!!!!
Fuck this crowd is booing everything
i'm new to /r/cfb who should i shit on and what are some quick key shitpost memes i should know
God I feel like I might vomit.
where's that woman from the cotton bowl to flip the coin?
Praying
Why would ratings be higher because of Frank Beamer? 
You would think they would have it straightened out for the biggest game of the year. I can watch Pakistan cricket on espn3 with no problem but god forbid the final game works correctly.
Big Ten refsRIP game
#MACK!!!!!!!! <3
You just scroll down to stop it
Which nation? I'm not sure, I need excessive reminders
Go Dawgs. Let's do this!
So can we claim the Big 10 sucks if their refs suck? 
THEY SENT HERSCHEL OUT. I'M SHOOK
WatchESPN is the worst
He has one year of eligibility left...
B1G refs? I have no idea how well they will do
B1G refs, oh baby
This game isn't the same without the big bicep referee
Big 10? BOOOOOOO
B1G refs what up
Fuck Auburn, and Roll Tide Roll!
What conference are these guys from?
the suddenlink login has crashed already, cant get it going
Hersch is still built like a god damn tank. 
Look at them B1G refs being all Midwest nice. 
Forgot these >>>>>>>
I bet Kendrick Lamar's halftime performance will be totally apolitical
B1G clearly has the best refs.
WOOO B1G
Ah hell yea! Beamer!
Could we play some fucking ball here?  Jesus.
ITS BLOCKING PAT FITZGERALDS BEAUTIFUL FACE
Big 10 refs?  This could be a shit show
herschel walker looks good tbh
"We're here from the Big Ten Conference, and we're ready to fuck you"
App State! 
The head is a football, the tail is a mercedes benz. I GOT IT
We''re from the big 10 conferenceEveryone boos lol
Why not just use SEC refs
Only rage 
Hell no...screw Bama! We all want to see the giant fall lol
As a life long Georgia fan, winning anything important would be a great feeling.
The stable genius ™ knows it's, of course
I loled when one of the team captains said "Wassup DAWG?"
Georgia looks mean and Alabama looks confused
No more stress of coaching has been doing wonders for him
BIG 10 refs. Alabama going down confirmed. 
B1G REFS! REPRESENT!!!
Top notch Town. Since you're an App State fan (I'm assuming), I'll take you to all the 2nd or 3rd best places. The best places are reserved for Eagles. 
Say a bunch of white jerseys kneeling
Big Ten gonna treat you well boys!
BEST FLIP IT
Thank God its not Pac 12
I wish I could be more hype about this...but you know what go Dawgs. 
Just drink enough beer to make it taste good. 
I like you OJ, but I'm rooting for Georgia to win this one
Uh oh Big Ten refs. 
Ok Dan rig this so the B1G wins somehowI believe in you
How do you do that?
Herschel could suit up now and play
LMAO IS THAT REF CLOWNING BAMA
Shoulda got the Pac12 refs on this game
What are B1G refs like? Someone explain I haven't paid attention too much. 
Go Beamer newest inductee to cfb hall of fame
"We're from dah big ten ya and we're gonna officiate dah game for ya"
why are people acting surprised that the teams stayed in the locker room for the anthem? That's what they do every single week of the season.
Herschel still looks like he could put on pads and sneak onto the field.
Don't feel so left out B1G! The refs are here to represent you 
HOLY SHIT A FOOTBALL
All the booing toward Alabama lol
Better not see some B1G shit this game
Unpatriotic 
Big 10 refs? Fuck
B1G gonna get some revenge on the SEC tonight with these refs.
I'm pulling for Georgia because I like Ernie Johnson, and Alabama wins enough nattys.
70-30 Dawgs to Bama fans ratio, probably the Bama fans are just like, “well shit we''re in the title again? I''m still paying for the last time we were in this game”
Chills man, already.
Can we have the lady who flipped the coin for the Cotton Bowl?
I feel like being a fan is too much right now
Helll yeah ROLL TIDE!!!!!
Except he's still President :/
Can we just all breathe a collective sigh of relief that PAC12 refs aren''t officiating?
At least they ain't PAC-12 refs.
Just add some cheese and beer. You'll be alright.
Herschel will get some pads on for the third quarter
Feaster?? I barely know her!
It's crazy how all these fans are either hella rich or have a ton of disposable income lying around
Congrats man. I really hope you get to enjoy itCan't imagine watching my team play for something like this.. must be unreal
C'mon dogs. Fuck em up. Make our game last week look like the true NCG. Pls :( 
ACC refs wya
I wanted the players to be there to take a knee. He woulda lost it so hard 
7-0
Oh, this is the NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP GAME coin toss. I was confused about which coin toss this was going to be. 
Fiance's already asleep. Guess who's watching the game in bed?
Love the players kneeling 
Nobody gives a fuck what''s on the quarter ya old fuck
Walker was just knocking out his last 200 push-ups real quick that''s why he was behind for a second. 
Herschel is still a freakin' stud
This is such a traditional Rose Bowl matchup--Alabama vs Georgia! Roll Tide!
ayyyyy the b1g did make it after all 
Big Ten Refs, Big Bad Call
You just have to scroll down a little and it pauses.
It's been a fun season of shitposting, my friends. May we all awaken with no hangovers in the morning. 
Hersch can still suit up
I'm watching the game via a twitch stream where the streamer is on cam with a controller pretending to play NCAA 14. Sometimes I think I should just pay for cable. 
H8 FEEDS THE DAWG! H8 FEEDS THE DAWG! H8 FEEDS THE DAWG! H8 FEEDS THE DAWG! H8 FEEDS THE DAWG! H8 FEEDS THE DAWG! H8 FEEDS THE DAWG! H8 FEEDS THE DAWG! H8 FEEDS THE DAWG! H8 FEEDS THE DAWG!

Tails never fails
Herschel Walker vs OJ Howard? Come on Bama you can do better than that.
Buckle up boys holding doesn''t exist tonight!
And the reason why I used the word dislike is because it's along a spectrum and as such is not necessarily a strong word like hate. 
I'm rooting for my bowl buddies. 
How did OJ Howards rookie season go? I know the Bucs were a cluster fuck
Really, torn jeans to the coin toss?
Beamer! 
Wait the SEC Championship doesn''t even get SEC refs??
Anybody knows what happens to these special coins for these games?
Alabama can''t even lose a coin toss
Herschel looks like he could still dominate a football game.
Pretty sure it was UGA UGA
Oh thank god, was worried it''ll be PAC-12.
My girlfriend is here for the night, and we're spending the week together. We're snuggled up thanks to the cold front and watching football. We've got the fire going too, and the brownies are almost out of the oven! Gonna drizzle them in mayonnaise for the last ten minutes of baking.I love the College Football Championship. 
God tier flip. Not like that old hag from the rose bowl 
That coin looked extremely weighted towards tails
Jesus. B1G ref crew. Sorry in advance CFB fans
So are UCF fans even allowed to watch this game for fear of hypocrisy?
TAILS NEVER FAILS. WE WON. PACK IT UP.
I BET THESE REFS DONT EVEN PLAY DEFENSE
Santa, can I have one of those coins for Christmas this year?
Hersh looks like he could play today
Thank God that these aren't Pac 12 refs
https://imgur.com/BArF1FV
HELLO EVERYBODY CURRENTLY USING THE LIVE COMMENT FEED
As a 3rd party fan who is maybe a little more on the Georgia bandwagon tonight, I just want a good game and for nobody to get injured. These guys played hard all season and deserve a full 60 minutes, plus it's never good when a guy goes down with an injury.
B1G refs honestly do seem so much better than PAC12 and Big 12 refs at least...
Lol that B1G ref. So Midwestern. "We're gonna officiate your game for ya."
HerchSWOLE Walker
explaining real slow to the SEC schools the difference between heads and tails
BOOOOOOOOOO
12?
how does he figure there's 70-30 Georgia fans out there when both teams have the same color? lmao
Tails never fails!
hershel walker cuyler jr them dawgs is hell don''t they 
Big Ten ref yeet yeet
can''t we all just get along
Nah
Booing the B1G refs is going to be the highlight of the night. 
UCF should go full Ralph Nader and sue to be able to participate, and then break in if they aren't allowed to.
ESPN may get the sound right before this is over. 
Damn I bet Herschel wants to throw on a jersey and play rn.
So how will ESPN talk about Sam Darnold in this game?
Hershel Walker looks like he could run through both of these teams today
Herschel Walker > OJ Howard. Dawgs win confirmed
I am just here to watch a team that deserves to play in the CFP Championship game a team that doesn't.
Why isn't Mrs. Ewing here to toss the coin?
Then, he appears in John Lewis' "failing district," no less.
If you don't like ZBB then you can get out
https://i.makeagif.com/media/10-11-2015/0NDqnp.gif
The Dotard handlers thought this would be a slam dunk appearance but instead they created a meme. 
Ball game
Haha the ref definately  sounds like he is from the Big Ten
Bring Back Ripped Ref!
[removed]
Lol think the B1G got more boos than the president
Herschel looks like a fucking beast.  Dude is what 50?
B1G fans, how down-the-middle are your ref crews?
Where''s trump gone 
what crew officiated the rose bowl? we need those guys back
Henlo
Herschel twice my age and twice as good of shape
Yep! His health got a LOT better after retirement m
Ebay
!remindme 3 hours
Do you think refs practice the coin flip
He''s doing half time
At least its not Pac-12 refs.....
Herschel still looks like he could kickass if you gave him a helmet and pads right now...
Big 10
B1G refs. Guess we didn't get left out of the playoff after all.
Jesus Walker is ripped
"Georgia do you want the ball?"
Alabama won the toss, game over 
He almost forgot to make them shake hands lol
College games always do this.
So Bama deferred and then the umpire asked Georgia if they want the ball... what happens if they say no? 
Finally it starts. 
I hate it. 
Good luck Bama, B1G ref crew please just let the players play, and LET'S GO DAWGS! SICC 'EM!
"From the Big 10 conference"*Inaudible boos*My people
I'm trying to recall- in college football do the players run out prior to the national anthem?  Gonna be a good game!
The sweet release of death
If Chubb had said "no" would the game start?
Oh boy, B1G refs
Love seeing some representation of NC colleges in the HOF
"for you"
LET'S GO DAWWWWWWWWWWWWGGGGGGGGGGGGSSSSSSSSS
yo im digging mack's shoes
69= niceH8 FEEDS THE DAWG
I just got butterflies all of a sudden.    LETS PLAY BALL
No Pac12 refs? how disappointing /s
I don't understand using heads/tails and having someone pick. Just use the teams' logos.
"You wanna win or lose?"
Well done ref. Well done. You even got both teams right.
B10 Refs.. better than the crap the PAC-12 refs..
Beamer lost weight 
lol were those boos for the Big 10 refs?
We did lol
I''m confident he''s immortal 
Bourbon tonight. Go Dawgs!
3500 comments before the coin was tossedRIP /r/cfb
"We're gonna kick towards the end zone"...k lol
Roll Tribe 
HERE WE GO
Plz tell
Lmao the ref explaining it to both teams like they haven't learned to read yet. 
Fuck am I on a Facebook live thread? This “live” shit is messing with my mind 
Lol @ 75 staring 27 down
We don't trust Namath to not show up tanked
Better than big 12 refs
Ketchup that bitch
Yeah, but you've got to consider academics too. UGA is one of the better Academic schools, on par with Florida and a good step behind Vanderbilt. 
BIG TEN MADE THE CHAMPIONSHIP GAME
This ref smug as fuck. His smile there said "this shit get into your thick skull, jumbo?"
Big 10 refs, lame coin. 
Herschal looks like he could suit up right now
The first time I've ever felt this way before a NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIPGO DAMN DOGS!!!!! 
Link?
The shitposting has only just begun
It''s better than pac 12 and big 12 refs 
I can't believe you're getting downvoted for a literally true statement.
And the Big Ten is still on the field for the National championshipB1G! B1G!
They could just put Herschel into the game. Fucking dude is a jacked tank.
Because they want competent refs
They get sold to cash4gold.com
"Georgia you want the ball?" Well they don't have much of a choice do they
Someone go fetch that old lady who tossed the coin like a fuckin frisbee for this.
T A I L SAILS
Why would you defer the decision??
Uh, is the ref drunk?
Having a B1G ref crew is just salt in the wound lol. 
LEEEETTTSSSSS GOOOOOOOOO
I would pay this ref money to say "Go Bears"
PM me a link, the same guy did it for the UFC once I think
Never thought I'd see a Lamar Cardinals flair lol #Peckem
Big Ten refs? Zero holding penalties confirmed. 
3.6K comments before the cointoss haha, jesus
That''s one Big-10 ass accent on the ref. 
"I'm not your dog, guy!"
Canadian football starts in July. So only like 7 months if you count that
Shit just got real. See you in four quarters.
***We are live at the SEC Championship!***
Just remember, whoever wins, we all lose.
Are the big ten refs good? 
http://nctrappers.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/qweqwe123123-1024x619.png
Not Bama
Just joking my dude
No seriously wtf did espn do to voices? That was the best part. You had drunk espn people having fun. Now it's a mess
WE WANT PAC12 REFS!!!!
I''m bored. When will the commercials start?
Why isn''t OJ Simpson one of the color commentators
Dont feed the dog chocolate. Just h8
Sup Chubb Bros!
Ours was written by a dude literally watching a battle as we fought for our independence. And it''s to the tune of a drinking song. Can it even GET any better?
Saban with the sassy neck
Also Patriots fan, Yankees fans, and members of the First Order
Good.  Death planes are a degenerate travesty.  They took humanity's greatest achievement and turned it towards Satanic purposes.Now, if someone were to do a 747 flyover, on the other hand...
Good luck tonight Dawgs!
Is it bad if I'm sad Herschel didn't come out shirtless?
Have to imagine POTUS being there has security in a nightmare. 
Lot of fans didn't have to get hotel rooms. 
Have we won a coin toss this year?
Woo!
WHOO!
Haha
Alabama is not been favored in only one game since 2009
Wishing well somewhere...
Im excited to see who the runner up to UCF will be
B1G refs, we good
WE DID IT
No one cause you're watching it on the big TV in the living room?
That red did a pretty good job with the toss. Where is this officiating crew from?
Can''t believe my team is actually in this. Let''s go dawgs. 
Proof that God hates us: this game is on WatchESPN.
Ohh man 
Get fucking hyped! Wasn't sure when i'd get a chance in my life to see Georgia play in a National Championship.
Fucking Comcast.
We made the playoffs boys!!!!!
sadly i think this game will be over by half but i hope not. =/
That''s the number that will get equal amounts of money on both sides. Nothing more. The betting public thinks Bama will win but not by too much. 
I got one in my change at a Taco Bell once
I served in the military too and think it''s too much. It''s not that I don''t support the troops, it''s that I don''t think we should be glorified for the shit we''ve done. Some nasty shit goes on man. Let a soldier you know you appreciate he *or she* does hard work so you aren''t forced to, but don''t glorify it. Edit: he or she. I served combat arms so women weren''t as common. They still serve too though. 
Thank god the officials aren't from any conference ending with a 12
We have lost the last three coin tosses. Gotta get rid of the flipping coordinator 
Saban always seems drunk
his hands were surprisingly unshaky
Who gives a fuck about the coin.
Only way the B1G made the playoff :(
ALABAMA
I believe SlingTV has been pushing a free trial. Might be worth looking into to watch then cancel. 
Hit the sort comments by thing and one of the choices is live.
Yay not Big 12 or Pac 12 refs!
Anyone got that coin toss vs win% analysis?
[removed]
Please let this be a good game so everyone who said they''re not watching misses out on a classic
Do you believe that we can win this fight tonight?
Let's go football!!!!
Good luck dawg bros!
What is this B1G bullshit? WE WANT MUSCLES!!!
Never will we hear "We are from the PAC 12. We will be officiating your game tonight."
It's an all SEC match-up, so they should use sec refs 
I'd give like a million dollars for Saban to just be like "Fuck off, Tom."
$25mm a year and he has a haircut like that.  
Nic Saban's head is never still when he talks. 
We need to bring back visors
Ready for everyone to accuse these refs of making calls for Alabama again
How?
Not the PAC12 that's for sure.
But that ain't traditional my dude
GO DAWGS 
With the NFL at least I think there is some contractual thing where you can only watch if you have a Verizon phone. 
You could still slap a jersey on him and play him.
Good call
Hershel still looks like he can give UGA a solid 1000 yrd season.
"The logo of the College Football Playoff TM"
Doubtful. Their broadcasting probably couldn't suck any worse than it does. 
Tails never fails
wait....does deferring to second half not mean that you are taking the kick at halftime? why did he ask if georgia wanted the ball or not?
What if the coach tells his captain to defer and he chooses to receive 
My bootleg stream hasnt skipped or frozen even once yet lmao
Do you believe that we can walk on water?
Remember O.J. Howard? Remember how Lane Kiffin kept him locked up in a coffin for the entire season and then had him obliterate Clemson in the Natty?
I have no real complaints. 
Anyone who voted for that idiot is ignorant and/or stupid.
Imagine if the PAC12 refs were calling this game...the madness
Including mine 
Hey, could have been PAC-12. 
Maria Taylor is so sexy 
I love kirby so much though...
His first name is Hershel but he may as well be Jesus in Athens. 
Ow, why?
Hunker down and chop some wood.
Has a team ever kicked in both halves? 
Lol the head referee Dan is actually a pretty nice guy 
What a formal introduction.  B1G refs confirmed the nicest in the NCAA
Let''s go Pruitt!
Walker looks like he's ready to suit up! 
Tails never fails
I'll root for what ever teams fans are more angry at UCF 
I'd rather it be screatchy than flat
the longest coin toss of all-time
Cannot keep up with the Live comment feed on mobile lol. Haven''t even kicked off and it''s flying 
Saban looks sick
they are melted down and ground to dust to be used for seasoning in Nick Saban's food.
So they can defer the ball to the 2nd half and Georgia could have elected to kick off anyway?  
Finally we can stop we can stop with the epic montages and predictions 
Crimson =\= Red?”
lmao right? Especially when they're already making custom coins...
On Spectrum cable, espn HD. The Rose Bowl looked great but this one not so much. 
[deleted]
Big 10 refs are as bad
Maria on UGA side they have to win now
Goddamn, this atmosphere is fucking awesome!  College football is truly the greatest game on the face of the earth.  
LET''S GO DAWGS!!!
LETS GOOOOOOOO 
Some commercial had him shirtless,  he is unreal. 
My guess is it goes to some big wig with the CFP committee.
always
Sometimes?
#cointosswasrigged
Yeah it''s ridiculous hahah
They said this game started at 5 so I rushed home to watch the pregame. Its 5:20
Game hasn't started and there are already 4000 comments on this thread. Damn. 
Tails never fails
Does Nick Saban age? And is it possible to look more Georgian than Kirby Smart?
...I'm at work, and have the game on the TV and someone just walked in, looked at the TV, and said, "who's playing?"I couldn't think of anything to say, I just kinda stared at himoh, and I'm in the Florida Panhandle, where there's SEC people everywhere 
Alabama defers? clearly they are scared and want to get the ball first in the 2nd half because they aren't confident in scoring early and think they might be down ^^^^/s
I wish Laura Rutledge was doing the reporting :(
Everybody fix yourself and turn on the Coaches round table broadcast
Big Don attending the game!
That's what this game is all about.  Pure salt.
Is this the game for the NCAA runnerup?
3,800 comments and we just finished the coin toss...
> Gonna drizzle them in mayonnaise...Wut?
I got $5 on bama so I'm rooting for them, roll tide
The ref says "I'm from the Big Ten" Crowd: BOOOOOOOOOOOOYep, lot of SEC fans at this game, haha
It is the SEC...
"A football is the thing you play with"
Kirby's accent is GOD TIER
yeah nick
Only 1500 pushups a day now that he's older
I think they are pretty good i cant really think of big blown calls recently
So my Reddit app doesn't allow me to sort by "new" and only allows the traditional options and "live" which is unreadable as fuck cause the comments keep scrolling and it's so many it crashes my app. How tf do I fix this???
"You see, this coin was forged under the pressure of my mother's ass. Quite the collectors piece."
Kirby Smart's eye movements: "Oh man I am so high right now look at those lights"
[Me when Bama wins the coin toss cause everything always plays out in their favor...](http://www.reactiongifs.com/r/y3PWaHz.gif)
There's 3 different versions of the game to watch. I have no idea which to watch.
Is watch espn not loading for anyone else?
Unless it's heads
Easily could... he's more yoked now than his playing days.
Watch ESPN.  Now there''s deception in marketing.  
So the Big 10 did send a team to the playoffs
Hunker down one more time dawgs 
Charity auctions probably.

Herschel Walker could still suit up
He was on TV the other day and I paused with him on and asked my wife how old she thought he was. Her answers were 29, no wait, 36. Dude is a genetic freak of nature. 
Sweet baby jesus....you deserve a raise.
"the head on the coin, as you can see, is a football. as this is the football game championship. everyone follow me so far?"
What if Georgia didn't want the fucking ball asshat
Yeah it''s happened before I think 
Im 3 hours away from Atlanta but I dont just have 2k to throw on tickets
Anybody else see Big Ten referees, laugh, and buckle in for a bumpy ride?
"Score some goddamn points"
pretty good rotation, although i like a faster spin.  perfect height.  landed right in front of everyone.  solid coin flip overall.  8/10
HUNKER DOWN DAWGS ONE MORE TIME
Kirby and Nick: I ain't got time for this shit.
Boxcar? It's the only place I've found to watch games where people are into sports. 
All of the ones used since 1994 are in my nightstand drawer.
I forgot how tall Maria is.
The losing team will get Alabama Hot Pockets.
Sign up for a free trial of Hulu live or sling or something dont do that to yourself
Do you like driving in your truck?
“Heads is in the shape... of a football.” Ooooh, thanks ref!
Get sling tv or YouTube tv free trial, quick!
That referee was so well spoken. It was like listening to an audio book.
i respect how human this ref sounds
Saban looks tired as hell
MAKE VISORS GREAT AGAIN
Big ten referees. Good news for all the big 10 fans. Still have a shot to see the big 10 blow a championship game. 
Pay attention to wifey bruh.
yeah, its basically a cable streaming package. you can stream espn live, but unlike watchespn is doesnt suck
Alabam won the coin toss, win or loose, that's A quality loss
So if you defer the other team can choose to kick right?
Heads always deads
Yes but that would just means Georgia kicks twice. 
I mean he is big, fat that is...
Mike Gundy's mullet is glorious
ROLL TIDE!
ROLL TIDEGO DAWGSDOES NOT COMPUTE
Yes, Texas did it against Cal back in 2014 I think.
Not if they want the game called fair. :P
Don't like him personally but I'm with you, I don't understand what the big deal is. More interesting to me is that they didn't allow the players out for the anthem.  I have never seen that before and if I'm not mistaken when the NFL players chose to do that a certain someone (and group of people) were PISSED about it.
Bro.... African American commentator
What would happen if: as a captain, I took a shit as my coin toss decision?
Yeo
WE DONT NEED YOU BIG TEN REFS SCREW YOU WE CAN OFFICIATE OUR OWN GAME ^AtleastTheyArentACCorPAC12
Auburn isn't playing, who would pay them????
All I can cheer for at this moment
I don't remember what life was like before Alabama started destroying everyone.
They eventually end up entombed in ruins, held in the pockets of various Draugr.
Oh I was born ready
Maria Taylor makes coaches look tiny.
Can we just start the game already, please?  Gotdamn.
Very well spoken ref. Most just mumble through that
I'm going to be sick
Is WatchESPN not working for anyone else? 
this is so fucking hype
It's the only appropriate response.
I feel like Kirby and Maria Taylor will smash after this game. Lots of sexual tension.
What happened? I just turned on the tv
B1G refs don't call holding on the offensive line so this should be fun.
There''s always the hope that Saban/Belichick/Brady retires in some combination  
It wont I have a good feeling its going to last minute
4000 comments and the game hasn't startedWhat
Last game of the season! Let''s go babaaayyy!
Ope.
I know we bitch constantly but I wouldn''t be surprised if there is a lack of holding calls against OL.
Shhhhhhh
the ATLANTA on the field isn't centered right! AHHH.
#HUNKER DOWN
The fuck you just say man? Mayonnaise?
Someone might literally die on the field, but I can't say I wouldn't love to see the zebras let them play.
I''m shaking. I don''t know if I''m cold or nervous. 
No it was totally a different thing meant to be a message 
"Alabama has deferred, Georgia do you want the ball?"Wasn't aware they had a choice. 
Kirby must have been told not to call her "girl" anymore
Saban, red eyes, crying, retirement after this confirmed!
I'm not sure I agree with the ref having the leading question of "Georgia, you want the ball?" Let them decide--maybe they would like to kick?
THANK YOU GIRL
He seemed so polite
So Georgia could make the mistake of saying they''d kick 
Herschel shaking like michael j fox
Best coin flip execution I've seen in years. Props to the ref!
Theyre lying
And then he said “Georgia has elected to receive the ball”. .... uhh no they didn''t 
Show Mrs. Ewing the respect her husband earned.
Dear Lord, please look over my Dawgs tonight...and my liver. Nothing but respect, Bama. Let's do this. 
I like you, nerd
I love Alabama. When Alabama scores I will say “yes.” When Georgia scores I will say “no.”
Do they realize those Pom poms don't make noise
Win the toss, lose the game!
When does UCF join the game?
Is putting mayonnaise on brownies a thing?
Yes, but Alabama could then opt to receive at the beginning of the second half. They put off their choice of what to do until the second half begins.
Georgia can pick a side instead. 
I was a Florida State fan back then, pretty self explanatory 
Can't help but feel Pitt go robbed by not being in the championship game 
Everybody slow down. I can't keep up with comments.
So, I'd the refs decide the game, does that count as a win for the B1G? 8-1?
Can someone tell me how to do the live comments on mobile?
Gotta leave the big 12 out of the playoff for that. 
Considering how the SEC games have been at the end of the year I agree. Several games between @two evenly matched teams” were almost blowouts. 
T H I C C B O I I making the call on the coin toss. T H I C C B O I I is G O O D B O I I 
Does Nick Saban even comb his hair? God damn savage. Wait, the other coach has a visor. More offensive.
Praying.
Interesting that neither of these teams have lost to a non-Auburn opponent this season
25 million a year? No..
A lot of comments for a game that a lot of people weren''t going to watch! 
How bout that stadium tho?
Texas kicked twice in Strong''s first game I believe 
Upvote the game thread. TO THE FRONT PAGE!!!
shoulda been McElroy right?
Unfortunately, I still want you guys to lose
added to my memery thx
I am rooting for the non-Patriots of college football.
Was impressed by Herschel Walker. Looks good for not having played in 20 years.
I'm from Florida. I didn't even apply to that online school.
That was a very, very mild accent. They probably picked him because of his lack of heavy accent tbh. 
Fuck Bama 
How tall is Kirby? 
Shit I missed it!
Kirby turned these talented Richt guys into top 2 team legit. Respect.
*sees Big 10 ref* oh so the Big 10 did make the playoffs
RAT POISON 
The coaches room giving some great insight. "They usually let people play, so if you need to hold receivers, go ahead and hold"
Yup, but then Alabama would have chosen to receive in the second half. They defer the choice, not receiving.
No he didnt lol
Maybe he's born with it, maybe it's maybelline.Edit: Either way I'm weirdly curious
WOOF WOOF WOOF WOOF WOOF WOOF IDGAF JUST BEAT BAMA PLS DAWGS
Hey at least the BIG 10 has something in the national championship!
Meh the season ended a week ago, we're still celebrating our win to worry about 3rd place
bold strategy
When Canada plays, we can dispense with the “nationalism”.  But, as I pointed out, this literally is the National Championship.  Besides, many of us love it. 
Yup, Mike Leech once kicked twice by accident.
LOL I wanted to say this but was afraid it wouldn't go down well
Yeah, like they used to "boo" Arsenio Hall.
I wish I didn''t have mental clutter. Saban please help me
Where can I watch this without cable?
I'm so conflicted.  I dont care for bama but we actually compete with georgia for recruits and isaiah wilson really annoyed me.  
He was bigger than the guys in pads.
that would be terrible
fake news is infiltrating the comments. Couldn't hear any boos on TV
well r/cfb... it's been a fun year.  through all the ups, downs, highs, and lows, it's been a blast watching with you. good luck georgia and alabama fans.  let's send this season out with a game to remember.
Its code was written by univ of iowa students.
Get medicine 
Hey mods, fix the fucking comment limit. 10 minutes between each comment during a live sporting event? Are you fucking serious?
GO DAWGS
[removed]
Eminem?
Traffic and security is apparently a mess right now. 
goddamn it
Roll dawgs!
HERE WE GO
It's the captain's call, so... an upset coach I guess
Gotta root for Pruitt, so... roll tide?Someone please send help 
All hail the occupying overlords 
4k comments before kick off. Its lit fam
They definitely snuck in, but that doesn't mean they didn't deserve it. They've proved they did. They're one of the best and now have a chance to play the other for it all. Win or lose Bama need not be ashamed.
I will hold you to this
B1G playing the long con getting left out just to dick over the SEC with our refs.
Word is the crowd is like 70% Georgia.
Hell yeah 
You know he's gonna sneak up behind Chubb and steal his uniform Mission Impossible style if UGA goes down too much.
B1G teams so proud of the ref lol
same
TRADITION!
Exactly
If Georgia can score more points than Alabama then they have a good chance to win.
Every stream on cfbstreams sucks
Before the game starts, to both Bama and Georgia fans.I hope the game is reffed wellI hope there are no injuries to either sideI hope the best team wins.But I think we can both agree, no matter the outcome FUCK AUBURN!!
Did Alabama just get to choose to defer to the 2nd half AND the direction they kick ?!?! 
Lets go DAWGS
Fucking Michigan...
I'm counting about 10 comments a second. This should be result in a great discussion. 
3rd place game 
Star spangled banner gets really high and those dudes sing flatter than kansas. The state not the band
I root for you Georgia! You were nice to me when I wore Clemson gear on G day unknowingly. 
Bama would get it twice. Not long ago a dude called kicking instead of deferring. The got to kick twice.
I think he''s explaining it to an audience of one. 
[deleted]
Thanks UGA and Bama fans for giving POTUS whatfor.Now let's football!
RIC FLAIR DRIP GO WOO ON THE TIDE
Yea, if they wanted to, but since alabama gets the choice after halftime, they would just take the ball, making UGA kick twice. 
Dude their harmonization is impeccable. What are you talking about?
Oh shit the game us starting! [Let me set the mood](https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/salt_pour1a.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200)
When does the number of comments get too bad? 10000 will be here before you know it. 
If Georgia had elected to kick off, then Alabama would have recieved both kickoffs to start the 1st half and 2nd half.
Just remember, B1G refs don't call holding on the offensive line.  Keep that mind.
Amen
Literally never. Lagging a ton already. 
"Georgia do you want the ball?" Well shit they dont have a choice if they just loss the flip. LOL
Not a college football fan at all.  But I'm a huge fan of active comments during big sporting events.  Good luck everyone.
oooooooooooooooooooooooo
He'd rather be drawing up schemes and watching film for next year's championship.
Nah it's cool, keep it up
Because he murdered his wife in 1994
GO DAWGS
which broadcast are you watching?
And still 50/50 lol
I don't really see how thats relevant 
It is so worth it
Were I a coach I would hate these little sideline reporter blurbs. I have a fucking game to start coaching, I don't want to try and give a little soundbite.
I love me some Kirby Smart. 
I just want a healthy and clean game.  GO DAWGS!!! 
Media responsibilities sound awful Could you imagine its the biggest day of the year at your office, and someones shives a mic in your face before you can even start working?
Yeah, I just can't imagine any scenario where you'd want to do that
Will the amount of comments from the championship threads be equal to 100 times the amount of points scored here?
FLAIR UP SON
#PERCUSSION
It''s the SEC after all /s
Nick Saban botoxes for sure right?
If you say no to that question you kickoff both halves.. its real dumb that its asked.
quick i'm new gimme some memes before it starts
They wanted refs from the best* conference*perfect bowl record
Weren''t they Thai? The Japanese would have impeccable animations. 
Bama has an opportunity to get the ball during both halves 
I'm projecting a 12:10 AM finish to this game. Good news is that I don't have any classes tomorrow
Kirby Smart, head football coach of the University of Georgia, sounds exactly how you'd expect him to sound.
I think he misspoke 
She's a UGA grad
ESPN stream if you have sling
The deliverance crowd are downvoting you...but you're correct.
Kick off baby WOOT WOOT!!!!!!!!!!!!
Pat Fitzgerald's a dork.  MOAR GUNDY.
[deleted]
At some point Saban will have literally run out of words to say on these championship interviews
[deleted]
Here we go yall
Are you Military?
They can choose to kickoff but that wouldn''t make much sense because they would kickoff twice at the beginning and at half. It has happened before where the team kicks off twice 
Well he only played three years...
B1G refs confirmed best at coinflips
Jake Fromm State Fromm.
These seats have a ton of red in them...
I love the explicit "I hardly give a shit about this interaction" vibe Saban always gives reporters.  Especially on the sidelines during games.  
I'm on Joey for Reddit on Android and can't sort by Live, but New works fine.
This past week of football has been amazing
Why the hell is it so hard to find streams for CFB games? 
Do reddit is fun
Read faster 
After watching this bowl season, surprisingly not as bad as pac12/big12, but still pretty bad. Holding is always a crap shoot, and their spots always seem wonky no matter who's playing.
Eyes were bloodshot, no? 
GOOOOOOOOO DAWGS! SIC EM!
Watching it live and just got caught by the image of a bunch of black people being overshadowed behind a few white men. Nothing against the vocals of the people, but the image was... less then flattering. 
Same. 
So many people commenting, nobody''s going to get upvoted.
Wonder who The Don is pulling for...
@ESPN your app is the worst
Giving it like 2 freezes before I just switch to the all 22 cam
Yup. Quite the theatrics for second place!
Don''t use the app.
It's already untenable 
only the "command center" screen is working for me
YouTube has it going on in terms of streaming
Over 4K comments and the game has JUST started.
7 playoff games for JK Scott? Holy damn
Herby just said 70/30 uga fans 
Saban stopped by a legal state on the way to the stadium. 
can I get an ID on Mack Brown's shoes
Standing by for Arkansas, Tennessee and their ilk to beat their SEC chests.

Why are they playing the SEC Championship game in January? 
DO YOU THINK YOU CAN WIN THIS FIGHT TONIGHT?
Does anyone feel uncomfortable when Nick Saban occasionally looks directly into the camera during interviews? 
Very iffy kickoff from Bama.
Why can't we just get a new filter live thread is too damn fast
TAYLOR SWIFT PERCUSSION
He just never smiles. Really.

you guys... why do we not have a semi-finals losers playoff? WHERE'S MY FUCKING BRONZE MEDAL 
Here we go guys!
have class in an hour and a half, fuck
Go UCF!
Yeah Bama deferred their choice to the second half. Georgia now gets to choose and Bama will choose after halftime
That has nothing to do with us. It's reddit itself.
So its finally come. I have to root for the most spoiled fanbase in all college football or my archrival.
I cant read any of these comments
I bet he wasn''t expecting that 
? Alabama elected to differ as if it say "makes no difference to us we're the better team" then the ref asked Georgia do you want the ball and Georgia said yes.
Since UCF is the champion of Florida, does the winner of this get the other 49 states?
The popovich approach 
it was a kickoff.
Can you tell something more overused?
God no. Don't let the captains screw this up unless they absolutely demand to.
You don't want to win? 
Not available in my area it says.  Can't even find a reliable stream either Jesus.
[removed]
Why the fuck does Bama have a black endzone?
Alabama technically defers their *choice* until the second half, so Georgia could theoretically choose to kick to start.
I believe technically they could choose to kickoff at the start of both halves
Falcons blew a 28-3 lead in the Super Bowl last year
Alien Blue? Or reddit app? Alien Blue I have a fix, but not the latter.
My southern ears heard that accent at an 11
Well, he's used to calling games for academically inclined athletes here in the B1G... Probably needed to make sure those SEC guys understood what was happening.
Sony + Chubb?
What are y'all drinking? It's a Spotted Cow for me.
Does the white on Bama''s uniforms look slightly yellowish to anyone else?
They could say no. Then they would kick off at the start and the half.
I think it's just cause you're a new account. I can shit post as quickly as I type. 
time 2 shitpost
Yes
The only good thing about the season coming to an end is the end of those commercials. 
Thank you!!!
scoring on a mike stoops defense isn''t an accomplishment.
Its why im here
LIKE AN AWESOME DUDE??????
A lot of students dress up for games in the south. I''ve worn button downs and khakis with boots to our games before on several occasions. 
People think the comments are moving fast in this thread. I tried to chat in the Super Bowl thread last year, it was absolutely impossible to read anything.
Yeah, good broadcasting skillz, ESPN.
I bet 300000 dollars the SEC teams wins the game.
Ironic, considering how much our President contributes to it being a cesspool
Are Georgia and ND still friends?
I haven't felt such an energy for a game like this since the legendary USC/Texas championship.
Alabama defense overpowering on first play.
Ridiculous 
There are a few instances people have kicked twice.
DO YOU BELIEVE THAT WE CAN WIN THIS FIGHT TONIGHT
How did Alabama defer and get to choose sides? Did I miss something?
They don't call them hot takes for nothing! 
I'm literally chugging salt right now just to be safe. 
It''s not fair that he''s 19 years old and already so successful at life.Fuck.
Jalen Hurts''s hairline is just awful. 
Come on Dawgies.
what if his boy tom brady's in it?
ROLL TIDE, IN-STATE BROS
Representing WVU...go dawgs 
bama about to roll georgia
2 min left on the 4th. They drop elbows from the roof. 
We have the most openly partisan president of our time on the field. It''s gonna be controversial. 
That was a really nice 1 yard loss
Genuinely not trying to politics bait: Was there actually boo''ing inside the stadium during announcement of POTUS? If so, how loud? Listening on radio and nothing came through.
they could choose to let bama take the ball
LET'S GO ROLL TIDE!!!
Ok, Dawgs. Set your pace, set your tone, kick em in the teeth. 
What is the advantage of deferring your choice to kick or receive? Do they really have no preference whatsoever?
Oof. That sucks man. 
shut up man
WELL WOOFED
Wonder how much of this I can watch before the wife makes me go watch the bachelor with her.
Anybody have a stream for the game?
I wish my legal ESPN stream was half as reliable as my illegal streams
Roll tide
which view you guys using to watch?
That's reddit, not us. Take it up with the admins.
Question: When Alabama wins their 100th National Championship, can they fit the number 100 on their default helmet? 
I'm still pissed about that squib kick. 
Bama gonna dominate.
I''m wearing grey sweatpants and a red shirt. I''m the dawg now 
They can actually say no. Alabama would get the ball second half and first half then though. It has been done before.
**TANK WATCH**: Chicago Bulls down 15-6 in the 1st quarter.
Wow, what an effort to just stay up after that first hit
Roll Damn Tide
Other than that I was pretty impressed with how clearly he spoke and explained things, lotta refs seem to mumble through these things. 
Cmon ESPN I need that sky cam
Already? How my dude 
I love Aaron Murray 
Yeah I think that''s how the entire game will go
GO DAWGS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Either way one of them loses.
they do have a choice because bama deferred their choice to the second half
I''m not having issues lol
"First minute thread"
> Works hard just to lose one yardHarsh 
Glad we won't have to hear that song ever again
Give me that sky cam
Pretty sure you have class tomorrow too, you won't miss much.
I think they could choose what side of the field they wanted and then Alabama would get to choose to Kick/ReceiveBut then in the 2nd half Alabama would get to choose whether to Kick/Receive or what side to defend...
If they can make these graphics, they can make an NCAA 18 video game.
These animations are so lame omg lol
I hope these WRs do good so it'll be easier to draft RBs in my dynasty league.
RIP my blood pressure
Were you watching the Fox News Broadcast? Lol. I could definitely hear a solid chunk of boos.
Only big game on tonight and the app blows.
Will this thread even make it through the first quarter?
Man, this is like watching the Super Bowl. WTF
You're allowed to kick. It's just a real stupid choice. UT did it a few years under Strong because the captain was adamant that he wanted to kick.
> it was absolutely impossible to read anything.Patriots fans are impossible in general.
r/CFBstreams
Watching this game as a PowerPoint given the quality of the stream. Thanks ESPN!
These animations...
COME ON DEFENSE
[Lmao](https://mobile.twitter.com/ClayTravis/status/950537358134403077)
lol this animation 
Over/under 130 pass yards for Hurts this game?Pretty sure 131 is his Playoff career high.
Did they hire those Taiwanese animators?
They should.
Sooo what''s up with the Thai animation
Here comes Jake From State Farm...
Can ESPN add another facet to the megacast and it just be people reading comments from  r/cfb ?
It used to work well. I remember watching the 4 way split screen with no problems. With as big of a company that ESPN is, there's no way the app should be this shitty for this long. My theory is that it's shitty on purpose so people associate streaming with buffering and lags. Make cable the superior product so the cord cutting will stop.
Man what are these graphics this looks like madden 05
they are both evil tho
Peanut butter cup porter
Da''wgs
Ahhh I''m so nervous
Jake Fromm State Farm let's see what you got. 
Jet sweeps don''t work against Bama 
WHO'S THAT COMIN DOWN THE TRACK
Chat is moving so fast nobody will see this.
Stuck on the Skycam because I cant get any other fucking WatchESPN stream to load :):):):)::):):):):)
I just heard TSwift Ready For It in the background. Sellout hack frauds
Nooo
This is something I didn't know but made the mistake when I used to play. When the team defers they automatically get it in the second half, so if you kick you basically don't get to start either half. So imagine my embarrassment when the ref had to correct me lol
[removed]
The graphics dude is fucking LOVING LIFE RIGHT NOW
Incoming###NCG: Georgia vs. Alabama (8PM ET) First Quarter - Last 5 Minutes

That's some sweet roster listings.  
Solid contact, good wrap up. Liking this so far.
LMAO at those CGI players
Nice claymation 
hmm so salt is a way of life in /r/cfb, tooi shouldn't have suspected any different
I guess espn''s layoffs included the CGI guys
We select football.
What I want to happen: Georgia to win in the interest of it being fun What I'm 98% sure will happen: Alabama will win #HOPE FOR A GOOD GAME 
Those player animations are amazing.
But where did Jake come Fromm?I'll leave now
The ESPN guy is only there to make sure Gundy doesn''t sneak a flask
The seats themselves are also red to add to it.
ESPN using NFL 2K for their graphics 
Oof. 
Couldn't hear it on tv
This is how you die...
Was there a chance of Canada playing? What about Argentina? No? It's just the US? National anthems make no sense unless it's an international game. 
In 2012, UGA and Alabama played the NCG in the SEC title game. This year, they play the SEC title game in the NCG.
What the shit is Nick Chubb made of, how did he survive that tackle
They''re very interesting
It shows confidence
Coaches
i just hope this is a good game and not a blowout either way
> Santa Fe
At her mom's house sadly. WatchESPN is the best I've got
Tonight's graphics provided by EA's NCAA 2014. 
^walk^on^waterrrrr
It gets much thicker up north. 
Showing off the 2k18 graphics?
Just yell Go Dawg every time your screen doesn't lag
ESPN thinks we want player introductions with PS2 player models
Here's to GeorgiaHere's to BamaHere's to BILL BRASKY
Let's go Dem Dawgs!
No you don't ;)
/r/CFBStreams 
CGI jerseys look garbage
God I love football.
r/CFBstreams
I feel like whoever did these animations waited until the last minute and had to pull an all-nighter last night 
This game is interesting 
Honestly it was hard to tell. There was a ton of noise overall at that point.
Slants, on the other hand...
They like starting the second half with the ball... did the same thing in the playoff game
ROLL TIDE*gags*
This comment thread is almost as fast as tyler1's today
ESPN Score Display: unranked Alabama vs. unranked Georgia in the National Championship Game
Did you see the heinous "sword in the stone" animation for Saban's proteges earlier? 
You defer to the 2nd half of the game. Which means you get to choose to receive to start the 2nd half. Which is better
Ah, and how long have you been a member of ISIS? 
hmm. okay thanks, will try and get it through there.edit: got it on mobile at least for now.
Georgia would kick off both times.  That's what happened to my high school once.  The captain didn't understand the concept of deferred and picked which side to defend instead of getting the ball.
^^^stream2watch ^^^is ^^^your ^^^friend
They getting these graphics from cfb 14?
ESPN showing their love for old ncaa games with these throwback cgi animations
what are these fifa 12-esque animations 
They CAN. But they can''t. 
this thread already has 4500 posts
Why can''t I put the comments setting to new?
Madden 2004
I remember this from last week...
it's on ESPN's end
I wasn't a fan of the way they did the lineups with the video game player images lol
I was adding in the value of the free sneakers he receives.  
Not ideal start
THEY HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY
And still got booed lol
Amen
Hey everyone how''s the game just curious been staring at a watchespn error screen for 17 minutes
Maybe we'll get the best of NFL ref call this game. Index card, forward progress stopped, senile ball spotting.
Pretty sure at points I'm averaging 5 fps
These graphics make me miss the NCAA games :(
Bama scary
God im so fucking nervous I wanna throw up
CMON GEORGIA BROS
Johnny Manziel 2.0!!!!
Lol Fromm what was that?
No shit!
Raise your hand if you're a strong independent B1G team who don't need no playoff. 
My god
Cheer for eternal OT, thats the way to go
Guarantee you he would average at least 100 yards a game. He was bigger than the guys in pads and none of it looked like fat.
Alabama defense appears to want to blow their load early. 
Aaaannd fuck
B1G out here representing in this game...lets go refs
Turn off f.lux?
Jesus, atta boy Chubb.
LETS GO BABY
I really don't care about either of these teams. UCF would have been more entertaining to watch.
Hell in the Cell style? Is Mic Foley here?
MOBBED EM
ROLL FUCKING TIDE BABY
INTERCEPTION LMAOOOOOOOO
Wut 
Wut
no
Thug life
How''d you get a GMU flair if they don''t have a football team 
WHAT
ESPN looking pretty low budget right now 
what the fuck were those renders lmao
what a pick.
Minkah iz my father
Is anyone doing the championship footage with r/cfb game thread comments overlaid this year, cuz that was the tits the last two times.
LOL
Lmao what a start. 
OH SHIT
Fuck man he had him
YEAAAH!
Oh no 
I've seen teams fuck that up before. Where they'll elect to "kick" instead of electing to defer or elect to kick after the other team defers.Like, I've seen teams fuck that up on TV. I'm not just talking about high school ball.
That was a hell of an int!
Nice.
https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/salt_pour1a.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200
FUCK
Wow
What?
I hate Tony Brown 
Just remember UCF are the real Natl. Champs, this is the loser bracket.
I''d actually like that even though there''s not a real purpose for it. I get so hyped for the playoffs and then only watch 3 games 
Like HQ trivia 
Jaysus
Wowwww
What the fuck
What just happened
OHHHHHH WTF
Wow wow lol
Any good radio station in the bay area giving play by play?
what the fuck lmao great pick
Welp.
No wonder uga fans are so poor. They spend $1000 on tickets /s
GIMME THAT SHIT - Tony Brown
That was fast.
Holy shit what a play

How does that end up being intercepted. Fuck it here it comes. 
Haha damn. That was a good catch and steal too 
TONY BROWN! OH MY GOODNESS
Not a good start.
INT
I'm just here for the fancy ESPN graphics.
I wasn''t expecting to see Matt Luke on the Coaches Film Room. 
Hahaha you've got to be kidding me.
Ripped out holy crap
OH BABY WE GONNA GET SOME EARLY COBRAS?
Wow what an interception. 
Dilly Dilly. 
NIOCE

BY GAWD JR
Not if I can help it
He was like gimmie dat
Brown wanted that pick bad 
Whoa

SNATCH
Anyone getting a shit ton of lag from WatchESPN? Making me wonder why I pay for it and don't just stream.
**yay**
Wow, he just ripped it away.
I wish they kept it on Dan and Stu
This isnt the defense to float balls against Fromm
How do you catch it and then give it to the other team?
Bad throw and bad receiving
That was awesome
Great play!!!!!
Yes!!!!
Can I remove these side screens. Not like id want to see the game or anything.
whoooo
Hot potato.
Oh lawd 
What the heck
Underthrown ball... a good throw and that's a TD.
Holy fuck dad dicked him
Oh shit...
Oh that was something!
O shit
FUCK YES!
Damn lol, he made that ball his.
O/U number of mortgages sold to go to this game
How lucky is he?  Never even turned around lol. 
Those graphics NCAA '18 CONFIRMED?
I love the Coaches Film Room, but I'd wish they'd speak more clearly, they're kinda mumbling and its hard to understand them
Athleticism 
Goddammit
gg
I've driven through Atlanta, 0/10 for traffic. 10/10 city experince though. 
FUCK
Shit, that's a great pick off
:)
He just ripped the ball out of his hands holy shit.
Well that's a bad start. Shit.
doubt it
So it''s gonna be that kind of game
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/salt_pour1a.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200
My God. Brown just muscled that shit
Oh nooo Georgia bby wat is you doing
Bama is a cheat code 
The defense is just unfuckingreal
That was a gift for Bama
Do we really want another one with all the Madden Ultimate Team card pack shit though? We can't trust EA to do it right. 
Holy shit. Brown just man handled him for that ball
Arm punt
Make my city and state proud dawgs 
just wow! lol
Bad throw. WR had the space to make a big play.
[deleted]
Wtf pls no
That play was a rollercoaster
whats up with the ps2 graphics
it was fun while it lasted 
Oh so that's how it's gonna be tonight
that was quite the emotional whiplash
God dammit 
wow
UCF is the only ranked team
GREAT DB play there
Can't be mad. That was a lucky INT
Oh, good, the WatchESPN stream is nigh unwatchable again this year.
Hahahahahahahahaha. The Empire strikes first. 
the fuck was that?
Underthrow!!!!
BAWH GAWD
I cannot believe that. I cannot. Beautiful throw, beautiful placement, beautiful interception. 
Honestly I don't know why I'm watching this game
THANK YER
That was great situational awareness by Brown
So it's gonna be that kind of night huh
Roll tide roll keep it going 
ALEX HORNIBROOK COULD'VE MADE THAT THROW
WHAT A PICK
jesus
The trick is UGA is going to want to score more then Bama
This live thread is fucking wild 
That was fucking unbelievably amazing defense. 
We're all Georgia fans on this blessed night
That man got robbed on national television
took his lunch money
Dude got straight punked for that ball
Roll tide
He legit just gave him the ball
I enjoyed that.
Things are off to a great start!
Stole it like he owned it.
lol
Lol okay
He had the ball too damn
I knew they looked familiar.
TD if a good throw that is 1 miss 
Weak hands
Terrible throw. Should've been a huge gain
LOL GG
0/
Fuck me, not like this
He stole that shit!!!!!
god dammit
Holy shit 
DOWNTOWN TONY BROWN
WatchEspn is garbage
UGA guy should've had that...
I know I didn't just see that
That''s a MANS interception 
I bet all of King Midas's silver that Clempsun remains a garbage institution by the end of this game. Check that.
HAHAA THAT'S THE WAY TO FUCKING START IT
He just took it from him
r/nononoyes
That''s not a catch in the NFL
Like that offense we saw last Monday could keep up with Baker Mayfield. 
Just think, someone got paid for that nonsense
TAKE DA BALL
Whaaaaasst! Interception yo! Whaaaaaaaat!
that''s such an Alabama play 
I don't want that WR on my team.  what the hell was that?
Man. What a play.
Argh. The coaches room isn't on /r/cfbstreams and I don't have ESPNnews.
yikes
What a start
I'm just hoping for a good clean game from both teams. :)
We beat State 49-10 so not them
What the fuck does that have to do with anything? I never claimed they shouldn't be allowed to boo.
"Gerogia knows they can't play in a phone booth."No team can, it's far too small.
Congrats to Alabama for winning the 2017 national championship 
Bad Doggies :)
I have a bad feeling this is going to be a blowout 
Someone arrest that man!
That's an interception, no?
BAMA!!
Classic georgia!
think of that as.. a punt
WE STARTIN OFF SPICY
Lol wtf was that
Hate how the Bama defense “swarms”. Take him down 1 on 1 like a MAN. 
IT HAS BEGUN
wtf was that
Fuck my life.
its kind of a technicality but they have to ask, team captains have messed up and said they will kick and end up without the ball both halves
Bad throw but gotta catch those 
The National Championship! Who isn't wet?
For today only, **ROLL DAMN TIDE**
Still, fuck Tony brown
I thought Fromm had a TD. Badly underthrew that
Not looking for the ball. Shoving him. No call
Hell of a play by the Alabama CB
Thanks and fuck bama
I mean, it's basically a mediocre punt. Not the end of the world.
ROLL TIDE!
Fuck all that. 
Damn it
Beautiful! Roll tide! 
Brown was flat out beat.
Two of my closest cousins are from UGA!!! Beat Bama!!!
lol
He just Eric Reid'd them
Oh lawd here we go
Lmao classic Bama luck
I can't believe I'm watching this. 
i saw Ray Lewis do that to Eddie George once
That's huge if Fromm just hits him in stride.
Uh oh
Yup, that's a pick
r/cfbstreams
Nice to see Alabama get a break for once 
Damn a pick on their first drive. Not the most auspicious start...
Is that even legal??  
I''ll upvote everything you post just because of your username 
Fell down and still got himself an INT. Way to never give up. 
Well game over 
These graphics remind me of mid 2000s ESPN shit, damn those were trash in retrospect
My dick enlarged watching him rip that ball away, so manly 
I'm here for the UCF memes!
H8 feeds the dog.
Hahahaha lol ya that''s the easiest pick you will ever have 
For everybody who's having the issues with Watchespn just sign up for a free trial on sling and cancel it sometime within the next week. Got signed up within about a minute and the stream is flawless.
It's gonna be that kinda game isn't it
ESPN: “lets have a in-game angle of the Alabama Waterboy''s head.”
lmao he had a chance 
Wow. What a crazy int
underthrow....but still. poor fromm
lol
Well we just basically lost
 That's mine.  Give it to me. 
Fuuuuu!
GO TONY BROWN
yeah, but they have TWO sky cams. Two of em. 
holy shit what a bad throwhe hits him in stride it's six
That was sweet of the Georgia player to give it to the other guy like that.
Can''t give Bama defense confidence. 
Fuck man what a pass
Fair enough. Saw some tweets that it was really loud, but there was nothing through the radio either. 
Probably shouldn't have underthrown that ball, but hell of a pick
That was one of those NO No no YES!!! plays. 
CRAZY TONY!
~~interception~~ muggingthat was hot
Well that was terrible. 
Definitely underthrown but also just dropped by wr. Should''ve still caught it
Auburn vs. FSU in 2013 was worse. Having two rivals in a national title game *really* sucked.
GIVE THAT MAN THE BELT
At least they killed our hopes early
That's all on fromm there, a better throw there and that's a TD
Damn
Now? They have been for years.
Bad throw by Fromm, if he leads the receiver it''s a huge gain at the worstThat said, that was some weak shit from the receiver to give the ball up
Why are they splitting the screen? I'm here to watch some football not these commentators!
Fantastic start
He didn''t win the fight if the other guy came up with the ball
NFL Ref: "That's not a catch."
hahahahaha love it
Dayum
less than ideal
Give him the turnover chain!
That's an Atlanta Falcons INT right there 
That was badass
Man I hate Alabama so much.
Wow 
Arm punt
Yeah so that Mega Cast is absolutely awful.
BELT!!
 Better throw and that's a TD. But still a really sad play on the ball by the WR
FOR EVERYONE STREAMING FROM ESPN.COM/APP/WHATEVERMULTI CAST IS NOT, I REPEAT NOT LAGGING.
I saw this :')
Hahaaa, that's probably more accurate than we think. "All these games get in the way of my game planning"
Any updates on team meteor's chance of winning tonight?
I mean, that's basically a punt.
*Best Teams in College Football*
WOOOOOOOO. LET'S GO
son of a bitch!!
I mean, he got lucky.He was beaten on that route by a lot.And it was a terrible job at getting his head turned around.But damn, that was a manly strip turned into an interception.
That''s a TD for Baker and Marquise, fuck!
Apparently, UGA *really* didn't want to receive the ball at kickoff.Bold move UGA. Bold move. 
Seahawks fans will say that''s a Georgia catch still
SEC football is better than none.
ucf had the only real chance
Damn. Defense showed up.
HOW THE FUCK IS THAT NOT A FLAG 
Awful throw 
lol yeah
Brown didn't complete the catch!!!! #nfl 
https://imgur.com/gmocXeYAnyway I can be saltier?
Alex Hornibrook should be on the sideline while Ferg made the pick
I have hope we are on the later part of the Alabama dynasty 
You don''t mortgage trailers 
More of this please 
Roll Tide!!!
THAT IS ACTUALLY DEBATABLE 
Sling is on a delay.   No spoilers,  please. 
Pretty decent punt from Fromm
The good ol' arm punt. Fuck!
It's a glitch I get it too. It says best right? If you refresh it is the new comments.
If Georgia is ever in the playoffs againLOL
wow
Horseshoe in ass. 
lmao what the hell.
No Turnover Chain? ESPN let me down
Arm punt
Roll Tide?
Introducing the 2017 National Champions, the Alabama Crimson Tide
Not ideal for the Dawgs
Uhhh what?
Dude from Alabama was all like “wtf, how did I get the ball”
Tony Brown-Greatest Headcase in Bama history
Wayyy to short a pass
Manhandled
Congrats on the bowl win Alabama!
GET IT T BROWN
TURNOVER CHAIN
HOLY FUCK YES
I hate everything already
Listen, the guy just ended up having the ball come into his hands. A better thrown ball and that's a big gain. 
#GIMME DAT
HOOOOOOLY SHIT
ughghhhh
I wouldn't call it lucky, it was a hell of a play
Sam Darnold is playing for Georgia???
OH MY HOWWWW
No sky cam on command centre :/:(
Holy hell that pick! Gotta do better than that Georgia.
Game over?
Troy Brown got bailed out of that one. He was beaten. A better throw and that's probably 6.
Anyone else have very odd static?
Nice analysis u/pickleindabutt
holy shit, T. Brown did something good.
TONY BROWN MY BOY
OH MY FUCK
You can't be doin that shit 3 plays in against Alabama
Wtf just happened?!?!?
Bounced off his helmet. Time for a stop!
Quite possibly the laziest attempt to hold onto a ball lol
ruh roh.
Fuck him.
Sigh......
These boys are so good :) best football to watch
Georgia receiver just got dad dicked. 
That ball was too damn high
Same
I just switched to one because it was so bad.
That INT was pure luck, fell right into his hands. 
B O I
lmao. he just took it out of his hands. 
Weight room right there
Yeah like the Kick 6
Well if Bama is gonna do this shit, I'm changing the channel.  I'm tired of these golden - horseshoe-up-their-ass turnovers
**INTERCEPTION VS GEORGIA****INCOMPLETE PASS VS PATRIOTS**
INT!
Bammer hammer already?
I really thought we had that...Wims doesn't do that usually. 
That is weak Wims
Is that the Imperial March that the baseline of the band just played?
Oh shit boy
This is making my eyes bleed and depressed
intercepting the ball?
That was... not ideal
that was such a strange pick. woah. 
There is no justice.
He straight up tore it out of his hands
"We have the two greatest running backs in college football history, let's come out and throw it three times."  -Kirby Dumb
ROLLLLLL TIDE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
No commercial yet? Shocked
What a play by Alabama
Easy ass touchdown and get bailed out by a bad throw
I fucking hate Bama. Let's go DAWGS
gotta catch those
See that ESPN is already hyping up the halftime show 
If you want to throw up, sort the comments by live and your eyes will start to hurt like they never have.
he just took yo cookies. Alabama already smells blood.
Yeah baby
Shitty punt.
Terrible angle
I for one am tired of the Big Dogs push.
energy is insane
I can''t be the only one who hates this half screen full of commentators bullshit
UCF wins!!!
No doubt.
lol then leave this chat
My friend just called Hurts "Caramel Jack Sparrow"
Wow, he threw that ball down rather quickly.  Most interceptions result in the person running across the entire field raising it into the air.
Can we talk about how great Baker Mayfield is for a moment?
Georgia fucked. 
It''s basically a mediocre punt 
Good first down. Capitalize on this turnover.
Gotta lead the receiver and it's a TD!
S E CPEED
damn that RB made it look like they barely even touched him
RIP good luck with this B1G ref crew tonight loll
Jalen Hurts is an unremarkable QB.
Don't worry little buddy, one day you'll be big and strong like we are. 
Snape kills Dumbledore
GO BABY
Bama doesn't have luck, it has the process
Best way to prevent wrinkles.
Can I switch over to The Bachelor yet
Arm punt
20 took a horrible angle to that tackle
SOMETHING SOMETHING CHAIN
UCF>Georgia
Final score 27-13 Alabama 
Well that's an interesting start.  FUCK
Best running back duo in the country. BETTER PASS THREE TIMES.
What are the benefits of a 4-3 vs 3-4
Great effort by the defender. That was some "its my ball and im going home with it" shit
O/U on Hurts passing attempts: 15
Anyone else about ready to lose it  because of this espn app buffering over and over?
what a pick!
Wow
Fuck you Georgia receiver
Anyone else watching via the Skycam stream? Pretty good views and don't have to worry about commentators. 
Backup Fustin Jields to take the field for Georgia on their next possession.
That was pure underthrown ball. 
Will they please stop talking about Jalen Hurts's phone.
Just got manhandled
well...what happened?
I for one Welcome our new Alabama overlords.
[removed]
that wasn't lucky.  the WR didn't make the catch right away and the bama db did everything perfectly.  the bama player was just better on that play
Under threw him, had him wide open damn
Daaaamn
Bad angle 
Well, shit. No problem, good call, under pressure made it a short throw. Good effort by Wims. Hunker down defense, stop that momentum in its tracks
Tony Brown sighting!
too bad they werent on the field :(
This is so cool my ESPN Radio TuneIn stream is synced up with Coaches Film Room. Unfortunately I Can't hear what the coaches are really saying. 
If this was the NFL, we'd still be waiting for them to finish up the review on the Bama INT
Alabama D can't beat you if they aren't on the field. 
>brownies are almost out of the oven!Aww that's nice>Gonna drizzle them in mayonnaiseW....what?
T. Brown has talked shit all season and he FINALLY did something worth talking shit about
Well that's not good. *Hello darkness my old friend...*
Chills
F this game. Let's go prop bets
Wtf was that angle
What the hell was that INT
Just dropping by to say fuck WatchEspn. This is what I get for canceling my cable to mooch off my family lol
Same
Too everyone watching on the ESPN app please stop so I can enjoy this game without freezing. Thank you 
Fuuuuuuuck
Georgia may be rattled.
He got away with one there though
how many souls does saban have left to sell?!?!
Look at Brown's fucking arms (for a CB anyway). The receiver knew there was no shot he was wrestling that thing back.
Hey, can someone tell me why Alabama always seems faster?
Jet sweeps, is Sarko Milicic back?
Ed Hocculi would have caught that.
That was odd for sure
The fuck is this shit? Tiny screen ESPN football for a national title game.
Jalen Hurts looks like he would play Achilles in an all African-American rendition of The Illiad
Fuck WatchESPN
Tony Brown gets beat badly and ends up with a pick LOL
Georgia D looking slow so far. 
Can already tell this game is Bama'sThey got that SEC SPEED
I mean DB was beat. Just under thrown ball. Good play by the db to recover, but he had to have help from a bad throw.
I am pissed. Royally pissed. I had to throw away a container of black cherry ice cream because I ate out of it when I was sick. That shit wasn't cheap.
what the fuck
Who do you replace Saban with though? That''s going to be hell on earth for a job.
bruhhhh snatched it like nothing 
I already am not happy.
If georgia doesn't score more than Bama then they will have a tough time winning this game
Decent arm punt
I prefer the term "glorious" personally. 
Not likely
Current Score:Alabama 0Georgia 0UCF 7
excellent arm punt
>new
Drink every time we hear/see Hurts' iPhone wallpaper
does anyone know what happens to the commemorative coin they used for the coin toss after the game is over?
You got a hotpocket as a flair?
Pass interference???
Hey big man. Lemme borrow that. 
Feel bad for jake Fromm there. Not the perfect throw but that pick was far from his fault.
Bama coming out fast.
Great snag by Ridley. 
no prob!
Oh so they're not choosing to not choose, they're choosing to receive in the second half?
When will there be a fight? 
He didn't look strung out to me...
Even your burito flair?
Alabama has too much talent
Georgia has O chance of even covering the spread
Get off reddit and watch the fuckin game then
##TeamMeteor
Arm punt
i feel you
Jesus Christ, great catch by Ridley on a terrible throw.
Good lord he ripped that ball out
I am pissed. Royally pissed. I had to throw away a container of black cherry ice cream because I ate out of it when I was sick. That shit wasn't cheap.
Video game catch
Jesus calvin... what a catch
But paaaawwwwllll
SlingTV>>>>WatchESPN
If that was the NFL the INT would have been ruled incomplete because he intentionally dropped the ball when he got up and they'd say he didn't survive the ground or some bullshit
People wonder why Alabama gets the benefit of the doubt
new?
Terrible throw but of course Ridley makes a hell of a catch
Oh no
I''ll take 1 Saban soul please
I didn't know Will Smith's son played QB for Bama
100-0?
"I'll try throwing, that's a good trick!"
I'm assuming we'll have new threads for every quarter?
They will make up for it 
Basically, it's the team where you hope something catastrophic happens (like a meteor hitting the stadium) and they just redo the whole season without either of these teams. Mostly a joke. Mostly.
Georgia has diagnosed every play so far, and failed to execute
Jalen hurts looks 30. Easy. 
You might not be watching the main broadcast. It''s on ESPN. 
How did Disney clear this CGI?
Same models with different numbers lmao
Nice graphics Xbox 360.
The South is the best region when it comes to football, northerners btfo.
2 minutes in and Alabama still has like max momentum
Now just make smart play calls and drive on down the field, pawl.
has it OD'd?i'm watching on cable thankfully
I agree
What is with this weird CGI lineup. 
ESPN, why do you suck at broadcasting every football game ever?
Tide is starting strong. 
Lol what is with the animations 
I am. It''s a damn travesty.
Well then you should've beat them when you had the chance.
That Calvin Ridley catch deserves a replay. At his shins running away from the ball.. sheesh
WatchESPN is horrible
Ball hit the Bama defenders helmet. He got lucky as fuck. 
I volunteer as tribute.
Does this game look really HD compared to usual or is it just me? 
Loving all the delayed illegal streamer comments
I prefer the sounds and sights of the game stream for that, as it doesn't just do skycam angles.
This is gonna end bad
what the fuck are with these ps2 like introductions lol
I like their chances if they can score more tho. 
Getting tossed like cheap salad right now.
what's with the weird animations of the defenses?
....new?
These ESPN graphics and renders are fucking terrible.
The Matt Ryan effect
NCAA 18 Confirmed with these graphics
They really need better animators lmao
This is last week all over again. Wake uuup!
*THE ALEX HORNIBROOK THAT PLAYED IN THE ORANGE BOWL COULD'VE MADE THAT THROW
Bama is gonna win by 50 aren't they :(
I'm not sure if I should be raising my pitchfork at ESPN or Hulu but this is ridiculous. 
This is going to be a blowout, isn't it?
Ok Alabama, keep them on their heels. Looks like offense is going to play Alabama strong.
This is where Alabama kills you. You may be the better team in terms of ability and stats, but they''re just more athletic than you. If they can''t outplay you they will just outrun you. 
Fuck, Bama gon win this
Jalen Hurts is trash
Let''s go Cena!
Man there''s some downvote trains going on
Whoa PS 2 graphics
I don''t like this game so far
Playstyle more than anything else. 
Wait where's Trenton Thompson?
Hey AZ fam cheers 
These graphics remind me of a WWE broadcast
Skycam is awesome
That attempted tackle on the sweep is exactly how Georgia can get in trouble. DB tries to come up and make the hero tackle for a loss instead of just doing his job and continuing to force the play to the sideline.
Someone on my TL says she is rooting for Georgia because of the SEC East. And she is a Gamecock fan.
The entire stands in the third quarter, probably.
I don't care if you have Herschel Walker and Barry Sanders. If you're not connecting with a receiver that open, you are not beating Alabama. 
That would have been a TD against us, lol.
Yes, yes he really did
Am I the only one bothered by Jalen's dreads starting at the middle of his head??
Lol @ guy in front row with the Atlanta Falcons sweat shirt.
Saban puts something in the water 
I'm rooting for overtime. I'm always so sad watching the NCG. It's all over after this my friends. Another season come and gone :(
1 vs -1
Hey guys, when is Kendrick on?
Georgia wants Bama. Yikes
That playcall was beautiful. Kiffin would've never done that
I don't understand why they show the team's players like they're not real people.
Alabama is going to win by 50
Katie Nolan is so annoying on this. At least Bomani knows who Hurts is 
He''s on to sacrificing animals. 
It's funny how they keep trying to show all these cool 3D graphics and animations and they have to cut right back to the game. 
But... If Georgia's also in the SEC, should they have that SEC SPEED too?Scientists are baffled
Put Eason in
MORE POINTS
It''s those brand new stadium cameras boi
I hate Jalen's hair so much
Why does Disney put this on ESPN? Can they really not delay shows coming back one extra week and put this on ABC? At least until their stream is up to 2018 standards.
The Bama player was lucky it was underthrown though--in stride that was going to be a very long play.
Lol mines mostly 0 fps
All hail our overlord Nick Saban. 
Yes
The Sounds of the Game stream is pretty cool. Gets rid of the announcers and doesn't lag.
No it''s perfect
The fuck are these player graphics?
Doesn't look good for uga 
Was that a stiff arm turned facemask?
That was my first thought, almost looked liked he dropped it at first with how quick that was
What's wrong with it? I see a ton of hate 
Of course I can't login to watchESPN because the login services are down. What a piece of shit. 
Ok that was a little low.  And the entire Alabama team is playing like they're coked up.  They're gonna lose energy at some point 
If we can get a game anywhere near as good as Georgia Oklahoma I will be so happy.
well i am forced to choose between watching the game on tv in 480i or on watch espn that's HD but buffers every 30 sec. I hate my landlord
What a catch... wow
These 3d players are atrocious. 
How did they circumvent using player likeness?
Top five at least.
You guys think we'll see a ncaa football 2019 commercial tonight
Ouch. :(
Was that Bortles out there?
Georgia may have closed the gap on Oklahoma but if they get down in this game they're probably fucked.
So it''s basically Bama vs Bama? This game is just credit to the Saban dynasty
their graphics for the defense make the DL look really fat
This game is getting out of hand, now time to watch cats playing pianos
We don't run it at all? lol
I've seen this game before
No chance.
Melt it down, boil the germs away and refreeze. Simple
Stop with the animations pls
fuck I don't like this :(
Did they hire that weird Taiwanese animation studio responsible for clips like [this?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBL3ux1o0tM)
Could Uga have a worse start
I had a sneaking suspicion that this would be a Bama blowout, and all of our "Bama hasn't played anyone, therefore they might not be as great" was all just a hopeless wish. 
This game looks tiny
"YEET."
looool
Spu spu spu speed Paul... 
F
Let me know when UCF has 31 and Ohio Staye still has zero.
Why the hell would a parent name their child Roquan
At least Georgia showed they can make great defensive adjustments last game. Wouldn''t be too worried with this showing so far. 
How much were tickets to this game?
How is bama so fucking goooood
JT Barrett wants a word about being old. 
I feel like Jalen Hurts is a younger JT Barrett
Seems clear that Bama had a good offensive opening plan. Try to establish their ability to get past the edge. 
"This is what we played for, somebody hit somebody!!" 
Because they''re not. At least to media and the ncaa 
Pressure on the line versus pressure in the secondary.
Please
Mini heart attack
These graphica sure are something
He should step up into the pocket not go outside into the rush
Anyone else having their Watch ESPN stream freeze/stutter a lot? I have had no issue streaming all of the NFL playoffs on NBC and Fox yet ESPN's player never works. 
These player graphics are bizarre. I kinda like it though, reminds me of NFL Blitz
I am watching because someone has to lose.
Come on defense 
#\#TeamMeteor
"The H&R Block College Football Playoff National Championship presented by AT&T," presented by Dr. Pepper
YouTube tv is also great, 60 fps
Strikeout has been money so far. Best stream all season.
Run up in pocket Jalen
TL? 
Thanks for letting me watch this game in 480p watchespn
bands playing over one another already. gross.
<3
You the real mvp
Halftime.
The fuck is your flair bro 
ESPN quality
Preview of NCAA '18, obviously. 
Yes please, we all want to go to bed early. 
GG Dawgs
Time to lube up dog bros. we know the feeling 
And Winter is...well I guess its come actually
They are just interns not players 
i hate the idea, but seeing uga stomped, and then having ucf split the NC...  isn't the worst of results.
Apple TV 4K, Samsung 4K HDR TV, but with the Watch ESPN app I may as well be watching the game on a potato. :''(
Yes
This is the first legit reason for Salt I''ve seen in all of CFB
I''m watching in a hotel on a cheap Phillips TV and it still looks better than a lot of broadcasts on muchhh better TVs. It''s not just you. 
It's dope as fuck
After the Oklahoma game, I'm not counting UGA out until they're down by like 40
Looks like they know everything this defense is gonna do
Then shit posting season
Might as well
Those graphics make the D-line look like they are wearing sweatpants.
How''s WatchESPN working for everybody? Can''t tell if it''s just my internet or the streaming service
**anyone have a working stream link? mine is extremely laggy** please!!
We are not a monolith!
SUUUUUUUUUCKS!
ESPN has been using those shitty graphics for NFL games too. There was one series of shots of animated players on a playground. Who the fuck wants that shit?
Dammit I got drunk too fast
Am I just lucky or did ESPN fix their streaming issues?
Nice stop by Georgia.
Dawgs.... =(
must have outsourced it instead of using pixar or some imagineers.  
That's clearly Italian, man Alabamans I tell ya^^^^^^pleasetellmeIdontneed/shereforthejoke
Hurts is something serious
We are going to play slower than Alabama...they will never see it coming! - Georgia coaching staff
Hail Saban
Those CGI players look like Shrek in a uniform
The pregame CGI was even worse. 
You remembered!
Lmao blatant false start on Alabama was missed. The bullshit begins early.
Let's be honest, there's probably no one in America both rooting for Alabama, and capable of spelling the word 'Alabama.' 
This game isn't gonna be close I'm afraid.
loool I can see it
Holy shit people the game legit just started and y'all already saying it's gonna be a blowout. Chill out
Drink every time Herbie says "physicality".
I can't hear shit on the coaches stream because the noise from the game overpowers the mumbling coaches
Fuck watch espn forever and ever
You can't get your same cold again
I'm using it. It's working fine for me.
[removed]
The jersey number font on these graphic generations are garbage and wrong. They need to frig off
Technically yeah
Well duh. What else do they have going for them? They''re from the south, after all.
Why do we have a thread for each quarter? Since it was an all-SEC championship I thought nobody was gonna watch?/s 
WHAT was that snap
Whatever happened to just a simple photo or video of the player 
Put in Jake Eason /s
I'm the OU fan that had too much faith in a 17 point lead. GO DAWGS!https://imgur.com/gallery/o77x0
they are weird
I mean, pick 6 instead of an arm punt. 
Kirby absorbed his power
Live foosball. Like my mama always said, "you go play your foosball."
someone is jealous...
This has most of the prerequisites for a blowout.
Hey where that''s defense Georgia?!?!???
Just an obersvation. Neither starting defense has a white player haha
you mean I have to watch a whole half?!
These graphics are from Madden 4 right?
When''s UCF going to come in?
I love how red the entire stadium is
That's what Oklahoma said the first two hours.
Why wouldn't you?
I can actually order a pizza out here #blessHeres hoping this is a game worth watching.
What is team meteor?!
He's fuckin' set. 
Yes...
If Georgia's offense isn't having a coming to Jesus moment on the sideline right now they are screwed
Do i need to have Sling Orange (which normally includes ESPN) to watch or will Blue work (for some reason)?
Bama could've already scored?
They have an ungodly amount of stamina. Must of been part of Sabans deal with Satan. 
*Big boned
I signed up for sling TV for one week. For free. I'll cancel it tomorrow
In our dreams
 Check cfbstreams subreddit.
no thx
At a minimum.
Least you can even get past the error screen. 
Oh no, Georgia.
For some reason it looks better when the scorecard doesn't have the teams' record or rankings. Looks cleaner.
What do you expect for big 10 refs 
Good play by the DB but that ball was under thrown 
how shitty of them
How was a some dudes youtube stream from his house less laggy than the app of a billion dollar sports company? This is brutal
There's more chance of UCF winning this game
Hmph. I seem to remember similar talk a year ago.Too much football left for that talk, son.
Now that's more applicable imo
These lineup graphics look like they belong on a 2005 FOX NFL broadcast.
UCF should play in the second half 
Player introductions look like a..... new NCAA football game! OMG! 
Why is there a yellowish hue over this camera view?
On the bright side for UGA, they probably don't go up 7-0 first on Bama. That's the death sentence.
Dude there's like four different channels... You're on ESPN news 
People like them hear what they wanna hear man... 
How do you get 53 starts as a college football player?
This is going to get real ugly real fast. Georgia doesn't stand a chance
[who?](https://i.imgur.com/4fz8hbu.gif)
This is nauseating 
Don''t diss shrek like that 
? Just eat it
I feel like Tom Brady is a younger version of JT Barrett
Yeah they really need to turn the game audio down
It's frustrating to watch after you seen him do it every game for two seasons.
If the WatchESPN stream could work once for the first time in 5 years, that'd be great...
I don't want to overreact, but if Georgia can't start to play better defense, Alabama might very well score a touchdown tonight.
Is the stream horrible for everyone? It's unwatchable
RUN THE BALL
The lucky part is how it bounced around. Hit his helmet and then bounced between hands multiple times. The Bama db was also beat, so he's lucky it was an underthrown ball.
/r/CFBStreams 
Alabama's QB doesn't look like the prototypical Bama QB
GOD ESPN IT'S THE NATTY. Shit stream during the Natty.
I doubt you'd get sick again from the same virus that your immune system already beat. 
All I need is my free TSA precheck enrollment and 1 free meal per year at Applebee's.
can anyone explain the rationale behind only needing one foot inbounds to make a catch? It seems like it would screw over any wideouts with NFL hopes who internalize the one foot catch.
Damn, that's why he is the QB.
God I hope so 
5th quarter 
The game has been going on for 4 minutes 
You jinxed it
Did you learn your lesson?
If Alabama's QB takes a big hit, does that mean that Jalen hurts?
Jalen making plays
Stop it Jalen... it... it Hurts!!!
Ironically, Rutgers probably is #1 for that
Jalen Hurts channels his inner Blake Bortles
http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/500/980/61f.gif
At the half I think
FUCKKKKKKKKKKK
Jalen "BamaCam" Hurts 
Why does Alabama always have so many players with dirty brown dreaded ponytails?
I feel like overreacting and saying this game is over.
HOLY SHIT WE CONVERTED A LONG 3RD
GO ON THEN JALWN
It really goes by fast.
Yes it sucks
It's not your landlord...the stream sucks ass.
What will be Hurts new screensaver 
Anybody know who the sole survivor is in case of a surprise team meteor come back
im ded
Jalen Fucking Hurts
PS Vue on 120" projector. It's nice.
Huge hold
Alabama always has great/solid CFB players. Most don't transition well into NFL studs, but they're good enough to dominate CFB scene.
Fuck I can't imagine how boozed up I would be if my team was playing tonight
Fuck
Its like they forget how the Rose Bowl started for Georgia.
Mine goes from good quality to terrible quality to frozen 
class started today, have a 7pm on mondays
Hurts is going to win this game with his legs 
Everyone knows you cash in the MITB briefcase at the end. Duh.
These 3-4 defensive fronts are making me all tingly inside
How many viewers does this game usually draw? 
watchespn and sling are ushually behind.  i pay like 30 a month just for espn on sling.  nothing illegal.  they still fuck it up
Why does watch ESPN suck so bad this year? Never had this much buffering 
Major Hold by the running back
He had an open man for a touchdown 
> prerequisites
that's the laggy one that I am using. extremely unwatchable! :/
How could anyone prefer the cheesy prop bets opposed to the sky cam ?
They're the halftime show.
He literally said, "Georgia, you want the ball?" More of a statement with rising inflection than an actual question.EDIT: Fixed word
7 got held
Dohohoho
WatchESPN is ass my dude 
They have a 7 day free trial. I've got Orange, but I'm not sure if Blue works.
It Hurts so good
Holy uncalled hold there
I don''t think Georgia knows Jalen can''t throw
Georgia fans, now you know how we feel.
What shit execution by uga
Same 
Hurts is fucking good holy shit
This is going to be a long night 
Where's the QB spy, Georgia?
Still early and bad lucky interception 
Be good
Did you puke in it or something?
On that QB power, solid blocking by 77.
B1G was shafted 
I will buy the game for you if that happens
Get a free YouTube tv trial stream is good
Bam Newton
That would make sense.
Need to QB spy him
They play whoever is leading at the half
Nooooooooooooo (but it's still going strong)
[removed]
They already won.  This is for second.  
it is over 
guys gotta tighten up, don't let hurts run on ya all night
fire coach smart 
Oldie but a goodie
That's what happens when they both have -1 from the same opponent.
Jalen “Blake Bortles” Hurts
I wish *we* could run options ><
Hulu just got 39.99 outta me because I wanted to watch this game. I hope it's a great one.
Fucking held number 7 
Jalen Hurts is such a good RB.
Freezing every 10 seconds for you too?
FUCK THE WATCHESPN APP. FUCK ESPN. FUCK THE DAWGS. 
I knew he couldn't pass for the third-down conversion.Dude averages just over 100 yards passing in his Playoff games.
They looked shaky at times against OU and then figured it out
Play 13 games 3 years, 14 games one year
I doubt he told them he wanted to be on the field. They probably asked him.
I know. It's pretty wild 
btw guys don''t forget to UPVOTE THIS THREAD/r/CFB REPRESENT. 
I got YouTube TV and not looking back. I know if isn't everywhere 
ahh got command center working. Thanks! :D
Alabama moving the chains in their sleep
Logos still cropped smh
contain contain contain!
Are the Alabama pep band called Bamanarama?
Sign up for Hulu live tv or YouTube tv trial. 
I mean Georgia didn't really start last game well either.
Dude can probably still play
Saban has sold whatever he had left to the devil for this game
Roquan Smith with a great tackle
“Mr. Clutch”
Hahahaha mad props bud
Please
Kiffin's biding his time
Is the regular Bama center playing? Couple of high snaps early.
Is this going to be us next year with Fields.
2 more picks for Jacob Eason
The season ended last week, this is just for 3rd place
Please don''t blow out UGA then we really won''t hear the end of it from UCF fans
Every Bama snap has been way too high, Hurts has to jump for each one
My ESPN app blows but watching on SlingTV right now and it''s crystal clear and no stuttering or buffering. Get a free trial tonight then cancel. 
Four seasons of 13, 14 games 
use r/cfbstreams
Defense can't let that shit happen
get it? smart play calls? anybody?
Hurts need to work on his fake handoffs. He's fooling no one.
I had the same problem, and then switched to the Sounds of the Game stream. Not a single bit of buffering since.
My sympathies
Definitely looked like a hold on 3rd down
Way more people using it probably 
Hurts is the most likable Bama player in a while.
I do think it's criminal that you need cable to watch the national championship COLLEGE football game. This should be on free tv
Good man
I don''t get why they dont have a spy for jalen hurts he is trash at passing all he can do is run..
Tua.  If your reading this and you want to have a change of heart.  We are always here.  :)  That meanie Helfrich is gone.
No horsecollar in college?
Um, you're not allowed to overreact on r/CFB please calm down
Yeah especially in a title game, they may just let em play
Seems the alt camera angle ESPN app channels are more stable,  fyi.Skycam and no broadcasters for me,  actually prefer it.
Please keep giving Jalen those ez run lanes 
4th quarter when they''re one team is already beaten. Then we cash in our MITB briefcase and pin the last man standing
Can we just watch CGI football
um. these snaps are terrifying. 
In our wildest dreams
Yes he does
I started attending and then graduated from the University of Georgia. 
Somewhere Paul Finebaum is probably furiously fapping with a belt around his neck just reading SEC hate tweets while watching this. 
Tulsa in the Natty let's go.
Ah ok, someone else said something about a YouTube tv trial.
Is Georgia about to pull a 2011 LSU?
Smith baby!
Guys - I'm not sure we fed enough H8 to the Dawgs
Jesus do the announcers stop talking at all other than 2 seconds pre snap. 
Gg 
The bits and pieces I can hear is great, I just want the game audio turned off
ya Georgia is fucked
Hurts makin it work mayne
Georgia plays good D 2 outta 3 downs then hurts makes a play lol 
Does Kirby just not prep his players for the first possession? Looks just like last week
No, you assholes don''t even realize it. Beating Bama led to this situation. The SEC NCG. If you just rolled over then we would have settled this a month ago in the SEC CCG. 
Always been the rule. One foot in NCAA, two in NFL
is ESPN's online streaming the worst ever? Yes, yes it is. 
Horsecollar?
Roquan have up that 1st. He was on his heels
You fucked up. You already have the antibodies, coulda ate that shit with no risk or remorse.
how many sure-fire first round picks are playing in this game? 12? 
Don''t have cable though :(
WatchESPN is basically unwatchable. Freezes every 10 seconds.
Hey man the main stream sucks. But try the hometown radio feed. Same broadcast, less people streaming it, plus hometown radio broadcasters instead of ESPN announcers!
ESPN's player sucks massive dong.
Yeah, might want to start putting pressure on hurts.
Honestly what happened to Bama vs Auburn?
Georgia came back down 17 last week just saying
Heh Bama comes fast.
It's certainly noticeably better for me than it has been, but I'm watching one of the alternate ones 
What?
Because everyone and their Grandma is trying to stream this game
R/cfbstreams
UGA''s linebackers seem to be containing the end around and spying on Hurts.
Georgia's lateral speed is impressive. 
I have confidence Fields is a better passer.
after clemson drunkenly stumbles in and smacks nick satan with last years natty trophy
yeah that's the story of jalen hurts
youtubetv free trial. trust me. stream is butter.
My tinder account said I''m getting more likes than usual, should I believe it? 
Hurts Donut
Wow, I guess the refs missed that massive hold.
Oof
12 regular season games over 4 years, a bowl each year, and natty this year. 13x4+1=53
Yeah I wanna know this as well.
Dammit Hurts 
Terribly 
Been terrible all season. Can't go 30 seconds without buffering 
Gary Danielson must be watching this one at home in his Jalen Hurts jersey
Same exact thing here :/
That was fucking close
Wow he had him
Good thing Hurts can't throw
wiiiide open and shit throw 
This game is over if Hurts could throw 
It's so annoying
Well that was a completely blown and wasted opportunity.
I wonder what cameramen get paid
LOL
Coulda been horrible 
JALEN YOU BEAUTIFUL BASTARD.
It's been pure garbage the last couple weeks, unfortunately
Yikes.  Not going to get more open.  
Wow.....
Georgia started slow against Auburn and Oklahoma in the past two games. Lots of time left. 
I really appreciate this “Homers” broadcast, with Adam Amin, Aaron Murray, Joe Tessitore, and Landon Collins. Really interesting. Like listening to a conversation of polite yet informed trash talk.
God damn it Jalen!
If you''re having issues with watch ESPN sign up for a trial of Hulu with live tv or YouTube TV. Both seem fine on their stream. 
Hurts has that vision, Alabama is looking tough to start
Ouch
Well, Jalen looks good.  I'm not shouting for Tua...YET.
Jalen Hurts is a doo doo passer.
Looks like hurts the only runner we've got 
ridley gotta rocket boost for that smh
Wow
Damn Hurts completely missed that
Roquan to the Raiders pls
i have chosen to take a drink every time Herbie compliments Hurts.      it's gonna b a long nite
DAMMIT
OMG
I just finished the national anthem on my ESPN stream and from the looks of the comments, I'm way behind
dam that was close
He was wide the fuck open
Thank God he can't throw for shit 
Georgia, don't drop your DBs 10-15 yds, create a 2nd D-line to cover the QB draw
That should've been a TD. CB#14 fell down
You say that... yet we''ll see them in the playoffs again next year
Holding much?
[deleted]
About tree fiddy
Jalen Hurts is an athlete playing QB
Kirby's kryptonite 
Hyperbolic and also wrong.
Jalen Hurts ran the ball didnt see that one coming... eyeroll
Still got it Jalen
Jalen Hurts so good
both QB's miss easy TDs
ehfnfenfodcoknkcndskcbdkcnkscbkscnb
Jordan Hare in November 
I know. I was more talking about the fact that I can't watch espn in HD on my tv
Scary af
watch one of the streams that isn't the main stream. Those tend to work a little better. I ended up having to do that for the Sugar Bowl because the main stream was SHIT. 
Literally can't even watch the game cause ESPN can't broadcast for shit. Freezes every 2 seconds. 
Perfect example there of jalen hurts not being a good passer
damn that.... HURTS. woo!
Ridley could have got that 
Dabo 
Why didn''t Ridley run faster for that???
Redshirt season, and injury redshirt season I guess. That's how you get 6 years of eligibility in other sports. 
No, I'm starting to have issues. It was perfect the hour leading up to the game, but once more than 200 people start streaming it starts to shit the bed.
Lol holy shit
Probably a million or so using that right now
I don't understand how the rule screws over nfl wide outs. 
got away with one there, lol
Saban defaulted on a soul payment
Boy that's a TD with a good throwThat's gotta Hurt
Have to give your a receiver a chance.
The other Bama QB would've made that 
Hate watching is strong
Yeah don't eat directly out of the carton.
am I crazy or has Ridley been at Bama for 6 years
Little too much adrenaline on that throw
I think he played four games one year got hurt and got an injury waiver
Health, plus Malzahn had a great game plan, plus home field advantage for auburn. 
Saban's gonna chew him a new asshole for that one
If a QB runs like that and doesn''t slide down you gotta hit them hard. Make the afraid to scramble. 
I have a feeling this Alabama/Georgia game is gonna less like the 2012 SEC championship and more like the 2008 and 2015 ones.
Yeah what is this shit?
Nope
He's so quiet he's hard to dislike. But he's Bama so I'll manage
A lot translate. besides Trent, Lacy and Dee Milliner most are playing and at fairly high levels
Jalen Hurts, Heisman Winner
Watching this game I feel like an intruder has broken into my home,  held a gun to my head, and is making me choose between watching them fuck my wife or strangle my dog. I want to die.  
He''s a true freshman playing in the NCG commanding the offense. That''s insane 
what a terrible pass 
Every time my stream pauses I have a semi heart attack thinking it''s been removed 
I like that Jalen didn't dance around and get tackled short of the first.  Instead he charged full speed ahead to power for a couple needed yards.  I feel like too many QB's try to style that kind of play.
Ty
Just tuned in, what'd I miss about Baker?
Honestly, it looks like Ridley slowed down or stumbled. That's not all on Hurts.
No.
:( Sorry bud. I had the same problem with the semi-finals. It's incredible that a company owned by fucking *Disney* whose only point is to show sports can't put out a reliable stream for one of the most popular sporting events of the year.
Interested to see how Fromm responds after that pick. 
ESPN's stream is such garbage I honestly don't understand it.
High snaps, third and fumble incoming.
I really hope Ridley gets drafted by a team with a quarterback.I think he's going to be really good.But damn, I just want him to have a quarterback who can reliably get the ball to him.
The second he left his hand I knew that was a terrible pass
Bro you had him wide open. Just run the ball Jalen
Jalen is doing work but no way he can keep that up all night. 
there we go D
He thinks Saban is still coaching the dolphins. 
Try Sling TV next time. Cheaper, I believe.
Oh wow. I just noticed. They're hitting him right in the 6" over his head.
Why go for Peyton Mannings when you can have a team full of Tim Tebows?
that's not a play to miss in the natty
Kk so Jalen still can't throw. Just wanted to be sure lol
12 regular season x 4 = 48. Possibly 3 more games per year. And you could have medical redshirts and play 3 games in a season.
JT Barrett had atleast 100
Good hold D
has to be between the shoulder pads but that was enough on the side
Only if there is a horsecollar...
I am going to be refreshing my drank often during this game.  
great hold D
I may be a little late in my overreaction, but I'd like to congratulate Oklahoma on their national championship regardless. 
now that we're doing 10 different game threads, there should be one for people watching on TV and those watching a stream 10 minutes behind 
Jalen Bortles.
Good stop there for Georgia 
Go for it Saban!
FIELD GOAL INCOMING
Roquan Smith is an absolute beast. 
I told myself I would use my laptop to work on job applications while watching this game. Guess what I'm doing with it instead
I think I'm gonna wear my GA Tech shirt to work tomorrow.
facts
Jalen PLEASE
k 
That Darth Maul tho
Who the hell was that pass to?
Fuck it go for it. 
i would gladly take streaming in 480 instead of HD if that was an option to allow the stream to work
My god...
The ones that aren't the main broadcast seem to be better
I feel like Hurts and Bozeman are .25 of a second off on the snaps. 
Alright Papa, pls 
BLOCK THAT KICK
HUGE break for uGA there
This stream is ass, anyone having luck with the alternates?
Calling it rn, the kicker chokes
What on earth was that costume...
Have to make Hurts throw it.  He sucks at throwing.
Whiteface
I''ll take it. 
I didn't know Ridley was freaking 23 years old.
block please?
Can't believe hurts missed that
ALL YOUR H8 IS BELONG TO US
Saban is gonna eat Hurts' heart.
IS Joey Freshwater on one of the megacast channels? I wanna hear his perspective of the game.
He tripped and the other dude stumbled. Ouch
Jalen "Not Peyton Manning" Hurts
Saban “Gahhhdd DAMMIT” 
Huge win there for UGA keeping them to a FG
"Dual Threat"
He needs to make his way to Dallas
That.....Hurts....I'll show myself out.
Jalen's passing megahurts. 
This game about to be lit!!!
On cable or the WatchESPN app?
Not sure if this drive ended because of GA, but I hope they get a block.
WHAT RE YOU TALKING ABOUT BAMA HAS HAD 1 POSSESSION IT'S OVER FOR UGA 
You mean the Alabama invitational?
Wtf is Georgia doing
oh shit we just got lucky with that.
How bout that kickoff a minute ago?
Alabama is also better than Oklahoma
Did anyone just see those two kids with extreme black face? Wow
man if only hurts could pass, 
Qb pls
Okay this dudes kinda trash
From the local African Tribe.....the Black Bushwhackers. 
Auburn had Alabama mapped out. Homefield advantage. Injuries played a part likely.
Nevermind.  TUA please.
Another one
Alright held them to 3 good job boys let''s get the ball back
I would love to see Roquan Smith in a Packers uniform next year
*he's undersized at 5'10*I'm trying to get past 5'6 st the age of 26 #y u do dis to me life
Just think georgia has some jitters. Alabama came out pumped and they seemed a bit flat. Get a couple hits in and they'll be alright.
It's really hard to play well in our stadium when the crowd is pumped.
Undefeated in playoffs
We're about 15 minutes ahead of that
HOLY FUCK THAT GUY IS 6' 6' 245?!? holy fuck.
Damnit there goes a TD.
black guy in black face and some sort of mad max outfittrying out for Raiders fan of the year?
Hurts is an RB that sometimes throws. 
I hate Georgia fans, first time I've ever rooted for the Tide
Honestly I don't think it was a fluke. I think Bama really was the worse team there. But Saban is such a good coach that he got his players to wake up and fix all their issues afterward
needed that stop hot dam
Hey man the main stream sucks. But try the hometown radio feed. Same broadcast, less people streaming it, plus hometown radio broadcasters instead of ESPN announcers!
You think those fans do cocaine and yell “GO DAWGS”
Thank you, Zo!
Working hard?
God damnit Jalen. 
Andy plays with his toys
Watch ESPN turned me into a criminal- gave up on it and watching a stream now and it's night and day difference
ohhh okay that makes sense. sorry, im more of an nfl guy. so switching allegiances isnt common. especially not when a team has had recent success.
uHHHHH jalen just run dude
damn
Nothing, they're actually talking about the players who are playing in this game for once.
That missed TD would kill me if I was a Bama fan.
Where''s that creepy guy that broke down on the way to California?
Is that a Greek name?
Fucking Hurts had the dude wide open in the end zone all he had to do was throw it into the end zone. 
Easy, let them fuck your wife.  Next question?
https://www.reddit.com/r/CFBStreams/My dude
Hurts is bad at passing gg
We're working the concession stands, ready to jump in when one team starts hurting.
Ya he can man
Not if you also pull with the other arm on the body. 
Lol he''s going to miss 
yo that throw was trash
Fuck ESPN. This is ridiculous.
Bama fans, how common are Hurts overthrows like that?
People saying Georgia is fucked: did you not learn last week?
yes! push them back
H8 feeds...
If hurts could throw that offense would be unstoppable 
The Road Warriors have really changed.
This thread is moving too fast no one will notice I would eat Jakes ass
Defender got lucky as hell
Got lucky there.
Georgia defense has arrived
It was an illness that required a 10 course on antibiotics.
Nah you can grab it as long as you tackle the guy forward. 
That's the stop we needed defense, way to go
"Those gee golly gosh darn college educated hooligans!!"
[deleted]
BLOCK THAT KICK! FUCK THAT SHIT! BLOCK THAT KICK:
good to see Darth Maul in attendance 
center got nerves?  
Agreed it's almost made the game unwatchable
Seeing those Georgia fans reminded me of the [OG Georgia fan.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahZOVLWr31k)
wow. that was a touchdown.
People think Bama fans are obnoxious, but if UGA wins, as someone who grew up in ATL, you guys havent seen anything yet.
good we get to rely on our kicker
He's such shit.
no way he makes it now lmao
Dude has dildos on his shoulders...I dig it
Apparently youtube tv is pretty solid and offers a free trial
The fix is in already ^^/s
nice stop
For real this is awful.
ESPN's shitty infrastructure. It was flawless the hour leading up to the game and now it's quickly going to shit with audio cutting out, freezing, and serious pixelation.
A Saban team made a kick in a big game?!?! Oh nevermind, false start
Yeah, we are gonna miss it now.
Ayy
....reverse racism? 
Try /r/cfbstreams
Jerk off? 
Looks like we''ve got ourselves a good, old fashioned, kicking contest. 
I noticed 
I'm surprised they're making us look at Landon Collins and Aaron Murray talking on the sidelines all night. Do we really have to see them speak?
well fuck me sideways...please just give us the few kicks we achieve
Had to stream the games last week, tried using espn3 and it was always laggy. I just went to stream2watch and it worked waaay better. 
Same...but it counts if the job app is open in another tab. 
As soon as we start throwing a lot we get 4th down. Daboll come on...
Noted
Apply for Arizona Head Coach!
The Alabama bowl sponsored by roll “tide pods”
Ah, thank god, I hate Baker anyway.
Nice.
Oh God. If this comes down to FGs....
Kick it again 
Hey man the main stream sucks. But try the hometown radio feed. Same broadcast, less people streaming it, plus hometown radio broadcasters instead of ESPN announcers!
undersized for the NFL.  you're good bro
It was a Road Warriors costume. Smfh. Youngins don't know the classics.
Gonna miss it now
I SEENT IT
If you measure his frequency, you'll have Jalen Hertz.
This love it or list it episode is pretty good. They just ran into some structural issues that is gonna wreck their budget. 
what's happening, the espn streaming isn't working
Watch this chat calm down as people decide that they shouldn''t stay up for this
Nah, That aint how Watchespn works.  
I noticed. 
I like this I'll have to keep it in mind for the future and thanks for the explanation 
ok ok. good. I was starting to get worried.
That's Jalen
Hold them to 3 Dawgs
I noticed 
Well here it comes, wide left 
block pls
Wow that was a nice fake there by the UGA player 
Ehh idk bout that
I see you fam.
What's up with Alabama's snaps?
Nice try
Probably
Thanks. I knew there was another program,I just thought the game was on ABC for some reason. When I realized it wasn't shortly before kickoff I couldn't think and just grabbed whatever the hell I could find.
FYI to everyone, if you dont need or want the commentary, you can stream the game free from ESPN with no login or bullshit reqiured:http://www.espn.com/watch/_/id/3267580/sounds-of-the-game-2018-college-football-playoff-national-championship
You can grab it as long as you tackle them forward. 
I''m so tired of Jalens passing game. It''s just garbage.
So for UCF fans, should we root for Bama? Guessing that gives us slightly more credence ??
Yay for the stop!
I seent it
Not fast enough
One of our basketball players did something similar. Not sure what he ended up changing it to... I'd assume something from the championship last year but I don't know for sure. Maybe I'll have to ask him.
Is Galloway calling this? No sound
I feel bad for the UGA band members who have to hold that loud note for so long every other play
...we're fucked.
Hate to break it to you, but I think you're done growing by 26
lol yea that was... interesting
I'm confused and a little disturbed by your flair.
It's a Bama tradition.
I'm a little behind, but amazing concentration on that pick
That... Hurts
Oh good throw the ball away Jalen. 
Please let this game pickup. I'm too drunk for fg's
Ok
ah, the traditional missed field goal 
HAHAHAHA
Jalen hurts is such a shitty passer its unbelievable 
Apparently the Road Warriors are in attendance tonight.
Oh, gotcha
NICE.
Sounds like ESPN has already crowned Bama national champions...
Yes
Holy fuck that was disgusting
oh baby
Is it common for the band to play between downs? I''ve never really noticed it until the semi-finals.It is so irritating.
It seems to be about 60% of his throws. But he seems to be pretty clutch when it comes to it 
Fucking jinxed it
Just a bit outside 
woot
god dammit
Yum
I hope you add some Tabasco. He needs the kick. 
Nailed it
Is the ESPN stream utter garbage for anyone else rn?
How hilarious would this game be if it was only field goals?
Smith didn''t even fucking jump
I'm dying. DYING.
Lol yes
I was thinking Baron Samedi, sans hatedit: whoops, I was thinking the black guy with the white facepaint next to him
Lmao nice 
YES!!!!!!!!!!!
Hahahahaha
LUL
Jinx
Find a fucking kicker alabama
Hahaha wtf was that
Not even close lol 
Yep, feared that. My exact situation right there :(

Ugh
How do you do that?

Well ok then
Yikes

There's that bailout! 
Alabama will never have a good kicking game. 
Man this Alabama team is loaded. I could see them beating the browns
AHAHAHAHAHAHA
What a rush.
Juuuuust outside
Fowler: Rarely misses from this range[Proceeds to miss FG]
Whys everyone so hyped about the SEC CG this year?

Imagine how good Alabama would be if they didn't have a RB playing QB 
Loooooooool
LOL HE MISSED
Is their kicker drunk?
H8 FEEDS THE DAWGS
Huh. Well this is not how I saw the first two possessions going. 
5 start recruits every year and somehow their kickers are always ass 
Pretty close
WEW LADS! 
whiteface? talk about racism and cultural appropriation(seriously though imagine the nuke that would go off on social media if they showed a couple of white frat bros in full "jungle savage" costumes)
This stream is great.
WELL IMAGINE MY SHOCK
just on here to talk shit or?
That kick PogChamp
Lmao Missed it by a mile
I have to admit, I really like Georgia's fan gear. It's no crimson and white shaker ghillie suit, but still awesome. 
lullll
Hahahaha fuck yeah
Wow. Hopefully our boys don't get shook 
Called that
And then God intervened and said "Not today, Satan. Not today."
Ugly kick.
Announcer's curse strikes again.
holy hell what a break. looked like bama was cruising to six.
Alabama field goal kicking strikes again
“Rarely does he miss from this range”
Amazing what 5 yards can do
lol
Shank a lank 
Bama missing field goals. As is tradition. The world is right now. 
Bama Tradition
Curse of the caster
FUCK YESSSSS
Nice 
Juuuuuuust a bit outside.

Ahhhhh!!!! 
THE ANNOUNCERS CURSE! I'LL TAKE IT!
W for Georgia early 
Saban just took that kid's scholarship. 
B A M A K I C K E R
He has been unclutch in the playoffs
They iced themselves! Haha haha!!!! 
I, for one, welcome our new UCF football overlords!
Heyyy
Hey man the main stream sucks. But try the hometown radio feed. Same broadcast, less people streaming it, plus hometown radio broadcasters instead of ESPN announcers!
Starting the game on a missed FG lol
Once again a wasted drive. 
oh shit.
You could just see that coming. 
Shank city
BAMA SHOOK
Jalen's our weakest link tbh
"rarely misses from this range" cue a miss.  georgia right in this!
that's how upsets happen
good lord.
"Rarely misses from this range." He fucked.
WHAT A MISS!!!!
What an ugly kick 
saban unhinges jaw and swallows field goal unit whole
LMAOOOOOOOO
That was ugly 
Has Bama been recycling the same kicker for the past 9 years with all of these misses?
Alabama kickers. About as reliable as a gas station bathroom condom.
Lol thanks for the jinx announcers
LUL
How do you fuck up that bad
What a difference 5 yards can make.
Jitters
If you want to win you need to score
fuck that was terrible lol
Get a free YouTube tv trial the stream is really good.
Bama still can't kick, cool nothing has changed.
Should have been 7, turned to 3, turned to nothing. Yikes.
missed missed missed!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
WIDE LEFT!good stand by the D, gotta sustain a drive now
wow
Fuck yeah
Hello darkness my old friend...
“Rarely misses from this range.”Fuck you.
The BEST IN ALL OF COLLEGE FOOTBALL
Lord that wasn't even close. 
VIGOROUS BENDING
CHOKE
Alabama still can''t kick field goals 
Goddamnit Pappanasty what are you doing
eesh
Oh boy!
There really is a God 
Oops.
Heh
 I am happy again.
It's so bad
Jesus, this kicker is fucking god-awful.
I enjoy using the stream to watch the game buffer every five seconds or in super slow-mo.
Wow. That was not close.
Goddamn papa nasty.
THERE IS A GOD
Oh my
Good call lol...
Ya I stream my games there, thanks tho lol
Rip 
Jinxed him...
Time to eat my own face.
Bro just forgot to adjust his aiming arrow.
georiga front 7 the real deal
YESSS!!!
I love our special teams 
that's what i've been saying all day
Waaaaay off
They do that at Michigan...
if anyone knows what they're getting into when they decide to stream th National Championship it's ESPN. They should be prepared 
Anytime a commentator suggests a kicker is great in a certain range it's almost always a guaranteed miss.
Alabama and missed field goals name a more iconic duo.
Do not waste this dawgs!
Trash
As soon as the announcer said "He barely misses from this range"... I knew he was going to be missing from this range.
missed by a couple inches
Just a bittttt outside
Holy shit, Hurts threw 1 interception all year
but you said he rarely misses from this range?
You got them Powerball numbers?
Bravo sir
Wait.....Alabama didn't do something....right?.........#god exists confirmed 
Awful kick. lol wow. 
God dammit WatchESPN 
Thank God for Bama kickers
lmao thanks papanasti 
Lmfao.
Maaan
If this keeps up, this is going to be the best worst football game in a long time.
YES!!!
Typical 
georgia got lucky there, did not look good on that defensive drive
Its usually an overthrow or,some other kind of problem. Guy just isn't a passer
I''m sad
Not the worst kick Bama has had
Rollouts never seem to work any more. We're going to miss the rekick again aren't we?
"**Rarely misses from this range...**"
What the fuck was that kick?
OH SWEET HONEY CHILD!
Damn that's good for Georgia
the nerves are high
HE MISSED
Great kick if the goal posts were 20 feet to the left
lmfao
> He rarely misses from this range.> \*shank\*When will announcers learn to keep their mouths shut about stuff like that???
Me likey
I hate papanasty
WatchESPN, unfortunately. 
Imagine if we actually had a kicker
I wonder what the crowd is like UGA vs Bama.  
The blue jackets are losing and I''m pretty sad 
Saban is going to have an aneurysm
FOWLER. SHUT THE FUCK UP.
First 5 minutes game ball goes Tom the UGA dude who induced the false start 
Fucking hell Bama -.-
After watching our game last week, we know the feel bama
Yee.
Fuck our bar has the homers telecast on
What a damn bailout for UGA
Hey man the main stream sucks. But try the hometown radio feed. Same broadcast, less people streaming it, plus hometown radio broadcasters instead of ESPN announcers!
That first kick was too perfect 
what a sad kick
Goddamn we''re gonna lose because of that right there.
Lmao, that kick was as shitty as Hurts throw 
Fuck man we dodged a bullet there
BARKBARKBARK
LMAOOOOOO
SHANKED!
What
This feels good. That''s was a big miss 
Why I'm sitting at the bar next to the most obnoxious asshole in the whole place
/#include <it.h>/#include <just.h>/#include <means.h>/#include <more.h>int getrand(int low, int high);int main(void)    {char *saban_dictionary[]={ "rat","poison","fuck","joey","freshwater" };/* Fuck it rest of program I'm drunk on my couch on a phone*/}
L M A O 
"He rarely misses from this range."
This statement could be applied to every play.
“RARELY MISSES FROM THIS RANGE”...proceeds to SHANK IT!
Georgia better take advantage of that cause you will not get that kind of a break for the rest of the game.
#pymfhbd
Fuck our kicker. Fuck
These high snaps may be a thing late
Rarely misses from this rangeProceeds to miss from that rang
Love seeing sad Saban
Damn. Bama won't get much handed to them, they gotta capitalize when they do
Wew lad*Kiffin grabs popcorn for this ass-chewing*
Wooooooooooooowwwwwwwwwwwww
Lmaooo
Dual as in both of his legs 
I love college football kickers. I'd dream of being given an athletic scholarship to be a kicker. Nobody expects much from you, but when you do make the kicks everyone loves you. A win win tbh.
Football would be so much better without commercials.
Why do announcers always do that? *right before kick or shot or pitch* "He usually does this really well...." *FAIL*
So why is it allowed for defensive players to do that? Seems like an odd rule. If the offense can''t goad the defense why can the defense do it?
Ok that was football. Time for more football. 
Alabama is crashing back down to earth after coming out with their pants on fire. 
Hey Saban. Recruiting kickers is probably a good idea.
What's more synonymous than Bama and fucking up kicks
Hahaha
Suck a fat one papa
I can't believe how bad it is. I might as well find an illegal stream
"He rarely misses from this range"*Ball lands four sections over from the goalposts*
Every. Fucking. Game. For like, *at least* 7 years.
That's a freebie
Man fuck WatchESPN.
Will we ever have a good kicker? The world may never know.
Saban's gonna kill someone with that look
:o
That was horrible. Damn.
Grind out a great drive, get stopped short of a TD, get a false start on the FG, miss FG.\#justbamathings
Really suggest to watch this on ESPN news it has the ALL22 cam
yikes
https://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/7p36ds/comment/dse7tmm?st=JC6YM2YS&sh=80927ea8
I don't religiously follow Bama football but have they ever had a good kicker? 
Go to sleep you are drunk
WE CAN BREATHE AGAIN 
My team will never accomplish anything. All I have are hilarious Bama field goal misses. 
Mark my words, that's the field goal that loses us the game
Blessed
Take advantage of their weak point! Make em kick
Nc state and missed field goals
I can't believe Alabama screwed a kick up! That never happens! Too much rat poison...
**SABAN ANGRY**
So are any of you non-Bama fans in their camp tonight?
let's just hope it's worth the money :) sure it will be. 
Lol Bama kickers
Oh man, daddy saban is gonna whip out the belt on his ass.
now THIS is walshing
Him saying it twice fucked us
Yes!
Very un-Bama like possession there.
HAHAHAHHA
Man that penalty killed Bama haha
Well this game might become boring lol
You come into our state. You try to be kicky bois. You cannot.
oof. ouchie.
I'm gonna be conservative and say this game is gonna end nil nil
Hahahahaha
Dude, it's cause we suck.  On 2nd down, we were probably gonna end up kicking and missing a FG
*Ring ring*You called it lol
Wide open td into missed fg, what a turn of events
Death, taxes, Hurts overthrows and a shitty Bama kicking game...
Calling it now. He''s going to miss another one today 
"he rarely misses from this range"
SHANK
Has pappandapas been playing longer than Barrett?
Should've. 
How can Bama not ever get a good kicker
Alabama and kicking troubles, name a more iconic duo.
Anyone ever figure out what a computer was?
Holy fuck I hate streaming this game and trying to look at this thread
Hahahaha breath hahahaha
Tell us how salty you really are.
Retweet from Georgia Tech...
Fuck my life
Why can we recruit 5* running  backs but not kickers?
dEfEnSiVe StRuGgLe!
Haha!Fuck 'Bama, y'all. :)
Some things never change.
Massive missed opportunities for Bama
You wouldn't know darkness of it landed on your face
For fucks sake- QB can''t hit a wide open receiver in the end zone from 20 yards, kicker can''t hit a FG from 20 years. 
Mmmmm disappointed Saban
They should have had an easy six if Hurts didn't overthrow a wide open Ridley in the endzone 
We have tired for years
OU does it every single time. Every... single... time.The Pride of the Midwest doesn't do that. But OU's band does... that's why they're not the pride.
7-1, triggering Brazilian Wolverines
lel
wow
Yes.
U
I''m watching the Film Room feed and the coaches are like a second ahead of the game feed. So annoying but I don''t dare try another stream.
Time to throw in a fat dip
what the fuck no
Georgia pls
Why doesn't Saban go for it more often?
BREAKING: Blair Walsh signs with Bama after getting cut by the Seahawks.
LOL
Blair Walsh'd that kick lol
Papa nasty being papa nasty.
Saw that one coming. His first kick looked a little off even though he made it. I knew he was doomed on the 2nd. 
Goddammit.
He's hotdog water 
lol
Are we sure Alabama and Georgia didn't get together before the game to make sure UCF is the undisputed National Champions.
The one game I went to they were tooting their horns at every opportunity. 
Alabama spends all their scholarships on 5 star recruits. Except the kicker. They just find a janitor on campus at the start of the year and go with that 
FUCKING ALABAMA KICKING GAME FUCK FUCK FUCK 
IDK, maybe UCF really is the best team in the country.
Kill me, first missed oportunity
Peanuts
Every Bama fan knew he was going to miss that second kick. Fuck 
He's good for 1 miss per game
Wow, the announcer curse strikes again.
Ugh Bama please don't let me down
Heeeeeeey! Choke kicker choke, hoo boy. Alright offense, you've got this. Drive this field and score.
Yooo he missed it thats crazzy lol 
FUCK YEAH 
If Bama could recruit quarterbacks and kickers they'd be unbeatable.
lmfao
LACES OUT, DAN!!!!
THIS THREAD IS MOVING TOO FAST
[deleted]
Foot AIDS.
How you gonna miss TWICE loool
Woah, did they somehow get our kicker?
Yikes 
Switch it to the skycam feed. 
They're called the Spike Squad. It's a thing.
Basically we are all pretending those two drives didn't happen.
ESPN should be goddamn ashamed at their streaming service 
Are there any teams actually known for having good kickers year in and year out?
Thanks Harvard 
Hurts overthrow. Fg miss. What else is new?
Bama kickers kicking like Bama kickers.  2018 is boring.
That kicker blows. He misses every time I watch him kick.
Beautiful Kick!
Hurts isn't good enough to win this.
That was a terrible snap.
Walsh'd it
lol announcer curse
Majority UGA
Hot Take: Jalen Hurts and bad kicking are going to keep Georgia in this game.
I can see why these teams lost to Auburn
lol what? alabama's kicking game has been inconsistent for as long as saban has been there
Oh so it''s gonna be one of THOSE kinds of games
Oof,dude is nervous af 
Go dawgs
They really love football here, don't ya know
“He rarely misses from this range.”  *Misses FG*
Can't you not bait a false start like that defender did?
Are we sure Kirby Smart isn't Alex Jones?
Watchespn has been trash all postseason. No better for the ncg. I've just used the sky cam stream 
ANNOUNCERS CURSE
1 minute ago I thought the game was over for GA, now I just know it is over for Bama. 
Please miss all the kicks you can
Ughhhhhh
Bama''s offense is trash all they have is a good defense.. i firmly believe oklahoma is better than them and clemson.
Many bands do. Especially OU. At least it's more noticeable.
I know they''re down 2-0
alrighty dawgs, we settled in now, now let's put that stank on them!
I am so happy Mike Gundy is with the coaches for film room.
They jinxed that shit lol
Kek
lmao when you get iced by your own team
That 46 out of 100We have narrowed it down by over halfAnyone know how many sims Georgia won when papanasty missed a fg?
I can''t believe you''ve done this.
What's it mean when raw chicken actually smells like an asshole? Was cutting some and had to throw it away because it smelt terrible.
just a bit outside
damn uga gotta feel good for not giving up anything
I'm not even shaken by this any more.
Alright alright alright!!!
HAHAHA that was some amateur type shit...oh wait
AHHHHH
Should've had 7... Smh
Ah, the good old commentators curse strikes again.
This game is a nightmare for me to watch 
"ugly from the start"
Now kith
Just to the left 
Chris Fowler is bad luck for field goal calls. Edit: Rece Davis isn''t Chris Fowler??
Wow, already crazy 5 minutes. Pappanastos shook.
Jesus, give Hurts a break he's the best option. Why do Alabama fans want him benched? Seems like he is a damn efficient most of the time
Everyone complaining about buffering and for once my PSN isn't buffering at big moments...i'll go ahead and assume I just F'd it up
Why do they make the hash marks so wide in college compared to the NFL?
I guess the rare is happening tonight
Is Jake Fromm a favorite for the Heisman next year?
Typical bama first drive. Get in field goal range and miss the field goal. We're looking just fine 
If Alabama loses this game it will be because of their kicker. That''s what stopped Saban from winning a national title back in 2013. 
"What the fuck man?"
All that murdering and fucking, and no sons.
Time to run the damn ball.
Nice jinx, Chris Fowler
**GOD DAMMIT**
I wish my team had your problems. 
Same thing kind of sortave, does it really matter though?
Remember when championship and all star games were on OTA tv for free
**MOMENTUM SWING**
so when saban made his deal with the devil, was part of it that he was not allowed to recruit a decent kicker?
Ahaha hahahahaha ha!!!
Both teams miss a TD pass? Jitters are on. 
Centers needs to get their shit together. Put it in a bag and fucking get it together. 
To be fair it was a 40 yard FG
That looked exactly like a Blair Walsh kick
Pappa nasty
How does Bama never recruit a proper one? Do they not offer scholarships to kickers?
LOLBAMASPECIALTEAMS
Bama kicking lawd lawd 
I thought the flinch the UGA player made to bait the offense was explicitly against the rules? Shouldn''t it have been a five yard penalty on the defense?
Baja got blasted
Alabama and bad kickers, name a better pair
Good god, you bama fans arent kidding about your kicker.
How does Bama always seem to have issues with kickers? How is Saban not relentlessly pursuing the best kickers he can?
Man I just want to see Tua on one series
Except when you get death threats for missing a kick
Auburn returnmen and the end zone.
Flair up
Nick saban wouldn't even have to yell at me to get a point across. He would only have to look disappointed in me and I would be devastated.
[deleted]
Nice
/r/CFBStreams 
That''s like Bama''s house words. 
The big 10 turf guy better be in a Dr Pepper commercial or we riot 
Fuckkk we can't throw, can't kick. Can't handle this shit.
**IT GOES HIGH****WIDE RIGHT****YOU KNOW DIS****SCOBEE o/`**
Dilly Dilly
already did. the stream I'm using rn is from them but its soooo laggy rn
GOGGLES IS READY!!!
nice work
Same.(Except that's a lie...Bama is way too frequently the lesser of two evils. -_-)
[J I T T E R S](/a)
It's like this always happens with announcers and the players doing the opposite of what the announcer is announcing
Bama used to be...
Rarely misses tho
Caster curse
Ok 41% Bama missed a field goal.  
Not a Bama fan, but accuracy seems to be 61.4 for the year. Not including this game. 
BAMA00UGA
Who would win: two uprights, or one kicky boi?
Nil nil? Where are we? England?!
They said it's like 70% Georgia fans 
Only every game ever in my experience 
Carolina Panthers fan here. Triggered.
Sorry. :(
Nebraska. It''s the only thing we are good at. 
We've had a history of great kickers and punters.
That was a bambard kick if I ever saw one
I miss Big 12 football. It'd be 21-24 by now.
Alabama's inability to recruit a decent kicker continues to astound me
Of course he fucking misses it.
Are we sure Alex Jones isn't Bill Hicks?
These simulcasts are cool and all but if they're gonna be on commercial too, then fuck that.
Keep us updated!
Yes
P A P P A N A S T Y 
Where''s that showing?
#collegekickerz
Lol
Yep
Because be cant throw he''s an athlete playing qb.
Only 6 minutes and my blood pressure is through the roof. Fuck me
Have you ever seen them in the same place at the same time?
It wasn''t like it was a surprise. The dudes at like 50% from 40+
They would compete. Smoke? No
for fucks sake. Same shit, different day. 
i think so man! but let's let the kids on these teams play, they've worked hard to get to this game
Yeah. That was encroachment. 
Deep State confirmed
how fucking sad is that? I hate this god damn website sometimes
I hope this game goes 0-0 for 4 quarters and they both lose. 
I haven't heard him talk about interdimensional child molesters, so I doubt it is him.
No one in America would just give away a free fucking iPhone to their friend, AT&T
These starting lineup graphics make me want another college football video game
p sure I could come up with a better kick given 100 chances....and no defense...and not 10 million people watching lol
Wow first commercial break..? I'm actually impressed with 15 minutes of play
I hate young people
Well Saban knows who he's sacrificing to the Dark Lord at halftime
Don''t worry bama, I''d also trade having a competent kicking game for unlimited title shots 
I see you
http://i.imgur.com/Mz7QaaS.gifv
I think I'm overqualified for that
I could see this game ending up being boring due to mistakes and overwhelming defense.
Jacksonville-Buffalo will be hard to top.
Why
How is it that Alabama more times than not doesn''t have a good kicker?
Unless you miss big kicks. That''s not much of a win. 
“He rarely misses from this range” *proceeds to shank it*
Alabama should be sponsored by tide pods. Roll “tide pods”.
That was terrible.
Hurts is absolute garbage 
Alabama do you miss Griffith?
You'd be better than #1 for the past 7 years?
And yet they beat your team. 
He needs pass protection tbh
Hurts will be the reason Bama wins or losses this game, he''s not a good qb whatsoever, can''t throw, and his pocket presence is abysmal if Georgia gets up early(talking 2 scores) they can win it. 
You can, its legal
WatchESPN is an embarrassment
No will see this but I hope whoever does has a good day and a good offseason! :)
How can *Alabama* not get a good kicker? You'd think that'd be the dream for a kicker.
Interesting first two drives of the game. 
LMAO these college kickers 
Thread is too fast D:
Go Damn Dawgs!
Blair Walsh, Marshal Morgan, Rodrigo Blankenship. We aren't bad. 
Over\under on how many days Papanastos survives if Bama loses by 3 or less?
I hate absolutely everything
Does anyone know what conference these refs are?EDIT: Jesus Christ, I didn't need like 15 responses. But thanks guys.
That looked like it was on the longsnapper. That snap was high and threw the timing off
WHODA THUNK IT
I hope midway through the 3rd quarter the UCF fight song starts playing and they run out like a WWE cage fight  
Man, if this turns into a kicking game, we're screwed.
LIONS SCOOP IT UP
I would give my first born up to have a solid kicker for 4 years..
YES! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHA!!!YOU JINXED HIM! Anyway...Go Georgia bros!
I had a bama girl shake her stupid tassel pom pom at me and say "we're better than you".  Ever since then, fuck bama.  
Clean field goal redone and jipped by a flag #justbamathings
Confirmed. Only bespectacled kicky bois allowed in da benz. 
That''s NOT angry Saban.You don''t want to see Angry Saban.
Georgia.
I'm surprised he was REMOTELY in the same time zone of the post.
Stop watching, please. 
Saban and Culpepper have multiple Super Bowls in their future.
Fuck lil sweet
whie are you not running? WHY ARE U NOT RUNNING GEORGIA? 
Jinxed
I love lebatard
Mine is doing just as bad as the official stream.
There is no point in commenting on a thread that is moving this fast
This homers cast is hilarious. Landon Collins just wants to watch the game lmao
announcer curse lives on
Diet Dr pepper commercials and my strange arousal 
*How to Jinx a Kick 101*
Can't be disappointed if you don't have any expectations. 
I'll take it, but we can't just wait on gimmes in this game.
Yeah on one of those plays Ridley was wide open over the middle and Jalen ran right and threw it away. He's got legs, but he has no eyes and no arm. If we had a real, elite QB, it'd be scary. Jalen often has all day to throw, but ends up scrambling instead.That being said I don't hate him, he's just not *great*.
Bambard vs Clemson flashbacks lol 
Half the room left forty seconds in when Georgia turned it over, the other half just left on the missed field goal. Oh boy tonight's gonna be  an interesting game
I feel like kickers have been the bane of so many teams in the NFL and CFB this yearl.
I swear Sabans kickers are never worth a shit. I just don't get it. 
Is joe Flacco and elite quarterback 
LSU and shitty QB play.....
Upvote noted. 
They should have signed Legatron
In high school we did it. Anything to help our team on defense but granted we tried to play stuff the crowd liked including Fortuna, Hey Song, our fight song (Notre Dame's), etc. I don't mind it but I can definitely see where some people get annoyed.
Has to get into the neutral zone
GET ME OFF THIS CRAZY THING
We should just forfeit now. Fuck.
10 yards is very generous. It almost hit me from an entire state away...
All 22 cam is great, wish it was full screen and they didn't dedicate half to boxes of the coaches in the studio.
B1G
Damn, 1 drive in and 6.5k comments in. Reddit's servers are going to melt. 
Fire Saban

It's so fucking pathetic how bad our kickers are

You can pretty much do anything except mimic the cadence as long as you don't enter the neutral zone.
Should've borrowed Michigan's kicker :D
Big 10
Haven't found one I can cast
Just used them up, sorry bro
This Dr. Pepper commercial is weird af
You're able to run and might just be enough tonight
Except that was from 40 and Blair Walsh was Money in college. 
Easy to blame the kicker, but the snap was high as hell and threw the timing off.
A S S   C H E W I N G S 
You mean Bill Hicks
Big 10
Nick Saban Hates Kickers is my new band name. 
I can also see why UGA beat Auburn.
That kicker is going places
That's the worst kick ive ever seen. Lol
Why is it our kickers always suck? It doesn't make sense.
Fuck you, Harvard
Every damn time
Hopefully the last?
It''s rotten lmfao
Offense can use hard counts and other things to try and force the d offsides
Big 10
Ours
I saw it too
Be Chris Fowler.Get to call College Football all season.Calls NCG.Leaves stadium and goes to airport.Catches next flight to Melbourne, Australia.Summer again.Call tennis for two weeks while eating lunch with Venus and Federer.Six months off.Repeat.
Shades of Bama LSU in 2012.
Nice Squib Kick.
UCF wouldn''t have missed
Thank goodness, it would be so annoying if that thug Tony Brown (who Saban should have suspended for blatantly punching an Auburn fan due to lack of self control) had created points for Bama
I noticed. 
So, the kicker can't kick, and the QB can't throw.... And Bama is still a ducking force to be reckoned with. SMH.
Put Tua in and never kick a field goal, it's that fucking simple. But we're gonna keep Jalen in and keep trusting our useless kicking game and this evening will be pure suffering
you cant simulate the snap count, like saying "hike" and shit like that, but you can move however you want as long as you dont cross the line of scrimmage.
He didn't enter the neutral zone. As long as he stays beyond the ball he can do whatever he wants outside of yelling out a fake snap.
Big ten
No. The kicker is always that weird kid that no one wants to hang out with until they realize his house has a pool
Is it just me or is the camera angle for each snap weird AF? Like too zoomed out or steep of an angle?
I feel so dirty rooting for Georgia.
I don''t think that Bama team would''ve beaten FSU regardless 
Big 10
B1G
B1G I'm pretty sure
That was uh...yea. Dr Pepper wtf?
Yeah they suck right?
She is into Donkey Porn. Such an odd ad.
one of the worst field goal kick ever
The announcer curse strikes yet again. 
Of course the ZipRecruiter guy picked the hot bitch
That's only if you cross the line. If you stay behind it you are good. 
The Shula years were true darkness. It just baffles me this team can't sign a reliable kicker
That chick is too hot to be talking to her cat
So which channel has the most interesting coverage? Sticking with basic right now but I'm curious as to which works and which doesn't.
ok we starting the game over now
Alabama kickers!!!
Why do "great" teams have ST issues? Ohio State's STs were dreadful. Bama just did that. Like it's 1/3 of the team?
Well that drive could've ended a lot worse for Georgia
Y'all can run so you have that going for you
Hey man the main stream sucks. But try the hometown radio feed. Same broadcast, less people streaming it, plus hometown radio broadcasters instead of ESPN announcers!
Thanks. I'll switch over at the first commercial. 
Jalen once again cant see anybody but ridley. Not liking this too much
Who tf is buying iPhones for their friends AT&T? What kind of economy you think this is?
I hate Saban. That's 4 down territory. Don't ever let a kicker try from more than 25 yards.
Man U
They should look familiar. Big10
Love how the commercials never have an issue on the app but the game is laggy and garbage the entire time 
that kicker is about to come up missing
Not that I'm surprised but this commentary is so much better than the NFL. Very refreshing. 
Bama is basically the Carolina Panthers
Raise your first born to be a kicker
Sad part is Hurts doesn''t RARELY hit a wide open WR in the end zone. 
I don't care for Georgia. Just want Bama to lose. 
NEC I think 
It definitely felt oddly familiar to yesterday lol
This is how it feels bama :/
Little sweet is just the worst

Military family, but I didn't serve. My dad was Air Force for 19 years.

Big Ten
She is low key sexy 
Mr Kick 6?
Of course the crazy hot chick is a ging
boom roasted.
Didn't enter the neutral zone, legal play.
There's 34,999 other students at Alabama that can also miss field goals for a full ride, maybe try one of them out.
Hes only being watched around the world, what pressure could come from that?
Jalen Hurts and the kicker are the reason I bet money on Georgia. Feeling pretty smart so far 
Ayyy
Because people are dumb. Tua hasn't played in months and has never played against a team that wasn't already accepting their fate 
T U AUA
You learn to accept it as a fact of the game.  Jalen will miss a wide open touchdown.
This is a familiar feeling.
Oh redheads.  So perfect. That cat is a little bastard though
Whoever came up with the lil' sweet concept needs to be shot, stabbed, set on fire, drawn and quartered and then buried next to hitler 
Bama bagmen should focus on a good kicker for once
this lady so obviously cheated on her cat w that dogthe lies are piling up how can she live with herself smh
The Alabama Bandwagoners are out of full force tonight 
I''m still not convinced Saban isn''t a charade. Is he ever happy?
Don't you mean "are we sure Kirby Smart isn't just Bill Hicks?"
I swear we have had the same kicker for like 12 years now. 
[The new Echo by Amazon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9Q72qYWxKQ)
Agreed. Kick-off after this commercial break.
Big 10
And that throw to Ridley earlier was fantastic if he was a few feet further into the endzone
My body is ready for a Turbo tax commercial 
They really should stay off your lawn.
dilly dilly
Youtubetv stream of espn is better than espn's stream of itself.
We fucked ourselves that drive
Why am I so jacked for a 3rd place game?
All 22 is pretty good.No announcers... YayNo replays... Meh
It means mercury is in retrograde 
Oof ow ouchie. My field gials
Looks like there are some nerves on both sides. 
B1G
Interestingly, if that Georgia defender was about a foot closer to the line, that would have been a penalty on him. Stationary defenders within one yard of the line of scrimmage can't bait linemen with jerky movement like that, but the defender was probably just outside that one yard mark.
You're better off going to a bar or restaurant that's playing the game. It lags and freezes every 10 seconds even when the Razorbacks are playing some shit team and there's probably only a few thousand people streaming. Probably millions streaming tonight so there is no way it will be smooth.
Is it me or has Alabama never had reliable kickers in past years?
Jesus fucking Christ how fucking hard is it to find a average kicker. Why are all of our kickers absolute fucking trash. Ive seen so many fucking important games put in danger because of them. I mean why do no good kickers want to come to a school with championship potential on a yearly basis. 
Just tuned in to WatchESPN, so I'm getting nothing but constant stuttering and choppy video. How does the crowd split look inside the dome?
Agreed. But we all will still keep doing it
Most want to run da bawl, but then want an NFL qb too..
We better hope Saban doesn't get his hands on the guy who committed the false start
They refuse to give up their Youtube channels.
B1G
On that 3rd and 8 scramble by Hurts this was a wide open receiver going towards the middle of the field right?
what about cable or satellite? :O 
Big ten
Literally never know what you'll get with them.
Why would it be against the rules unless he's offsides? The defense can move however they want pre snap as long as they stay on their side of the LoS
Amazing how Alabama literally never has good kickers. 
They done froze their own kicker!!!!
GEOR-GIA BROS! GEOR-GIA BROS!
Fuck. 
I'll second this. I just finally shut it off.
"My identity got stolen. Guess I'll talk to my cat, teehee. Why can't I find a man........." 
just throwing it out there but UCF didn't throw a single int or miss a single fg in the title game this year
You should do the free trial of YouTube tv. Working great for me.And fuck bama. 
Shut up I''m cheering for you. Don''t act like that didn''t frustrate you. 
To everyone saying "Alabama kickers and missed field goals. Name a better pair" the answer is chris Davis and his own end zone.
I think your chicken had gone bad.  It normally just smells like chicken to me.  It's a good thing you threw it away probably.
Fuck off AT&T
Seriously just spend one scolership and get someone good.
"He rarely misses from this distance"> proceeds to miss
Kicker seen Vicky Valencourt in his mind 
Anyone else watch espn u
Playstation Vue has the best streaming service in the game if anyone is looking
PURDUE TURF SCIENCE SON
Missed the kick because of WatchESPN was buffering. Thanks ESPN!
I want to see the version of that commercial where it's a guy living alone and talking to his cat
Who wins in a fight to the death? Lil Sweet from the Diet Dr Pepper commercials, or Nick Saban?
I wish they would've always show the all-22's. Seeing the wideouts running their routes give such a better sense of whats happening.
At least it wasn't returned for a TD. 
I don't miss Pac-12 football. It would be at the 14:30 mark with 20 penalties by now.
Would make UCF default natty champ I believe, per NCAA rules
Bama used up all its kicking attribute points on Legatron 
I despise these diet dr pepper commercials
Alright. Good warm up drives by both teams. Now let's get to playing Championship level football so I don't regret staying up so goddamn late.
Do we even have a kicking coach?
I'll wait
Good fucking call uggghhhhhh
Did he actually go to the neutral zone? It looked like he just twitched. 
Scott Frost wouldn't have missed that kick.
FUCK YOU AT&T. How many did you fire today?
Hello Wells Fargo, I did not lose that game to Bama.Thank you 
It''s not true I did not make that purchase I did naht
Forbath'd it(predicting the future ;P)
Big10
Why can't Saban ever seem to recruit a good kicker?
the film room cast is fun
Placekicking is our only special teams hole.
Not the NFL, but places 
KICKY BOIS EVERY DAY
Fuck AT&T
I don''t think Auburn fans appreciate this AT&T commercial 
Glad I am finally almost used to the CFP logo, so I can stop wondering why everyone is wearing a bible verse 2:18
Big ten
I'm watching Apollo 13. I'll let you guys know if Tom Hanks makes it to the moon. 
Holy shit yes!
Fuck AT&T
Gonna be a wild ride boys
Haha fuck you too
That''s something Alex Jones would likely believe
lmao
No you would not
its a nightmare for the whole country. I doubt anyone outside the south really cares much for these teams.
B1G
Bama with a truly elite qb would be scary. And yes that's the play I was looking at too
UCF's kicker would've made it
No? The defense can move as long as they're on their side of the line.
Run da ball 
Mods should have made a thread for every possession change. This shit is blazing right now
I saw it :)
Pepperidge farm members 
Yeah, you guys have really suffered in the past 4 years.
So you can go back and point to something you said
Only have so much of a budget.
Oh yeah, no hes not a real person
Bama can get any 5-star QB/WR/RB they want, but not a kicker.
I want uga to not win
I want to meet whoever designed the WatchESPN app and punch him in his stupid face.
Reminder: Bama special teams certainly aren't known for losing big games for us....... 
Fuck you, AT&T
Says the fan with the 75 million dollar man
Slide to the left, slide to the right, take it back now y'allCriss cross, everybody clap your handsClap clap clap clap clap clap clap clap
Can't hate on Diet Dr. Pepper though.
WTF was the Diet Dr Pepper commercial.
Can Big Poppa Payne just kick the next one?
Hey man the main stream sucks. But try the hometown radio feed. Same broadcast, less people streaming it, plus hometown radio broadcasters instead of ESPN announcers!
Big ten (B1G?)
Water is wet. The sky is blue. Bama cant kick.All is normal.
My understanding is defenders can bait as much as they want so long as they're not offsides when the snap happens. It's something of a skill that many defenders hone. 
Film room I''ve heard has problems compared to the Rose Bowl, but I''m really digging this “Homers” broadcast on ESPN2.
I see you, and I appreciate you
FYI to everyone, if you dont need or want the commentary, you can stream the game free from ESPN with no login or bullshit reqiured:http://www.espn.com/watch/_/id/3267580/sounds-of-the-game-2018-college-football-playoff-national-championship
> Whether you're watching on your phone...From the comments here it sounds like no one is successfully watching on their phone
In Stegeman Coliseum with the students and they hype over a blocked kick! I'm scared for the reaction to a TD
That Dr. Pepper commercial gave me aids
He didn''t even know the national anthem...
Not in a few years.
ikr, they're just playing second fiddle to UCF
I agree but flairup haha 
YouTube TV free 7 day trial. Smooth as butter
Lot of red
Well you''re not watching it on your phone or tablet because of ESPN lol
see Auburns Daniel Carlson
the world? c'mon, I like football, but few outside America care
Goggles WILL be the difference in this game
Alright, what's the overreaction to have here?
A truly amazing time we live in
Hey man, it''s not his fault he waddles a mile an hour. It''s Diet Coke and McDonald''s fault. ^^^^^^/sOn a serious note, I thought it was a normal thing for the POTUS to be in attendance at big games. I guess not?
Wrong.  Didn''t enter the neutral zone.
Classic Bama ugh 
They did that one year against Auburn, didn't they?
I haven''t sat down yet
let's go baby
My god he's such dog shit as a passer
Can confirm
Probably what I'm gonna do. I got about 30 seconds total of game in those first however many minutes. 
Part of me thinks they''re only under so much scrutiny because literally everything else about Bama is near perfect 
B1G
Somebody please step on the Sweet One guy. 
what is "complimentary" football
I take it back friend. 
what the hell is going on on the command center channel.
Yeah but we gotta be careful. Daddy Shea is gonna get some choice puns I''m sure. 
I wanted to hate that AT&T lady but she's better than the Verizon dipshit so she gets a pass. 
This is literally unfollowable with live on 
Lol Alabama sucks r/olltide
Maybe he missed it because he was buffering too
Lol
One game, we'll never see the Lil Sweet Dr Pepper advertisements again.  We wont realize that it went away, but it will be a beautiful day.
Alabama and bad kickers.Name a more iconic duo. I'll wait. 
Pat Fitzgerald may not have the best insight but he''s definitely the pinkest guy in the room
Trust me, we know
Ah yes. Games that are decided in the first five minutes, Alex.
Flair up brah
Alright, don't fuck this up
Oh okay I think the NFL rule is slightly different then.
New football video game would still be badass with these animations 
ESPN voodoo black magic confirmed
YOU TAKE THAT BACK, LIL SWEET IS A TREASURE
Georgia has for a while. Walsh -> Morgan -> Blankenship (though Rod didn't take over until a couple games in last year).
part of me wishes it were the PAC. just to watch everything burn
So, what have we learned from this drive? Daboll is stupid for passing on first down.
BAH GAWD THAT'S THE GOLDEN KNIGHT'S MUSIC
I bet the SEC wins
Dogs > Cats Not even close 
Who's playing the halftime show? I hope it's one of the boys from One Direction
The wells fargo cat commercial is just cringe. 
how much?  spread or money line?  im too broke to gamble these days but i need my fix
How the hell are you Alabama and you consistently have a shitty kicker? How do you not have the next Messi out there kicking
Not sure about CFB.  Can defense draw the offense into a false start?  That's defensive penalty in the pro game.
Fucking hell ESPN, turn off the game noise on the Coaches Film Room or turn up their microphones 
"Complimentary football"
Who you should cheer for based on where you bought your shirt:Wal-mart: AlabamaBookstore: GeorgiaAuburn: deathOnline: next year
They usually never need one. 
Coaches film room
Ouch owie oof my score
It must be the easiest thing ever to write those keys to the game.
Thats actually kinda my favorite ad atm. Kitty so angery. 
Online, Xbox and phone are all a disaster. 
P H Y S I C A L I T YHYSICALITY
It was Matthew Berry
Just found out Lil Sweet is Justin Guarini
https://youtube.com/watch?v=S5ZSDCvUwN8
The Andersons got tickets to the game? How did they get tickets to the game?
Thanks, Harvard!
They had Eddie but then he decommited/picked Florida 
RIP Sackenburg
Omg this is Ellie Nash from Degrassi. Still cute. 
Freezing every 10 seconds? 
I don't like you!
Well, glad the first 5 minutes of the game meant absolutely nothing
You'd think the top high school kickers would be dying to come to Bama 
What are you all drinking?  I going with Sierra Nevada Torpedo.
georgia is about to lose by 20 lol remember this comment after you downvote it
So since it is the national championship game are we getting a new Rob Riggle commercial, or what?
I think that's only for the NFL, but I think it applies to the defenders saying go 
There is nothing more useless than some awkward corporate executive trying to butt into a sports game to say hi and buy their products. 
Flair up
Word had it that it''s the big ten, don''t know if it''s true. Can someone confirm?
I have a Chubb right now from that slant
So somewhere in Argentina?
Big 10 or PAC 12. They said at the coin toss but I don''t remember. 
Weird how no one else was in that bar....
Jesus Fromm has an absolute cannon. 
Great defense,  meh offense,  special teams?  What is that?  Classic Alabama football.  
Lebatard''s radio show stream is funny as always. Going back and forth on that and the main stream.
prayers up for everyone on watchESPN tonight
largest sports provider in the U.S.......cant provide a competent stream cool
great play call
>How. How since at least 20 fucking 13 have we been incapable of recruiting a kicker? How is it possible that we can't find one fucking kid in the entire country who's got a leg and is willing to come play for Championships every other year, all while getting to smash any piece of ass at the school he wants?>How?
I was kinda thinking the same thing, kinda. I'm sorry, but B1G games are nothing like SEC games.
It''s just our FG unit. Punting and returning is pretty good
Slow down guy....
That stadium's roof kinda looks like a butthole.
This stadium is just a big robot anus
Lol watch Georgia do something stupid like score a TD on the 2nd play
This skycam view is pretty sick
BRB. Switching all my services to AT&T
Do Gawgs!
You're not the only one who missed the kick ;)
She showed me her boobies, and I like them too!
Hello friend. 
Ask Auburn, the slant destroys Bama 
COMING OUT FIRE
I have developed an irrational hatred for the word "physicality"
Why hasn't UGA ran the ball once 
I wanna see an 85 yard Nick Chubb run to seal the game 
bad throw is lucky i suppose... or play better...
Reddit Upvote Game: Upvote a random whenever there's a buzz word on broadcast1. SEC Speed2. Baker Mayfield / Heisman3. Jalen hurts as a runner4. Kendrick Lamar Halftime Show5. Sabans record vs people who worked under him.Gild for:1. UCF should be the National Chanp2. Nick Chubb Gives me a Chub
Is this game on OTA anywhere?
Yeah!
Riight. That was the kickers fault.
+1, all season long I've had maybe 1 or 2 hiccups total.
CAN ONLY THROW SLANTS
It can go suck my sweeeeet dr. Pepper can. Flawless commercials shitty game stream 
We are merely playing for second place.
you'd think after multiple years having great seasons with year after year terrible kickers some high school kid could say "hey, I'm good at kicking the football, I could go play for Bama and be a part of that system!"  nah.
I don't know about we, but for sure me
Is Lane Kiffin watching this game or playing beer pong at some sorority house?  
those jordan 4 cements?
Because offense actually has the power and responsibility to start the play, and therefore defense needs to be able to respond to movement. Meanwhile defense can''t start the play, so offense has no excuse to be starting without actually beginning the play. 
I always did like death 
What is that?
What channel is it on?
I recognize that actress, though. What was she in?
Alabama said they doesn't need Allstate's good hands to win. Only running touchdowns
this might be a hot take but Kirby Smart is a good coach
Who would win? The most fearsome team of the past decade or their own kicky boi?
That's actually a really good drawing
Thanks Harvard.
A QB hitting a receiver in stride. What is this?
I''m just waiting for a NCAA Football 19 teaser trailer
Yeah!
Looking at this thread on the updated version of the mobile app is quite something 
The announcers said 70/30 Georgia earlier 
he had just drilled one from 35 though
I'm one of the lucky people who can read without reading out loud. I also don't use Wells Fargo
Ze do Nothink!!!!
As long as he isn't in the neutral zone or touch am Alabama player it's legal.
PlayStation Vue to the rescue. Also fuck WatchESPN
Nick Fromm throws slants????
Death it is
We are a bunch of spoiled brats who expect perfection.
Shoot my stream doesn't have commercials so I can't shitpost about them. Uhhhh... Uhhhhh... *panics*"Hi I'm a Mac""...and I'm a PC"
>they makes it to the moon.>Apollo 13Does not compute
Glad I don''t care too much about this game. Because it''s basically unwatchable. 
exactly lmao
Watch ESPN app: Ads and Commercials load flawlessly in 720pAlso Watch ESPN app: Game paused ever 2-3 seconds to buffer. 360p max.
Gotta catch that buddy.
Sign up some of these dudes who wrecked my ass in pick-up soccer.
That made me laugh.
"They'll be expecting us to run, so we won't run all game"
Has Georgia run the ball? 
Fromm already looks like a more accurate passer than Blake Bortles.
About as successful as the kick.
I really don''t understand, can get any kicker in the country 
4? Try Saban's ENTIRE reign. Man can build defenses and win championships, but finding a kicker? Nah bro.
That stadium looks so nice. I'm totally going to visit it when I go to Atlanta in March
I'm glad I wasn't the only one thinking that..
They estimated 70/30 for Georgia in the pregame
So are the Dawgs gonna run, or...?
Can we skip to the fourth quarter That''s where all the excitement happens 
Nerves?
[removed]
The real reason to watch tonight
Yeah!
that's a terrible drop
Yes 
offense and defense helping each other. Not having one side stuck on the field too long.
Catch the ball Wims
You can watch any Alabama game from this season.  Similarly shitty kick as in EVERY FUCKING GAME.
ooof.  Can't drop those.  
I have Hulu and it's only 30fps :/
I said "All the letters on the back of his shirt were weighing him down" and a girl laughed. I'm gonna ride that wave all week.
Elle Nash from Degrassi is trying to get me to open an account at Wells Fargo.
Get Wims some stickum
had the back out in the flat
Big drop there 
I never knew Bama had a Josh Scobee on their team.
Saban is a dial-click to the right from stroking out at any moment, so my money is on Lil Sweet. 
Espnnews
AT&T pandering level at maximum
CATCH THAT BALL!!!!
Damn. Gotta make those gimme catches. 
Amazing 
You can't drop those passes -__-
Espn news has a sweet set up right now
Not yet 
Wims has the case of stone hands
Plz
I'm pretty sure same thing here. Faking a snap count for example is a delay of game on the defense
The logo makes it look like each down is 2nd and 18. 
Yeah!
Diet Dr. Pepper is the shit but that commercial is awful.
That attitude doesn''t fly in the southeast. College Football is all we have
Wims got the yips
Yes. Yes I would.
That hook and ladder would''ve went for a TD
nope
DAE think UCF would already be up 72-0 rn?? The logic is really quite simple 
What a weird reference
WatchESPN is utter poop and I can''t find a solid stream
That throw was *crisp*
Tfw you have gigabit internet and WatchESPN is still fucked 
Holy crap Fromm lasered that slant in there. Surprised we held on to it
Insta buy!
2-0
Jake Fromm State Farm?
Number 6 has the yips
Bout the only thing we agree on, I'd guess.
Hey, AT&T, you know how many times I've made a decision about a major monthly expense based on a commercial during a national championship game? Zero. Zero times.
That boy is scared
I''m gonna use halftime to go on a beer run. I kinda hate the fact that there''s a halftime show
How did Fromm not see switft there
Right there with you.    GO DAWGS
Megatron's pooper
This WatchESPN stream is making my brain hurt. 
yeah, playing against alabama tends to make your wr's struggle  source: am Clemson fan 
So what's the opposite of "Stickum" that Georgia apparently put on their gloves?
Yeah, making it sound like they're losing all these games because of the kicker. 
Nope
I would die
Pretending I'm colorblind and Georgia is the Packers is making it a lot easier to cheer for them
I'm loving this command center view
Unwatchable for me atm
Shooters shoot
Commentator said UGA 70 BAMA 30 earlier.
Found the deaf guy.
no
Once I think
Its just the kicker really. Bama has a great punter
ESPN app has perfect quality on commercials but as soon as the game comes back on it goes to absolute shit. 
YouTube tv working for me. 
Yeah!
After tonight, we don't have to listen to: DO YOU BELIEVE THAT YOU CAN WIN THIS FIGHT TONIGHT?!?!? 
Are we going to get 2 hours of a clown show for a game?
Fuck you tim Fromm has 2 other options... 
SEC always wins
commercials......................
Beautiful
why does Georgia keep throwing wtf
Reminds me of Fiorina saying she was rooting for Iowa in the Rose Bowl during the primary when she went to Stanford... 
Hey Georgia fans, is your Godwin related to the one on the Bucs?
holy shit throwback.  justin long is a dweeb
"alright Saban, I'll take your soul for the championships""deal.""wait wait wait... no special teams""... I'll take it"
Georgia has a tendency to not want to run the ball despite it working perfectly each time
The difference between a mike stoops defense and nick saban defense might be a little different 
I guess they are trying to establish to make Bama back off the line. 
Damn it. Stop dropping passes. 
negative
Finally something I can agree with Alabama fans on
How does nick Saban not have an half dozen of the best kickers in the southeast 
[deleted]
Got a decent stream? Mines pausing to buffer every 10 seconds :(
I swear it's gotten worse over the years too.
No
Has Alabama completed a pass?
Astroglide.
fuck att and this perpetually broken uverse shit
Flubber 
Man, Tim Tebow is shit when caught off guard on TV. My god lol. But he rescued himself later on.
Vaseline
I bet everyone there is enjoying some Chick-Fil-A because it''s a Monday!
The Chargers and injuries
Saban, at the beginning of each season: "All right everyone, I believe we've assembled the best possible team with the best possible players at each position."Assistants: "But what about a kic--"Saban: "I said we have everyone."
So if Alabama loses are they going to destroy their runner up trophy on the stage? 
Wims needs to settle down.
Jake Fromm is a shooter and you know what shooters do
I think there's too many coaches in the Coach's room.Too much talking over each other.
Georgia has had like 4 plays. 
Brickum
That's how I feel about every shootyhoops game ever
Georgia sure is throwing a whole lot for a team that has Sony Michel and Nick Chubb.
Georgia's had more dropped balls than a room of 12 year old boys. 
Boy heard footsteps
[deleted]
Pls
I'm not enjoying shit. Waiting on Bane to blow the bottom out of the field. 
drop it like its hot
Seems Georgia forgot them too
All these refs have skinny arms0/10 NCG 
go sit next to the soccer fields and pick one of the guys that are playing. I'm sure they know how to kick a ball better.
Baby oil
Yeah he''s pretty..., intelligent 
Is anyone else''s WatchESPN stream a pixel-y, buffer-y mess?
C'mon let's go.
Because the next Messi can make a killing at 18 playing soccer professionally overseas.
o rlly ?

WHERE IS MUSCLES REF WHEN WE NEED HIM

It's so bad
obligatory big if true
But like, the old 4 Loko, not this weird crap they have now...
Pop Secret extra butter movie theater popcorn 
I mean I kinda like seeing the Marines on the field because it''s fun to laugh at boots 
Better get Jerry Rice on the phone
Catch the fucking ball shit
Georgia coming out throwing, damn.
I wish Gary Patterson were on the coaches stream. He was a legend last week.
Gotta open up the run game and give the TRUE FRESHMAN some confidence if they're going to pull this one out. 
Georgia was part of the Soviet Union, right?Roll tide!
Don''t let anyone tell you UGA doesn''t like gator (arms)
Wims will make a 15+ yard catch later that no one has any business catching.
hahahaha that guy holding kirby smart's belt is hilarious
The announcer literally just explained why. 
Hey my wife has a question: she wants to see Kendrick Lamar during half time. Will ESPN show the performance or should she try to watch it elsewhere?
I just hope there's no injuries today. Injuries are the worst. 
I can't escape the curse of Scobee 
I walked away from the screen.Was the flag on the FG a false start, then he missed the next one?
Watch ESPN has been absolutely awful. It has to be the worst sports streaming app now
The winner gets ND State, right?
The main stream sucks. But try the hometown radio feed. Same broadcast, less people streaming it, plus hometown radio broadcasters instead of ESPN announcers!Other option I like is the sky cam or the sounds of the game stream. Sounds of the game is great cuz it''s the same video feed of the main stream, but all you hear is the crowd, the bands, and the PA announcer!
Thanks!
when the cfb stream sub fails you and you resort to the cfb thread comments to follow the gamethis sucks
This is really petty, but the espn "homer broadcast" isn't nearly partisan enough. Have more fun with it
Run the ball
*::insert amazing horn score::*
I like Georgia.
Fair enough, but my point stands. Twitter, especially sports and politics twitter, is absolute garbage. Always has been and always will be.
smellin a draw here
was bad last week too.  ESPN is poop
Get.. get Tim Tebow of my screen RIGHT NOW
Holy feedback, Batman
I think I'm in the minority, but I honestly miss Centuries.
I NEED BUFF DADDY REF
Seriously fuck WatchESPN

No you wouldn't its empty words sprayed in the air to get a reaction out of people, or you're a psychopath
Kirby Smart has such a flat head.
WatchESPN code was written by university of iowa students.
Vikings fans just cringed 
WatchESPN is also a buffer fest atm FYI.
Does Kirby have a guy whose whole job is to keep him on the sideline?
Hook and ladder was on, and he was going to score. 
Hate it. 
Could you have picked a more random comparison?
Garbage
Free week of Youtube TV, if available.
I hope that folks capable of reading have stopped using Wells Fargo by now.
Wims is scared!!!
So much flinching
The refs from last year>
Probably sucks to hear your number announced to 80k people
something something centuries
glad it's not just me.I actually had to replace my 1X today and hadn't activated the ESPN app on this xbox...which worked out real well when ESPNs fucking activation service was down for the first 10 minutes of the game
ATTABOY
SHUT EM DOWN
Thread already has 7k comments and we are 5 minutes into the game. Here come 8 game threads"First half of the first quarter game thread"
"The Presidents got tickets to the game?? How'd THEY get tickets??"
I wish I got paid a ridiculous amount to hold Kirby Smart''s pants on the sideline
BRING THE PAYNE
They read that from a mile away.

Am I the only one who thinks it's an absolute travesty that Taylor Swift has never played a Superbowl halftime show?
$$$
16/21 on the season - could be worse.  plus they're not normally playing games that come down to fg's.
They need the chubby ones that think they're buff so they wear overly tight shirts.

It's okay, I don't like me either.
Why the fuck can I only watch the game on ESPN2 with these dumbass announcers always on the screen? I have Spectrum
Currently looking like last season 
It''s like Kirby is forgetting that he has the best RB tandem in the country 
Wow Bama really fucked with the O-line there. That was fucked
Bama's defense is so damn fast
"Throwing on their terms"Daron Payne proceeds to deliver conditions

Our running game is good.  Teams expect it, but struggle to stop it.  We''ve developed our culture around running the ball. Because of this, we are going to fuck around and pass it.
When did the "guy who literally holds the head coach back" trend start 
These live comments going so fast...let me add this one to make it go faster
Wims if they have your family blink twice
Damn that looked nearly catchable
A silver lining to this debauchery.... 
Xbox One App stream is okay, sometimes loses quality and it's at least 30 seconds behind live
Yes
walk on water
Correct.
What's the point of playing if UCF already claimed the National Championship
I''m sorry commentators, but Georgia''s biggest concern is being Georgia.
You can do that?
Same. Actually a pretty good deal I might be looking at changing my Comcast account and keeping sling. 
no
Lol @ Kirby's belt bitch
I need this quarter to end 6 to 6. It's worth 250 samolians
It's wild, ain't it?  "The Process."
I could never
It''s a penalty to imitate the snap count. You can absolutely attempt to draw a false start, as long as you''re not crossing into the neutral zone 
ya got a bit too cluttered, I went back to command center
come on dawgs
We had one go from abysmal to alright once... Leigh tiffin. He was terrible freshman and sophomore year but saved Alabamas ass a few times his senior year. 
N
Rumor has it Saban wears Cutoff khaki shorts under his game pants 
does payne project as a high first round pick?
Not part of his masterful pact with the devil apparently.
ESPN Buffering Cast 2018!
Oklahoma would've put up 7 by now lol
butter
Ah the old Tim Beck strategy
Coaches room is complete ass. Need some one spicy like Ogeron or Patterson
huh?
How? Doesn''t it start in like, 5 hours?
Slickum
It's the app, not your internet. 
I think our big 12 defense has forever scarred the georgia offense, they will never take their opponents defense seriously!
Yes he does!
Alabama expects a run. Kirby has Georgia throw the ball all game. 4th quarter Michel breaks out at 99 yard run for the winning td. 4-D chess.
Centuries was awful too. I was trying to remember which song it was. 
Bama, if y''all could just not recruit a good front 7 for the next few years I''d appreciate it
UGA should try running, since it, you know, kinda got them here
oh don't pretend we don't know how it feels for the last 10 years...
lube
Its better than 100K. 
7 plays and 7 passses with that backfield...
"not available in your area." :(
wasn't random, bortles played awful in a big game just yesterday with short passes.
Tide D is no fucking joke
What really happened to TWA Flight 800
I''m watching this in ESPN.com. Does the Tv broadcast also have this SEC player commentary? 
What a catch 
I want that job
Classic Air Raid Georgia
Fake the punt 
Our kicker the 4 years prior was the number 1 rated out of high-school but sucked with the pressure
Talking heads said 70/30 UGA
We should try that one thing where we give our rbs the ball
We have an amazing run game, let's just throw it all night. 
I was being sarcastic. I don't feel bad for you at all. I hope he starts recruiting one legged kickers to fuck with the fans. 
Damn that tip
Nice catch there by the coach 
OH FROMMY, GIVE ME YOUR HIGH THROWS
DA''RON PAYNE PLS
Just here to see who wins the losers bracket.UCF is already the one true champ
And SpectrumAnd ComcastI'm starting to think it's a ESPN problem. 
Yes. Also if they win as well.
Mine was doing the same thing.This is better. [Here](http://www.emburl.ml/embed/video.php?v=bS9DS0tMSllaQkZqQlZPeGovM0VDbmVyaGIxenlvaVhtMER2T1J3QlpkeFJQVmpFR3J1dkN0WWlhVkp6ZVBwdg==)
ESPN skycam is awesome 
Yuppers
he launched that ball...
What about regular espn?
Setting up that presidential campaign 
I've never even heard of it. 
damn, Bama's secondary is brutal
Did Nick Chubb miss the plane or something?
Stream it on watch espn
Not this debate again
yo get that georgia asst a scholarship
Personally, I'd be after some of that Deliah's if I was there
Fromm is making some dangerous ass throws right now.
Just think, I'm the BCS era we would be watching Clemson vs. Oklahoma right now. While I personally would like that, thank god we have the playoff
Great defense. Man that DC must be something else
Bills Jags Part II 
Try running?
Alabama DBs are playing their asses off
Ikr.

Safeties are lit tonight
Flashbacks to the Miracle at Jerdin-Hair.
The new lights in this dome make it look weird.
And given up 7?
Georgia should try running the ball
Now the another fun part of our team-punt returns.
The main stream sucks. But try the hometown radio feed. Same broadcast, less people streaming it, plus hometown radio broadcasters instead of ESPN announcers!Other option I like is the sky cam or the sounds of the game stream. Sounds of the game is great cuz it''s the same video feed of the main stream, but all you hear is the crowd, the bands, and the PA announcer!
Lots of coaches do
It's that SEC SPEED
Was that assistant job to hold the Georgia  coach from going on the field in a fit of rage against the refs?
Great safety play from Thompson.  Came flying out of nowhere.
Good call, do they keep the stats and the other 2 video angles at the bottom the whole time?
Bamas secondary closes in so fast on the ball 
Can we stop throwing to Wims for Christ sake 
Might be time to start running the ball dawgs
To me, this game is better than the superbowl.
wyd fromm
I was told there would be a run game.
Athletic af
It's a secret ploy to fuck up YouTubeTV's free trial churn numbers.
This is going to be one of this 9-6 bullshit games, isn''t it?
Break tendencies!
That's some balling from Thompson, damn.
I want Payne to get another TD.  SO bad.
If they run they''ll be TFL
unrelated but how does one become a Golden Domer and SC fan?
I guess we aren't gonna run today
I love the ball flip fromm  does on his drop back kids got focus
If there isn't a more likable player than Payne...
What's that thing when you give the ball to the guy behind you rather than throwing it?  Smart wants to know
So like, how bout a run
I find it ironic that the National Championship is sponsored by AT&T 
What did you want them to do? Run it on 3rd and 15? A couple of those passes were screens, essentially runs. 
Is Andy Reid calling the plays for Georgia?
I like this Kirby Smart bald handler.
but... hes the sweet one
If your stream sucks check r/cfbstreams! Hasn''t frozen once since I switched over to a link on that subreddit!
interesting. it just makes me sad to see your comment so upvoted. It seems like a real shift going on with the attitude towards military these days. I for one am happy those that got to attend and present the colors on field were given the opportunity, while the ones deployed could be shown on screen. i think its great the crowd applauded them because i did too. Shows them they arent forgotten. I'd be curious to see how many of those upvotes were from people that have no affiliation with the service what so ever. Edit: downvotes for disagreeing with something. did i say anything disrespectful? no i didnt. 
SEC defense cancels out SEC offense. Going into OT 0-0 
UGA has as many first downs as they have turnovers
Lots of defence so far......nothing makes me harder then sexy D-back play and amazing tracer play from overwatch
If Fromm is going to be the starter for 2 mor eyears, does that mean Justin Fields won't get to play till he's a jr?
Nah man. That''s the pure unadulterated defense. The defense is so strong even open guys are covered. -Finebaum
The Dan LeBatard stream on ESPN3 is mesmerizingly absurd...
Payne remains the best. 
Nice flop
Patterson was epic last week. Learned so much just from watching that broadcast.
Main broadcast is on ESPN. 
Lol to your lol
I know everybody knows this but Alabama''s D is no joke.. where''d that safety come from? 
if this was the nfl that would have been a screen pass
phew
I'm upset that I will never be a part of a Taco Bell sponsored student section
7 straight passes 0 runs to open the game? Are they even gonna try?
He''s a nevernude
Can we run now please? I think we know that passing doesn't work right now
I feel like putting your arms around the receiver is not allowed
Imagine being the guy whose only job is to hold Kirby Smart's pants all game and prevent him from running too far out off the sideline. Lol
Nothing there really
[deleted]
Poise
On one hand I like Georgia but on the other hand if Saban wins another he might fuck off sooner. What to do?
Please, no more Payne. 
Suprised uga not trying to run so far 
Does UGA have RBs?
The short passes were working for uga
Why in the hell isnt Georgia running the ball?!??
The UCF comparisons don't stop!
Go Thunder? 
This games gonna end 3-2 
Oh baby what a punt
God damn it, why did I bet the over
Bama defense doing amazing again
Nice punt
Fromm can throw a ball like 10 times longer than Hurts
Sling Tv my dude. 15 minutes delayed but flawless
360d Parcheesi
Is it not?
missed this whole drive on watch espn from buffering
That deep ball is going to be the death of Fromm.
I agree, but its been 100% solid all game on that link.  I dont think its the same feed as watchespn (or something?)
I'm thinking this Bama team may be kinda good
And given up 14
Fair catches shoould be outlawed.
That's a questionable punt protection formation.
Wtf is Georgia doing? Have they passed the ball every play?
Clemson vs Georgia*. For those of you upset with my statement, you can go look it up yourself. 
Because Spectrum sucks. ESPN is showing this game on ESPN, ESPN 2, ESPN News, and ESPN Deportes all with different video feeds.
Except for the players. They probably had a meal devised by a dietician.
Oh fantastic I always wanted to watch a replay of Bama-LSU ncg
Once...
Yep. Total garbage. 
Uhh was Georgia missing someone on the o line for the punt
He's thinking we need to wear them down first with the passing game then run up the middle.
Georgia isn't going to win through the air. Not sure what Kirby is thinking 
Fuck off, Honda. 
How those huge motherfuckers are that much faster than me blows my mind 
Fromm capitalizes off of playaction and passing it when a run is expected.  He isn''t going to beat a good defense with his arm.
First time using WatchESPN? 
Too bad they won''t have him next year. 
Remember, we can send HD signals from the surface of Mars but can't get the picture clear and in HD from a game in Atlanta.
This commercial fucking creeps me out 
I enjoy watching Alabama lose. They are my least favorite College Football team. When the team they play against scores, I think to myself "yes".When Alabama scores, I think to myself "no".
I thought the game was in atl
Worked all year.  I wouldn't abandon it so quickly.
Not even a warm loving embrace?
Take your upvote sir
Ah it's gonna be that kinda game against UGA from the refs?
Too bad Georgia doesn't have a running game. 
Is UGA's coaching staff so scared of the Bama front 7 they aren't even going to try to fucking run the ball? Come the fuck on 
Lololol
Georgia going back to their Oklahoma strategy of lulling them into a false sense of security by getting nothing done passing lol
Thoughts on this broadcasting format? 
This year
Then they should have beat GA... stop with this shit
The main stream sucks. But try the hometown radio feed. Same broadcast, less people streaming it, plus hometown radio broadcasters instead of ESPN announcers!Other option I like is the sky cam or the sounds of the game stream. Sounds of the game is great cuz it''s the same video feed of the main stream, but all you hear is the crowd, the bands, and the PA announcer!
Getback coaches.
Let''s settle our freshman quarterback by throwing it every play.
The Georgia offense can''t afford to make many more mistakes, this Alabama D is no joke.
[deleted]
Too predictable, can't attempt
It's called strategy bro. I guess you would run on 3rd and 15?
I'm turning this off. If I wanted yo see tiny arms, I'd watch the Crossfit Games
You're watching a different stream. You can get the normal stream with kirk and chris fowler if you go to a different stream.
Yes
Georgia refuses to run da bawl
Why in the fuck isn't uga running??? 
What's up with Georgia teams not wanting to run the ball in championship games?
Yup! same here
I feel inferior because of your flairs.
There are 4 broadcasts.  Normal one, coaches and two "local" ones. 
C
Yep. The "get back coach."
All other things being equal, if Alabama had Baker Mayfield or Lamar Jackson, they would never lose a game.
Rooting for Georgia tonight
Just a layman but it seems Alabama's defense seems slightly better than Oklahoma's. 
ZERO RUSH YARDS? WHAT THE FUCK GEORGIA
At least Georgia coaches are catching these passes?
Yes and they are terrifying
Deep throws to setup the run game?
When they weren''t dropped...
One channel did on the TV. I swapped to ESPN 1 to get just the game. 
You don't say
Well alright then... Howay the Lads!
K
Fuck you, Honda, let me be mediocre.
Can we run the ball please?
Which broadcast are you on? There are multiple.
2 drives 0 carries from Chubb/Michel. Are they saving them for the 2nd half?
Ummm Kirby you have two decent running backs
You going to score some points or whistle Dixie
Tua in please, stop messing around
Thompson looking like an ATHLETE.
They know they have to spread each others defense a bit. Power running immediately will get stuffed
They got a first down?
Spread the defense. Makes running easier. This won''t last beyond the next drive or two. 
I cant watch anything except for Skycam and I''m on an Apple TV
Log in from a PC and use incognito. It's an issue with their app they're working on. Took me like ten tries. 
My stream was like 2 minutes behind so i couldnt keep up with these comments so i had to get my ass out of my bedroom and into my living room and it ruined my whole life i blame michigan go dawgs
Yes I would rather see team photos than a replay of the punt. Thanks!
Yup, 7 straight passes 0 runs.
How about the fucking Starship Enterprise? Thats good because it was for science right? But yet it had weapons so, your brain must short circuit on that one?
ALABAMA'S HELMETS LOOK LIKE RASPBERRY TOOTSIE POPS
Sigh....I just know this is going to be a boring game that ends 14-10 or something like that. 
Zero runs. Not a fan of that. Get back to the run game. 
That's the S&C coach.  So not his only job.
Saban confusion. Think he prepared for the run so don''t give him the run! 
Eh, despite originally being from Indiana, I'm not really a hoops fan. 
Yes, but against the number 1 rush defense, you usually have to pass to open the run
Yeah but Bama would have 30 so...
Anyone saying that fromm has handled the rest of the season well, you''re right. But the NCG is just different 
The main stream sucks. But try the hometown radio feed. Same broadcast, less people streaming it, plus hometown radio broadcasters instead of ESPN announcers!Other option I like is the sky cam or the sounds of the game stream. Sounds of the game is great cuz it''s the same video feed of the main stream, but all you hear is the crowd, the bands, and the PA announcer!
Saban is going to retire when he starts to feel that he's losing it. Until then, he's here to stay. 
Check it out.  It''s like a cross between the matrix and a mystery noir
What a deal for the Georgia punter. Ivy league degree and gets to play in a national championship
agh, we just to get some rhythm going
That's our S&C coach's secondary job, Coach wrangler
And still tries to talk to girls your age.
The real MVP right here
I actually like the playcalls here, start pass heavy to open up the run instead of having the latter stuffed right off the bat. Still plenty of time left in the game, at least there is some sort of strategy for loosening up the Bama run D
He''s our strength and conditioning coordinator, so not exactly his *only* job.Still hilarious tho.
Dey skeerd pawl
No
I know but he''s not himself tonight and that''s making me nervous. 
Why have even have Chubb, and Michel. Fuck me! 
My first thought when i saw the commercial as well... Timmy has a real problem on his hands.
RS SO
Best WR in the nation
This is gold. GOLD I tell ya
It''s a logistical nightmare as well. All the available security and local PD have to work extra hard.
It's on espn news 
I reallllllllly hate these Honda commercials 
Can our offense actually make some points now?
That ball was in the air a long time
Alabama's only white person is the kicker and he has been the worst player on the field so far.
They''re like an hour away from Athens, idk if a plane would even ascend fully
If yall don't run today, you're gonna have a bad time. 
I''ve never understood why they mispronounce Jordan 
slingtv and watchespn are both complete trash. How is a free streaming page so far and beyond better than a corporation like sling and espn? Cancelling my Sling subscription immediately - the only reason I ever got it was for live sports, which they're clearly incapable of streaming. /rant, also - fuck Bama
Line too. Who needs LB''s?
the problem with these Big 12 matchups is that teams want to pass on every down even when they have decent RBs. Wait these teams are from where?
Holy shit,  use your RBs
crazy he's a true freshman. bet he'll be scary next year O.o 
LMAO
I think this telecasted video thing might just catch on
This trophy commercial is fucking terrible 
Did Kirby forget who his RB's are?
Georgia forgot you can run?
What!? You put your guys right next to the punter so you can be pushed into your own punter. Right?
Neither team is capable of winning this game without establishing the run, idk what SEC offenses are doing half the time.
Lets go Bama..... Please
Georgia hasn't ran the ball yet? They're trying to outsmart themselves 
Forreal. I like the fact that Fromm isn''t sucking but come on, Kirby. Get the ball to Michel and Chubb. 
Even if the safety wasn't there, pass was underthrown and CB was right there.
Alabama is pushing the linebackers close to the line right now so he is trying to open the defense up
I'd hate both teams in that game too
I've eaten so many chicken wings this weekend 
...and that is our weakness on defense.
The linebackers are too solid to try and gut em every play. Gotta try and back them up a bit I guess 
Catch em off guard and slam it in with the run game? I really don''t know to be honest. 
We''re here to entertain people. Not kill players.
Saban leaves the fridge empty. Trust me. I know. 
LOL the clown show begins
So defense looking good which means offense will probably start shitting soon and help UGA.
Don't forget '11 first game against LSU. Something like 3-4 missed kicks combined from a couple different kickers.
Let's all just be thankful clemson isn't in this game. 
I''d do it for free. 
I mean its open. Wims dropped a crucial ball that would have led to our first run lol
I think 4 would be a good number for different opinions but still paying attention to each other. With 6 it feels like sometimes you get each side of the table having their own conversation.
Who is 94 on the Alabama DLine? Getting a ton of love on the coaches film room.
Fuck me sideways. Give me a stop boys. Or just made them kick from 40 out.
Only slightly
You can't play the same trick twice in a row
I''ll donate any karma 2 shutdown fullcast. I''m not that original
STOP....MAKING.....FROMM....THROW IT!!!
Something must be in that stadium that makes coaches pass happy 
The main stream sucks. But try the hometown radio feed. Same broadcast, less people streaming it, plus hometown radio broadcasters instead of ESPN announcers!Other option I like is the sky cam or the sounds of the game stream. Sounds of the game is great cuz it''s the same video feed of the main stream, but all you hear is the crowd, the bands, and the PA announcer!
Yeah Saban will never see that coming
We could send the same memo to Daboll
Do we get the three?
Refs let the secondary make more contact in big games
Now I know how to spell Honda 
Please do. I beg them. Should be hilarious. 
The get back coach is important!
Why isn't Georgia running the ball Bama's defense is all over this Georgia offense so far...
Love the idea, hate its used on a Honda Accord
Real talk: so many people bitch about the playoff, but here's the thing: It's the best system we have ever had. Yes, it has room to get better, but you don't want to constantly tweak it like the BCS and ruin it. I like it the way it is. 
UCF would've beat both of these teams
got'em
Idk why people are all that surprised UGA hasn't ran. Bama is stacking those boxes hard
You see, they are using underthrows and dropped passes to setup the run. 
That might be ESPN 2 homer broadcast my dude :3
Sick catch by the coach though.
Two NFL running backs. He''s trying to be too slick right now and it''s not working. 
“Georgia''s offense appears to be a series of poor decisions” yeah that about sums it up
I''m fine with this
hi all I'm new here.  Can't I watch the game live via reddit somehow?  Help!
0-0 tie?
I'm asking myself that too. They probably want to test the waters but I wanna see those running backs do some work. 
K
Holy shit the live comments on the mobile app is driving me nuts. 
Has Georgia even run the ball?
K
Yo aussie checking in. Been watching for a few years. What's up with the HCs being held back by the belt by massive fucking blokes on the sideline?
I don''t like what I''ve seen from either team offensively. Georgia has gone full Air Raid, and Hurts is well... 
Watch ESPN sucks. Can''t play for more than 5 seconds without lagging. 
This game has the hallmarks of a 10-7 shootout already.
ESPNU? 
Yet they go for the same situation that resulted in a pick. Must be saving the running game for after the half.
not inaccurate
All I get is a blank screen on regular ESPN. 
Is Chubb on like a "pitch" count or something?
Da''ron Payne projected 1st round pick
His job is to keep Kirby from getting a penalty for being on the field when he shouldn't. Hardest working guy on the team.  
I thought it was Mike Leach tbh
No, but after her last album I'm glad
1 run -1 yard, yikes
cant believe oklahoma choked so i have to watch this garbage game where georgia loses by 20
What sort of drugs do you have to take so the talking trophy commercial makes sense?
I see what you did there.
"Decent"
“Let''s throw it every play” -	Kirby Smart 
That's a neat trick! 
Alabama is selling out for the run right now. They're doing exactly what they should be. It just doesn't help when one of our guards let someone run right through the line and we had a false start.
Trying to catch Bama off guard. It''s not working.
number 1 rush D... pass to open the run... 
0 run plays, even more wtf
Most rushing yards of any duo of any running backs ever? Call 9 passes. What is you doing fam?
Daron Payne
Why? It protects returners. 
Live thread was a bad choice, really hard to keep up with comments.It''s basically a twitch feed at this point
Defense is doin what they're supposed to. Jalen, please stop worrying about if your stove is on and stop OVERTHROWING IT
5 called pass plays, 2 RPOs that Fromm read pass on. Let's get some called runs
No clue where it'll end up, but it'll be ten times father than a Hurts throw.
Prediction: regulation of this game ends with a score of 21-21.  Nick Saban and Kirby Smart meet midfield, clasp hands, and merge into one coaching superbeing.  The best of Georgia and Alabama's players take the field.  The group loses to UCF in the ensuing overtime.
Please run the ball
Save them for next season... in the NFL pls
Payne. He had a pick and td catch in the sugar bowl 
Flair up my dude
RUN THE DANG BAWL CHANEY
I'm jealous.
You can add a delay to the comments.
Oh shit you''re right. Maybe it''s that 2012(?) SEC champ re-run. 
DARK WEB TACO BELL
does everyone remember when UGA had two really good RBs? wait...
That Bama defense is looking superb right now 
Taco  bell what
I like my truck, Auburn sucks
Had a lot of good looks to. With a clean pocket that INT could been 6.
Winning championships?
Now for my weekly tradition of complaining about Chaney. 
Thread is going way too fast to keep up or to justify posting tonight for me.  Happy NCG, everyone! 
Are they both trying to lose because the winner gets invited to the white house?
He ain''t lyin''.
I'm wondering the same thing, but they're probably waiting to unleash later in the game as the defense gets tired.  idk.
I genuinely agree
dont know that for sure
Gotta be one hell of a handler for that job. He's literally my favorite staff member. 
Apparently
Belluminati
They're going to have to do one for each quarter, at least.
I think they're trying to spread Alabama's defense out. 
Welcome back Mayhem, we missed you!
I don't care how nice the new master bathroom is, you can't compete with that kitchen and the two car garage!
Which was worse, this year or the year of Fall Out Boy "Centuries?"
Bleach. 
What is the point of the boxing trophies having their guards up if they hit each other in the face literally every punch? they seem like shitty boxers
Your Prez is a genius
Cmon, no new commercials for the NCG??
It's awesome to have a choice of what you want to watch, but ESPN's streaming app being awful just ruins it entirely. I'm already back to watching it on cable
Espn stream worse than usual. Cannot go 15 seconds without buffering. Except for commercials.
What's everyone drinking tonight? 
Can't unsee
WHAT IS HAPPENING FROMM DOESN'T PASS DOWN THE FIELD WELL STOP IT. 
No, they were trying to get it out of Georgia territory and back to Bama land. 
Even if he was, it's not like the alternate back is garbage or something. 
Ha, holy shit. Me too! Lady at work got me a 12pack for the holidays.
The world wide leader in sports should take some of that money and put it into streaming
Belluminati is so stupid.
4D chess
UCF has beaten both of these teams
Not a Dickson level punt but still good.
I can't believe mayhem is back already 
Anyone have the gif of the reporter after the Tony Brown interview?
Haha that''s what they are EXPECTING!!Your run game is awesome, outsmart then by throwing the ball every play!!
Far from true you bigoted fuck
Eh..at least your teams win football games...
Lots of pushing and shoving, but we also got here early. It took 90 minutes to get in. I imagine it got bitter when folks were getting close to missing kickoff. 
Can someone paying more attention to the game than me answer if Alabama's defense has been zeroing in on the run and that's why Georgia isn't running?
It still reeks of Falcon
I take it that this is the new copypasta?
[Did anyone else notice Saban's fly was down??](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_B5E5HPIKKBY/TCgENnaXouI/AAAAAAAAAZs/JHip18_p03M/s320/Screen%20shot%202010-06-27%20at%2010.08.28%20PM.png)
I think theyre trying to open up the threat of the pass game.
Haha great message aaaaand it leads to an Accord
That punter of theirs is their MVP
LOL eh
MAYHEM IS BACK
LOL Orgeron just promoted Ensminger to OC. I'm going to chop my fucking dick off.
why?
Holy fuck, how has the team running the watchespn app not been fired. It has been dogshit for a while, but tonight is unwatchable. Had to switch to directnow for a consistent picture.
God damn. The WatchEpsn app combined with att internet is a perfect recipe for a shitty experience. Fuck me, these are the dog days of streaming
 #AlabamaIsMayhem
I mean, I'm Jacob
DaRon Payne. Beast
Except for one game toward the end of the season
Dilly Dilly!
I might have to. Is it on any streaming service or am I going to have to find a less savory source?
I get that you want to break tendencies, but being one dimensional will get you behind in a hurry. 
Defense and Big 12 don't mix.
Damn right!
Oh yes, because having a top 5 rusher of all time means they don't have a running game....
Belluminati confirmed
Draft Station, it's near my hotel.
Need a search party for Georgia''s RBs
Imagine Georgia with Matt Canada 
Switched over to Radio Call in ESPN and steam is smooth. If it slows down, I'll know it was you guys.
To make sure they don''t get a sideline warning/interference. I''d personally rather see them use actual leashes though.
:(
None?
YEA MAYHEM IS BACK!
I actually like it. I'm using the new app for the first time now, usually I stick to Alien Blue
Probably being extra careful to not get penalized for being on the field too much/far 
If the game ends regulation in a tie, does that mean UCF is the undisputed national champion?
booooo this man boooooo
:)
UGA clearly not confident in their ability to create room against that front. 
Yep. We haven't been terribly successful at it is the problem 
Allstate, that commercial was actually really funny
Yeah sure
Lol no
Unfortunately not!
As an OU fan, don''t know if I''d want any of that Bama defense. 
Bleach
It's deserved. He's beating the guard or center every play.
That's a lie and you know it
WatchESPN:Stutters during gamePerfect during commercials 
[removed]
Baby no
fu buddy... wife made me go on a diet :(
Anything better on /r/cfbstreams?
I hate being a reactionary fan, but damn I can't wait for Tua. Love me some Hurts but he's a rollercoaster.
I don't know how much more of this garbage ESPN stream I can take...anyone have any alternatives?
[deleted]
FEED NICK CHUBB
Early drops hurt. The Dawgs know that just because they''re in be Benz, they''re not the Falcons right?
Me too. The passes are there, we just gotta catch them. 
They get penalized if the go on to the field, it's insurance.
Hey, Georgia, how about you do what's been working this year and run the fucking ball?
[deleted]
Well should've been twice but a bad drop.
let's D, hold up here
14 outta nowhere on that bat
For those interested, Katie Nolan is hosting the cool room game view
I hope 
Geek night actually
MAYHEM IS BACK, WOOOOOO!

Punter too
Mayhem is more back than Texas
I wonder what would have happened if they didn''t make that bull crap late hit call during the ND vs Georgia game to give Georgia the win. Like would we have been able to keep our season together and would we be in this position? It''s amazing what 1 moment does to a season. 
That's one hot take there mister
Do people not know how to spell Honda?
So the best running back tandem in the country just isn''t going to get a chance?
chocolate milk
Not right away
Wanting us to lose I get. But your least favorite team? Come now. 
a good punt return is one where we don't fumble the ball. 
That Honda commercial should replace the dumbass sec 'means more' commercial
Also is it an issue that we are at 7500 comments with 9 mins left to go?
Da''ron Payne. He had an interception on the line last week. Plus he caught a touchdown in out heavy o package in the Sugar Bowl. 
I bet we could have also! Did you hear that we almost beat the national champs?
Run with Chubb you big dumb idiots.
Well I'm going to miss the week of no mayhem, how about ya'll?
cfb streams is imploding
NFL ball boys make over 50k a year. Gotta get your foot in the door somehow. 
Rouge
They could miss an entire quarter without establishing a positive run game against one of the most unforgiving defenses in college football.  This is not a good game.
You just reminded me we have tootsie pops. Thanks for that I'm gonna go get some. 
Auburn should have beat them when they had the chance....oh wait...
What? This ain''t the Super Bowl.
Dry where we are thankfully!
MAYHEM IS BACK ON THE MENU BOIS
I would do it for the national average salary. Easy. 
I can get behind this 
Makers Mark 
Let's keep it that way
I hope he can succeed. It'll take some time.
most of us dislike the SEC more than Clemson 
Okay. I'm just gonna rocket my BAC up a few levels quickly 
Of course mayhem couldn't keep his New Years resolution.
YouTubeTV or SlingTV are much better.
what makes you think a Saban win will make him go away sooner?
¿Porque no los dos?
I wonder how big the celebration will be in Georgia wins the national championship while in Atlanta?
I know 5 yards would mean nothing there: But I thought if the punter got touched by defense and the ball wasn't tipped it is a foul regardless how "close" they where. (Also didn't get a replay to see if a blocker got pushed into punter)
No one in Tuscaloosa is fucking anyone in an accord SORRY HONDA
Barefoot Moscato Wine and Jose Quervo Gold straight
I can't upvote more than once .....
What a heel turn by Mayhem
~~Big 12~~ Texas Tech.
He brings the Payne
Mayhem is back!!!!
If thats what it takes to enable the UCF NC memery...
Watching the coaches room broadcast is exactly what I imagine coaches film meeting sounding like. And I love it.
Time to run the toss sweep already. 
SEC SEC SEC SEC
Da'Ron Payne. Easily the best player on our line
whiskey and beer
Disagree with one of your points. Agree with others. Why do you promote your streaming services yet obviously neglect to have quality service?
Put Tua in
Jack and coke
Caprisun
Now, if our RB can hit wide open receivers
Though I hate commercials, I do like the mayhem ones. 
Kirby smart earlier today; "Fuck running, I'm just gonna pass it..."
PRO TIP: The “Hometown” WatchESPN broadcasts never buffer or randomly switch to 480p unlike the main one
vipbox
The alternative is “run into a brick wall 3 times every play.” We''re never gonna get the run game going if we can''t prove we can throw it.
After this game I''m playing NCAA 14 and having Michigan win their millionth national championship 
Yeah it has sucked for a long while...used to be so good and was my go to option but now I never use it, so crap.  
Mayhem's back, baby!
I just want one good commercial... just give me one!!!
Chaney*
Well if they don''t settle down, Alabama will beat them. Georgia can win this. 
MAYHEM
Did they fix the leak in the roof?
Absolutely. I was hanging out with my girlfriend in her dorm, at UGA. It was hilarious to hear the girl screams coming from all the neighbor dorms 
Bama does have the best run defense in the country... but yeah, they should mix it up a bit. 
Run the damn ball Bobo
Yeah, it's soooo much worse this year than last too. It makes no sense
Is Cornell Red?
Yep. I want that.
Da'Ron Payne, junior from the Birmingham area. Been a stud all 3 years at bama
They get penalized if they go too far out. New rule this year so they have someone watch them
I get that Alabama is good against the run, but we have to at least try
Word
...
Mayhem is back!
I haven't been to Taco Bell in years. Anything new they got there that's worth a shot?
The just showed a Nissan commercial in 4:3 to advertise Star Wars coming out December 15.What?
Bleach if these streams keep lagging.
Daron Payne
turnovers are more fun than touchdowns
Good job scheming the receivers open, just a lot of pressure from Bama leading to poor passes. Let''s get it together boys 
This game is ending in a 6-3 Bama win isn't it?
"start" the red zone is calling.
Daboll looks like Louis C. K. 
Why are you people complaining about Georgia not running it? Do you not understand strategy? Game plan? Two passes were screens and another play was 3rd and 15. 
To be fair, better throw (or better arm that can throw further) and we had a TD on that int. And we have a drop that would've been a 10yard gain there.Ain't like the throws aren't there
Fucking knew that the Mayhem ads would end like that
Maybe if he loses to a former assistant, the curse will be broken and he can finally rest? 
How do they price that as a $1 and still make money??
Hahah 1) read this in an Australian accent and got a good chuckle. 2) to answer, it's because when coaches run too far into the field the team can be penalized, the big blokes are there to prevent an excited (or pissed) coach from drawing a penalty on his team.
*Turns off tv*
Man, that red team is really impressive.
I miss when Watch ESPN would let you watch 4 things at the same time
Try the hometown stream? I had better luck with that last week.
Great snag, didn't break stride
If he ever gets a chance before transferring... ugh. Next year might be a change up though
How do I know college football is completely legit with no fixes? No one outside of Alabama and Georgia want to watch this game. No one.
^ that looks like a trap
There's multiple broadcasts with different announcers
Dawgs come on
its like when you practice basketball for hours a day to challenge your dad, then when the day comes you forget everything you have practiced and your dad gives you the what for. 
YouTube tv works pretty well 
Kirby trying to wear them down with the pass.
Daron Payne. He's a beast.
NCAA 14 was the shitttt
Some guys really can have it all.
If you try and run against Alabama your gonna have a bad time.
I''m thinking of using one of those next year, this year ive been using random streams
Hope we throw the ball some more. Chubb and Michelle need their rest 
Fuck ya, mayhem is back!
There's that Gatorade ad bench shot
DENNNNNNIS. Luckily seeing him makes me feel okay for watching this game with some night cheese. 
Fromm has pitches left from his appearance in th Little League World Series and he can''t take them home.

Why'd you have to bring up the Notre Dame game you asshole
Scotch and cider
*goood goood. Run the ball...*
Georgia would drink Gatorade. 
Once again PapaNasty takes a swing and a miss....
I am happy to assist with shit posting
When you watch commercials, the terrorists win.
Is Georgia waiting to unleash Chubb when Bama defense gets tired?
I forgot I got a $25 taco bell gift card for christmas
HHAS GEORGIA NOT RUN THE BALL ONCE YET?!
Commercials are pre-loaded
It's the massive blokes job to keep them from getting to far onto the field, where they would get a penalty.
God dammit
I can. No. Georgia has an awesome running game so they are trying to outsmart Alabama by passing the ball every play. 
I forgot about him, he has a mean leg and can pin it deep. Also, I know you're joking, but try watching a Utah game... The kicker and punter are the actual best players.
The Bachelor has some [hotties this season](http://abc.go.com/shows/the-bachelor/news/updates/the-bachelor-2018-season-22-women-announced).
Streaming ESPN 2 seems to work better 
It was commissioned as part of a Nigerian relief package
its such garbage... I'm having to watch the coaches room because its the only stable stream I found
Yes. They've been stacking the box a ton. Really selling out against the run.
Spoilers Bro!
There is a good picture going around where the Kirby hold back guy has his own hold back guy.
Haha the teams are moving the ball too well for that. 
Mayhem is back!
I swear if Alabama wins another ship I will drink a beer 
Can you imagine a team winning the title with 1 completed pass?  Crazy
He gets a lot of heat but I like him
Oh they already have quarter threads. Check the title lol. Reddit might need an upgrade soon so they don't have to split up the quarters
Need Carter for the strip sack and Bellamy for the scoop and score.
That''s how it is on my Xbox, but on my AppleTV it just loses quality and doesn''t freeze. 
That'd be complementary.
I like baseball. I go to UGA. Go Dawgs. 
The WatchESPN app for PS4 it lags about every 20seconds and then jumps forward like that episode of Futurama with the time skips. I pretty much missed all of UGAs plays just now. It''s incredibly frustrating 
Aside from the Yuengling I had earlier? Nothing. Got work early in the morning.
It'll happen. Bama's front 7 is better than any UGA has seen. Gotta get them to respect the pass before we can run effectively. Unfortunately for us, the physicality and emphasis on S&C that Kirby preaches came straight from Darth Saban. Can't just pound it all night. 
Anyone else rooting for bama just because they want to see Atlanta throw another temper tantrum? Last year's superbowl was a riot. 
They stopped going to it after wims dropped it. 
Probably not
If he doesn't develop, I'd be surprised if Bama doesn't develop a replacement.  Hurts seems like a good enough Athlete to make it as a back or Tight End.  Thanks
I like Mayhem.  Anything is better than fucking Flo.
Zero touches for UGAs best offensive players.
There''s a lot of debate going on right now in our group chat about this. We claimed it was boos. People at the game said he got a standing ovation. People at home claim the sound on TV is better indication because it centralized.
Not if it works.
It would be nice to not need to be clutch though.
Anybody else attempting to watch this on watch ESPN? Shit is hilarious. I think I''ve seen less than 5 plays.
MAYHEM
MAYHEM'S BACK BABY pack it up that's the only reason I was here
Bo time... 3 and out
Youtube TV looks great stream btw
Only national title in 80 years is because they beat a 7th ranked teamYikesPower football school there
Happy NCG!¡!¡!
NATIONAL CHAMPS HANG THAT BANNER
Thanks. 
What broadcast should I watch???
Hey Mods! I think we are going to need a thread per 2 possessions at this rate!
Homers mega cast is where it''s at!!
Only if Bama scores and misses the XP
I don't know how to answer this. 
He thought he could get away with it during the game. Too bad for him you have to sober up eventually. Enjoy being 2000s Bama.
5 pass and 5 rushes?B A L A N C EALANCE
All hail the mighty AU eagles 
What kind of weird ass DBZ fanfic is this?
They made the thread 45 mins before the game started and it was at 2500 when it started.
Did I understand that Taco Bell commercial right?  Does a dollar at Taco Bell "just mean more?"
just run Bo every play right? 3-4 yards guaranteed
Different servers.Same thing with YouTube and Netflix and Hulu.Nevertheless, WatchESPN, like most things ESPN, is garbage.
I''ll join you on that. 
Mayhem is back baby
SHOUT
Irrelevant 
Awww it's alright man. You should try baked cauliflower with buffalo sauce if you want a healthier option. I've heard they're really good 
Why is this downvoted so much...
Stone IPA
Yeah, that guy has his shit together. He fucking killed it in college.
You don''t keep up. You just comment and hope you get some upvotes.
At some point you will regret that.
watchespn's code was written by univ iowa grads.
They tend to run out on the field and fight with refs and get a penalty, some coaches get a handler to stop them 
No
Dunno. I''d fuck flo
It sucks when your stream is 10 seconds behind the broadcast and you get spoiled every time you come to the game thread :(
COULD IT BE? IT IS! ITS MAYHEM, THE HOTTEST FREE AGENT IN THE WORLD!
I didn't see that. Sometimes they get fired up and the big boys who keep their cool know that the coaches shouldn't be chirping the ref all game. 
Bless your heart 
That I don''t know.  I''ve seen it on Netflix before
Bourbon 
You know what would be crazy? If they ran with Chubb
Mayhem is at least funny.
Watch one of the plethora of other broadcasts. The Homers broadcast has actually been pretty good in more ways than one
*Notre Dame reminded of 1980*Friendship over with GEORGIA
Seems like they're just trying to open the Run game
Good to see!Some of the best commercials!

Watch ESPN is amazing!
It's a loss leader. You go there high AF cause you heard about the $1 stacker, and you end up buying half the menu praying you won't get hit with that 'Decline' on the card swipe.
They've got something else on the U, only on ESPN3 from what ive seen. Well worth a quick watch 
I wish Bama's defense got tired... ever
I only buy my crunch wraps on the silk road
Let's not get crazy
HOLY FUCK HES BACK
Straight Basil Hayden for tonight. Whiskey/bourbon is truly ambrosia of the gods.
God I hope so
That''s why we look so good in the 2nd half almost every game. 
Run the dang ball!

Puking in the stands means he got his money worth. Puking in the stands also means he ruined the night for others.Eh, tomato potato

Your devotion to rivalry is admirable.
Dumbasses keep spelling it 'Hyundai' smh.
Yep.
For those of us who love defense, this is going to be a Great Great game. For everyone else, they're going to whine after the game that it was boring and the SEC is boring lol
saban looks like he was about to cry
 Bo time
just one?
I got a Herd on
I'm cranky that I don't have the film room :(
I''m pretty far into to drinking that beer thing.
I get wanting to switch it up but at least TRY the best thing your team is known for first.
Fight aboutta happen
Set up the run
Having the same problem with Sling.
What free site are you using? And definitely agree on the ESPN stream. It''s unreal how bad it is and I have no other way to watch..
What about an SEC dollar?
H-Y-U-N-D-A-I
Diarrhea
Tbh forgot Scarborough existed 
Man I wish Oklahoma could face Alabama. Seeing a team put up 50 on Alabama is something I''d pay to see. 
Bo is a big boy
No, I think UGA is "breaking tendencies" and passing out of run situations and formations. Not enough plays to say whether they're avoiding the run or Bama is stuffing it.
That was my guess try and spread them out and get a favorable matchup at the line but that isn't working too well
UCF
Main ESPN broadcast.  Full screen without the annoying side screens
seriously, mabye I live in my own bubble but I'd imagine the most often cited reason for getting slingtv is for live events, which they're incapable of streaming. Also, I only hate bama because they're so god damn good every year
These teams are like mirror images of each other. In a very literal sense, one team is mostly red with some white and the other team is mostly white with a bit of red.
Herschel gonna suit up at halftime and come out and carry it 20 straight times
Sounds of the Game sans commentators is nice.
I admittedly don't know much about Saban except a few memes here and there. I'm a bad football fan.That said, has he always looked on the verge of tears?
crunchwrap supreme
Said nobody ever 
There there buddy. You just need more whiskey. The next season will be here before you know it.

I like Mayhem better when he's the Vulture
Oh yeah go a little crazy Nick, you throw that screen pass.
yet you're here. thanks for joining us. hope you enjoy your time! 
Bama fans, how do you feel about Daboll? I haven''t heard much about him this season
Both of these defenses are designed to load the box and shut down the run primarily, running man coverage behind them to force QBs into making throws into tight coverage when the run game breaks down. It seems like we're coming out and trying to subvert that by beating tight man coverage first and foremost, forcing Alabama's defense to back off into zone coverage. Hopefully at that point, those play actions will turn into hand offs for gashing runs.Even if this doesn't work, keep in mind Kirby has shown an incredible ability to change entire gameplans mid game, adapting to what works and doesn't work.
UGA got running backs or was that just a rumor?
Running? Look, just because B1G refs are there doesn't mean they have to play by our rules.
ESPN skycam
They're trying to keep Bama guessing, but falling behind and having to keep passing.
Don't want to and am not going to
Not sure if serious, but he played for UofM. That was the joke
Like, I know the first few plays of the game are scripted and all. But couldn't you have thrown a few running plays in there too?
**#STEELRESERVEISN'TPISS**
Is there really such thing as a backwards pass.
Calvin Ridley like 35 now right?
Sideline warnings. NCAA can now throw a flag if the coach doesnt “get back” or is argumentative. Investing in a sideline coach is better than losing momentum over a penalty. 
UCF
Gf is watching, current chicks voice though
Usually is isn''t this bad. Way better than the FoxSportsNow app, which just crashes every few minutes.
If you're streaming the game and it's cutting out constantly watch the Dan LeBatard Show also on the ESPN app. It much clearer with no interruptions and they just bull shit around the whole time.  
Coaches film room > commercials 
Solid choice
Which will be too late lol
saaaaame
"Facebook is just for people to creep on people from high school". "Saban really wants to yell at Lane Kiffin right now." Sportscenter stream just shows the conversation instead of commercials. It's great.
Bo Scarborough the most underused potential 1st round pick ever.
I'm so excited for an SEC only CFB championship game!My guess is 17-10 Bama
Halfway through the 1st and I already finished all my wings.  Did I learn nothing in college?
To everyone having trouble with WatchESPN throughout the CFB Playoffs: Lol they're trying to start an online-only network in like 2 months
I''d fuck Flo
I'm streaming to my tv thru my cell phone as a hotspot. (Go t-mobile no data cap!) Watching on sling. It's pixelated but is displaying fairly well. Some dropping out every few minutes in the pregame show but none so far in the game.
UCF
2017: Not Clemson
Dude has a bright future he's going to be special
After tonight it's baseball season. 33 days? I can't wait. The Braves are gonna suck but Acuna is coming. 
As badly as I want Wisconsin in the playoffs I'm secretly terrified of how hard we night get rocked on the national spotlight if we end up with a scary match up. 
He's getting up there in age and I'm sure at some point he's gonna want to spend time with family. And all this stress has to take it's toll.
why is sumlin not talking more about these teams... 
So where is Eason going to transfer to ?
I love you for this 
They aight
Allstate's marketing campaign is amazing. HE'S BACK TO MAYHEM ALREADY!!
"not the most sudden back"... ie, slow
Having better 2nd string than most teams 1st helps.
Kraken
i think it just reaffirms my point
He pushed him and immediately walked away... smh
They be chippy. I expect to see fists flying
NOWHERE
Wake up DAWGS
Just keeps going in an out. Has to keep buffering ...likely due to the large amount of people trying to stream the game. 
fuck yes!
They keep trying to spread the defense. It looks worse and worse. I can't wait till they start running. 
It sure is, but not when I have work tomrrow.
Bama wins championships with their defense.  They lose them with their offense.
Lol horrible Playcalling
Lol I think Cutcliffe is wearing the ring he got with Tennessee in 98, because that is a huge thing he''s got on his finger
DAWWWGGGSSSSSS

Gotta look for that, I bet its great

Look at my flair
They don't know Bo
Sadly this game is going how I thought it would go 
God Damn that blew up.
#thats a loss
i left and went to a bar. just super pissed off i pay so much money to these crooks!
Roll tide I guess
Dilly dilly
I'm guessing UGA's saving it for later in the game, so Bama doesn't figure out how to counter the running game too soon.
It doesn't feel good.
FUCK BAMA
good ole run stuff
Chippy chip chip 
They use roadkill
Roll jackets 
JUNKYARD DAWGS

What channel?
Yea but your RBs are solid af...and a freshman is going to make mistakes on a stage this big. I hope Kirby knows what he's doing. Should be a great game either way
Oof that Georgia fan was so fine 
Fucking Daboll, getting cute way too fucking early
I'm not a fan of Bo. Harris is a much better back.
He doesn't run the ball silly.
Things that Georgia knew was coming for negative yards please, Alex.
hurts is hurting... amirite.. guys?... GUYS
No flags! Good! 
Yeet
Well that didn''t work.
Is Andy Reid coaching Georgia right now?
Good shit Dawgs.
hey bama i think georgia is catching on to the QB run
This seems just like a regular season game. 
THAT PLAY NEVER WORKS DABOLL IS SO BAD
great run stop
I like defense.
Sabans face has aged a lot in the last couple of years
Why does Saban look SO FUCKING SAD.
There's where the backup lineman comes back to hurt us

That looked like it hurts. I'll see myself out.
Does that count as a sack?

This game is so boring for a non-fan. Two stellar defenses and two inept offenses. I want another Rose Bowl air raid 
That stop just meant more
Okay Georgia now turn this 3 and out into 7 on the board!
Defensive football is sexy football
Some very questionable play calling on both sides

Was Hurts grabbing his wrist after that tackle?
Rip caterham09
I tried it but got the message I wasn''t cool enough.  Clearly an error message.
auburn 
Fair enough. Bama is expected the run, UGA is trying to loosen them up. If they run and Bama can stack the box, they ain't going to get shit. Plus, UGA's QB was ridiculious passing on first down in the last game. 
Bad play call.
What good is my parents login info if watchespn doesn''t even work smh
How can Alabama fans afford all these games, anyway?
Is Yale Blue?
If Bama relies entirely on Hurts to get big third downs they won''t win.
 I was sure Bo was gonna drop that. Nice recovery 
This game is boring. Where can I find the UCF game?
ooh hurts whacked his head on the ground pretty good there
Tf is that weak ass playcalling 
So... first field goal wins.

But if you do watch it, mute the movie until someone wakes up in a bathtub.  There is an opening monologue that dumbs down the movies and gives too much away.

Woo! Great stop D!

I'll take it. 
Have you tried the Warm Room?

Oh my maybe Bama's not the only team with a defense...
So they stay in the “coaches box” and off the field...it''s a fifteen yard penalty.
I already know what''s gonna happen next season. We will go undefeated for the first 9 games then lose the last 3 by 90 points.EveryDamnYear

10-7 off last second field goal. All points in 4th quarter 
Bonus is that you get to listen to the dulcet tone of Eli Gold's velvet pipes.
Don't let that sack distract you from the fact that Michigan ruined the B1Gs perfect bowl season. 
Well, patient, but yeah.
That play only works with a 105 year vet like JT. 
Though I kinda feel like i'm missing out.
Daboll doesn't have Rob Gronkowski anymore.
Lordy we need to not get any penalties on D...
Get the hell away feom that ball!
Man, is this going to be a boring game
He put da team on his back doe
Hurts may have a concussion 
Georgias problem throwing too much. Alabama's problem running too much
What are Bo's heroin tie-off's on his arm for?
Great stop!!
Pretty good show by the defenses so far.
Way to hold on 3rd!
Anyone else wish they'd penalize players for doing the "throw the flag motion"?

The best roll the Tide have gotten so far was on that punt
How's that Junkyard pain feel, Hurts? Hungry, swarm tackling Dawgs
Bama looking really average. Please win Bama
I don't disagree. But when has ESPN ever delivered satisfactory streaming services for something of this magnitude? 
This offense is fucking remedial

You could say it rolled to the Tide.I'm dead inside.
It just means more
I''m gonna need hardman to point out the ball to our gunners cause that almost hit him 
Hurts banged the back of his head against the turf, surprised the announcers didn''t mention it. 
Aww he tried to give that ref a hug!
Such an obvious play call 
The Bama fan on YouTube should do a live stream on how Bama fans watched the game
The best in college football. Duh
Sooooooo fuckin' glad Ledbetter got his life straightened out... guy's an absolute BEAST 
I'm hoping Crying Saban becomes a thing, he looked like he was tearing up

Defense!!!!
Even my brother that watches football maybe twice a year knew that was a QB keeper, pathetic.
Fucking commercial 
Where do you find that coaches bad boy 
#MORE COMMERCIALS 
Guess what. More commercials.
Is that what the mean by a Bama roll?
Agree.
Ledbetter is the G.O.A.T
That looks worse than our play calling. Saw that coming from a mile away
i do not agree
Barrett is older
The field goal probably would have won it for Bama. [Now we're going to get this] (https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/7657869/beamer.0.jpeg)

Am I crazy or could Saban go to the Hawaiian qb just to throw kirby off?
DAWGS SWARMING
I wonder if that sack....Hurts.I'll show myself out.
Everyone knew that was going to be a QB run
Big stop!
I agree. We wouldn't have won if he didn't break his leg last year. Why don't you use him more?
why doesnt the winner play UCF unofficially?
Where do you live
I''m Chris Fowler now.
T U AUA

Eject him
WatchESPN Replay
Oj Howard
I didn't know there were blackouts for games like this...sorry dude :/
Get that running game Georgia 
Can't wait for this 3-0 game.
The final score for this is gonna be single to low double digits isn't it
American vs Army 1 point game
Soooo.... does the dawgy express get any carries this drive???
Both OCs laying eggs tonight. Horribly unimaginative by Daboll. I called the draw play before it even happened. If I knew it, so did the coaches who get paid millions more than me.
Steve Wonder saw that playcall coming damn
Yeah I think Georgia sees it coming now
Reminiscent of the Bama/LSU championship at this point
Hunker down and run the damn ball!
TFL
Eh, it''ll be interesting to see.
"he'd rather punt the ball than turn it over" no shit sherlock
Quality commercial
10-3 jags?
Nephew 
There's that thing with the sour cream, beans, meat and cheese.
It's like that Limp Bizkit song says, you just gotta have faithUnless you would prefer Alabama winning tonight
Daboll, Running backs should run the ball. 
Jalen Hurts Locker
That's how you pull off a swim move.
The last non Army Navy game a president attended before tonight was Clinton at Arkansas vs Louisiana Tech.
what does that mean
Don''t come back 
Get fucked, Napoleon.
I don''t get espnews lol
Dadgummit Daboll, who didn't see that coming?
Damn that's weak 
Have both teams forgotten how to run?!??!
I believe Ohio State fans still view it as perfect.
Labatt Blue Light here! 
I'll consider it lol
Oklahoma-Clemson would have been an infinitely more entertaining game than this. 
Who would win:- ESPN's shitty streaming service- Some watchy bois
Looks like Georgia brought a defense too
Why hasn't anyone scored yet? 
Michigan division 1 football Champs ended 3-2, it could happen
Jalen's head bounced off the turf... watch out for Tua Time
Wonder how bad that hit was for Hurts.
Well Georgia can run. Alabama can't throw
And straight to another commercial
Crazy concept using your all star running duo that has ran for like 10000 combined yards in their careers. 
Boo this man !
T U AUA
That capital one  commercial was amazing lol
LMAO that capital one commercial was great  
Just got home. How many times have hey mentioned Fromms little league World Series appearance so far?
[deleted]
WE WANT WISCONSIN! WE WANT WISCONSIN! WE WANT WISCONSIN!
I will come to your home and slap you in the face 
-	sent from his couch at home 
I came here to drink beer and watch commercials
gAmeS wItH dEfEnSe arE sO BoRiNg!!
I didn't see the Twitch stream of that NFL game, but I'd imagine it was decent. Either provide a quality product or deal with people deciding to take their money elsewhere.
Great commercial capital one
I'm bored.
Bama  3-0  3OT
Stupid espnnews.
I understand that. Just think the game plan of using pass to open up the rush is wise. It's there. Execute on those plays and Bama lb can't sit in the box. Looking like it's gunna be a real low scoring game lol
They need to start feeding chubb
No plz stay
They can't. Bama attendance in 2009 was crazy, but since then attendance has been pretty low for these games
Damn that's a clever commercial 
My school also has a dog as it''s mascot, so I guess I''m a Georgia fan now
YOURE A NINCOMPOOP
Alright. Pistol set, run the damn ball
shitty play calling
Sick game folks. 
yes plz
Has to worry about the language barrier.
You make a very valid point... 
Well just throw in Eason 
Both teams have really good defense
Playing the long con
It's always the time. 
I heard he had short guy syndrome
Gawd I hope this doesn't turn out to be some 9-6 game.
Ill be happy when I dont see these Accord commercials again
Jalen Hurts is not a good QB
ESPN streams are such shit. 
Well umm...it's "Yale Blue." A dark azure. The rest of New Haven on the other hand..is grey. 
Lane Kiffin, COME HOME.
Think the RB motion was supposed to hold the backside end in theory, he didn't bite
Sumlin is in the coaching room? I'm glad we replaced him, but I seriously hope the man finds a new team soon. Good guy.
He's playing his son.
Would be the most SEC way to go
In terms of entertainment, the Rose Bowl was the real NCG
Alright that Capital One ad is actually good
Same. No one in the backfield means no shit Sherlock 
I have whatever the Louisville equivalent of a Herd On is! Thanks, Cardbro.
I'm 99% sure that's not how the Louisiana Purchase happened
My yellow lab already fell asleep.  What kind of sports fan is that?
This is like when Tim Beck decided he didn''t want to give Ezekiel fucking Elliot the ball anymore
Defensive showdown tonight. Love these types of games. Gotta earn everything tonight boys
Yawn
But I've only seen this commercial 65 times!
ah thanks matey
I love Honda so much
The offensive line fucked up that play. They double teamed a guy on the left when the QB was running right. 
yep, looked similar to Tyrod Taylor's concussion yesterday
I haven't forgotten
Superbowl_irl
Red Bull, Pizza and wings work? 
food stamps?/s
I feel like I underestimate how hard some of these guys are getting hit. Like I'd be dead right now if I were Jalen, but that wasn't even *that* bad.
[What a stupid sport](https://imgur.com/JDbqqbF)
If better is a never ending quest, why would I buy a Honda over an Acura? 
I would suck as a qb.  I'm more of a distance runner.  Terrible at sprints.
She replied "oh yes, you have lost something...You've lost....Your running game"BANG
Agreed
Get out.. 
He knows the odds of us winning drastic go down. 
Same
Not advocating playing dirty. But it is good to see UGA “finishing the play” even when the tackle is secured. Lord knows Bama gets away with a lot of that in the name of aggression and physicality. 
Fire Mike Stoops!
That capital one commercial was cringey
Only if Hurts throws 3 INT 
UK?
This isn''t even fun
B E A M E R B A L L
i actually like that song, but any song that gets played that many times is gonna get super annoying
Absolutely scorched
ah thanks matey
So glad I took the under in this game.
Dont worry the run game is coming they are just tiring out the lbs a bit
I'm feeling my second diarrhea coming on. Fuck fuck fuck I'm such a ball of nerves 
You're in luck!
me too thanks
It looked rough, hope he's alright. 
It could be like the finale for BMS!
most likely will be Dabo.
Go team beat the other team!
You guys feel that? That''s the winds of an angry Saban approaching.
Jaylen Hurns fucking blows and the idea that he can throw a football is for simple minded individuals...fact 
I see you're unfamiliar with "Run Defense"
What do you guys think if the Presidency of James Buchanan?Also, to keep this football related what happened to the Miami U dynasty of the turn of the century? 
God I hope we put Tua in. I've never been high on Hurts.
We rotate every few championships so we don't break the bank.
FEMA money
Georgia's good offense vs. Bama's unmovable D, and Georgia's good D against Bama's shit offense. Should be a hell of a game
This is fascinating because these two coaches know each other so well. It''s like chess between two guys who''ve known each other forever.
will be 0-0 at end of regulation
then you are in the right place friend.
Not a chance... 34-28
Our offense is doing everything it can to keep this game close
Oh shit what I miss? I got lost in a thread about whataburger for awhile. 
FLAIR UP. 
That rose bowl was epic. 
I don't know when there will be a truly amazing play in this game, but I do know that WatchESPN will freeze right before the snap and then skip to a crowd shot 
Anyone else having a crappy stream experience at the moment? 
Puns are the highest form of humor
3 way tie for national champions? I'm surprisingly okay with that haha
Well, with the current Red and White motif, you might be able to sneak in and nobody would know the better.
What offense?I don't know wtf Daboll is calling. 
I mean you're not wrong
faith wont save anyone georgia is going to get pummeled. 
Shiner Cheer!
Honestly hurts pass game is so bad that he should just try
Who do you think you are? My mother? My father? The guy at the McDonalds who told me I was "making a scene"?
Hurts has to feel that sac, his head bounced off the ground
Fuck off with your trophy commercials, Honda. 
If they don't play Centuries at least 5 times I call bullshit and am boycotting ESPN.
Oh, you mean one where the president had a connection to the schools?Fancy that. 
These low scoring SEC games are always boring. 
ah thanks matey
This game is awesome!!
Same. As much as losing to OSU sucked, the Miami game was actually enjoyable. We would have gotten smoked against either of these 2 teams 
Just kidding. I didn't say anything
And you're all out of beer?
its a fucking joke its so bad. 
I remember when he pinned us back in our own end zone all those times during the sugar bowl. It didn't stop us all night though! :D
Is it still the game
Dope Cap One commercial lol 
That capital one commercial was awesome
You know it's the national championship when people are talking about Saban's sad face. Y'ALL HAVE NEVER WATCHED ALABAMA PLAY BEFORE. 
Put in the Hawaiian. Jalen at running back, unstoppable
Did u see that right tackle totally miss that block!
Don t Think I've heard it once 
ah thanks matey
P H Y S I C A L I T YHYSICALITY
Is New Haven Grey?
Somebody is downvoting every single comment 
After the shit yesterday in the NFL, I don''t expect potential head injuries to be mentioned unless absolutely necessary. 
First to 17 is gonna win, aren't they
I can't watch the main ESPN stream ever during CFP games. The other ones work fine (watching the Alabama radio stream)
Coaches film room is the greatest thing ESPN has done since 30 for 30s
[I've been praying for a fight.](https://youtu.be/n4hB2Ae28dI)
If last week taught me anything it's that we're going to see this stupid Honda trophy commercial 50 times by the time this game ends
hurst almost got Tyrod Taylor'd
 If doing so takes down the target, no reason not to. 
For anyone interested, at 9pm History Channel will be showing 'American Pickers: Bonus Buys'
Can we take a moment to acknowledge that Georgia State is jumping on the UGA bandwagon from their [official university Twitter account](https://twitter.com/georgiastateu/status/949319570841534464)? I get sportsmanship and all that garbage. But you would NEVER see the likes of osu rooting for OU. At least Georgia Tech and Georgia Southern know how to hate properly.
ESPN channelling CBS' coverage of the SEC with all these commercials. 
Why would America get payment when we paid for Louisiana?
Is Hurts out?
A tiger is a cat but I'll take it
ah thanks matey
Yeah buddy
Priorities 
What''s with the mass downvotes?
Taking an ungodly shit rn, anything crazy happening?
SEC classic shootout. 13-10 final 
I agree.
Had a 30 minute special on it.
Alabama's kicker sucks balls and GA's D is good.
Boring-ass game so far.
Why would Fromm get injured 
ah thanks matey
Thanks fren
ESPN app on Roku sucks asssssssss
I hope I get to see the day where Bama doesnt even land a bowl game.
Very correct
Tech and UGA vs Bama?
Someone rejog my memory just how bad was that LSU-Bama NCG? 
How long until Saban tells Daboll no more fucking read options or draws...I'm guessing one more 3 and out and he just goes ballistic on him 
Clever, have an upvote.
exactly
Alabama considering playing their new backup Cake Joker 
If you go to Great Clips, you too could look as awful as that guy
[deleted]
That's some Chris Collinsworth logic right there
It's like that 9-6 LSU bama game a few years back that was technically a great game but boring af to watch as a non-fan
Excuse you???? 
"The Louisiana Purchase has just been approved!""WHAT SORT OF DEVIL SORCERY IS THIS!? BURN THE WITCH!"*So ends the illustrious career of third President Thomas Jefferson*
Jalen is awake. He's always this lethargic if you haven't noticed. 
ah thanks matey
Are there any winners in that scenario? 
[It also looked like he had some toilet paper on his shoe earlier.](http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/207/210/b22.jpg) 
Maybe the quest in a Honda is to a junkyard.
Real talk: the Louisiana Purchase was a hell of a deal. 
Fuck these stupid Honda commercials, taking a page out of the Nick Saban book of "don't enjoy your victories, just keep trying to top yourself forever!"
Well he CAN see outlines and shapes
They aren't that big of a dill
ah thanks matey
PSA: youtubeTV has a 7-day free trial and does not have the constant stuttering issues of the watchESPN stream. Not available in all areas, though
We are averaging more commercials than actual plays.  Fuck the dude in the red hat.
Julia RobHURTS
ever seen rick and morty?
Call it an educated guess based on watching Oklahoma's defense.
Is Tony expected to go pro after this game ?
That was me during the Super Bowl. 
ESPN news my dude
Not for the french
Shoulda won
Bama missed a field goal
WRONG
UK?
Someone hasn't spent much time in Alabama...
Is this going to be the "hold my beer" game to Jacksonville vs. Buffalo yesterday? 
Same. Great quality with PS Vue
YOU NINCOMPOOP 
That will do, thanks
Awesome, thank you kindly sir! And fuck ajit pai!
Clemson has a dog too? Meanwhile I couldn't tell you what my team currently is. 
YoutubeTV is wayyyyy better then any of the native espn apps.  Good lord.
with any luck it'll get Tua in there
Absolutely garbage 
I bet it Hurts
Link?
Notified that it went through.
Thought there would at least be a fake in there. Handoff or dropback 
"Love seeing...D..."
I wish I could upvote this a million times.
Because some of us think it's absurd that our tax dollars go towards glorifying soldiers during a spring event when there are homeless vets, vets with medical debt, vets who need psychological treatment and they're not getting it.
defensive struggle = more commercial breaks 
Here in Florida this is being shown as the Usurper's Bowl.
Trickeration
That's what I'm saying. Add a new wrinkle 
replying for answer
That was probably the most obvious 3rd down play of all time. Alabama offense is so easy to read. It's a shame. Wish they would throw Tua in, but they aren't going to do that to Jalen.
crazy, no way anyone knew Hurts was going to run it on 3rd and short with an empty backfield 
No no NO! You stop that. BAD DOG!
Yeah it''s really bad :/
Oklahoma anyone really.Oklahoma is the only offense good enough to put up a lot of yards and points against these defenses, and their defense is so bad they would ensure the other team would do the same as well.
It's saying the purchase went through 
Switch to the UCF game.
I remember when I used to go to Sports Clips & Great Clips, *cringe*.
Wow sports clips...That''s guys haircut still looks awful.So good job advertising an accurate representation of what a haircut from sports clips looks like!
He's in attendance!
That's Saban O face
I like driving in my truck
I've seen this goddamn Accord commercial with the talking trophies about 400 times this bowl season.
They should go for the tie.
Everyone
Doesn''t everyone?
How long until Lane Kiffin releases his inner troll?
Coaches want to see Georgia be Georgia and run it down their throats. Go with what got you here. 
Win^this^fite^tonite
Not gonna lie.  I''d like a gift like that. 
I hate Stanford. 
That might be the worst thing for Georgia.
Buchanan was a puppet of the New York political machines bro. Everyone knows this.
Man...I really wish it had been Clemson and Oklahoma. 
$35/mo seems obscene based on the commercials. It worth it?
Or devices 
Watchy Bois.
*ESPN app on all devices sucks! 
But why
My name Jeff 
We are going to try to bring this home to the rightful division SEC east bro
3-0 final. Bet me.
God I hope not
There was a whole pregame segment on it with baby Fromm 
God your smugness. You need to lose to get off your high horse.
ITT fans on both sides of the ball mad that their team hasn''t won after 2 possessions 
I honestly think both teams put all their eggs into winning their playoff games. I kind of expected an emotional letdown from both teams in the Championship game.    On the flipside, I think to a certain extent, OU and Clemson kind of looked past their Playoff games and it cost them. 
I could listen to Cutcliffe all day everyday 
**GOOD**
At the risk of sounding very /r/HailCorporate , that commercial was great and the capital one app actually is pretty good
Is Kirk Herbstreit the greatest oSU player of all time 
Back up. I think this is his first game:(
Mike Gundy looks like he's bored out of his mind. 70 yards total offense, wth?
ah thanks matey
Those statues in the Honda commercial look creepy. 
$$$$$
I fucking hate how it''s 2 minutes behind.
Who else boycotts commercials?
http://www.espn.com/watch/_/id/3267580/sounds-of-the-game-2018-college-football-playoff-national-championshiplegal stream, no commentary, no bufering (so far)
So much commercials. It's like watching a CBS on SEC game
That dude is tough as old railroad steel. 
I told my 7th grade girlfriend that once and she broke up with me. 
Ditto
For the Brand?
What the hell is 48 hr sweat protection
Wait, is it still the first quarter? 
Sucks on AppleTv also. It''s freezing every few seconds. 
C O WOLLEGE
The ESPN stream sucks, like everything else ESPN related. 
Never go to an online school that used a template for their commercial
I hope for a 3-2 game. Then the meteor shows up.
Pick six
Sure did...
Aww how sweet 
HOT TAKE: Chubb is a pretty good player.. he should get some carries
I'm all for more karma opportunities, but a 1st quarter thread? We better have one for halftime memes
what channel?
Watching the Dan Lebatard show makes this so much better.
I'm stuck at work until 10 at the latest. I'm not missing a lot, right? 
ESPN News.

C''mon run game!!!  Michel and Chubb gonna have to carry this game for us. 
Prove it
JA McArron 
I'm watching this game in Oklahoma, and shitty lawyer commercials are universal
ESPN app in general is absolute garbage
Gtfo
Same, what the hell is going on with their service. Never had a problem watching ESPN online (except quality) and now says not part of package.Thanks Net Neutrality :)
link me dad
How is it? I'm thinking hard about cutting the cord.
 We should start calling the Natty the Ultra Bowl
Good beer and pizza, but I'm not surprised no one is paying attention to the game. 
ahhhhhh (dats me yellin)
About to go back to rocket league
Til Bama scores on defense or their offense wakes up.
Yeah, I thought he lingered on the ground for a second. I'm sure that didn't feel good. 
What sort of wings? Aeroplane or aviary? 
Jeez half a scoreless quarter and people start losing their mind 
Yep I have had it since it came out. Very few issues at all.
Nope. 7 straight passes
This feels just like the Rose Bowl if you took the Rose Bowl and removed all the offense
DOWN
My criteria for a car   -does the AC work?
UGA about to break open a big play and hit that 7-0
Terrible haircut!!
P U P P E R 
Not at all
Uhhhhhh tigers are cats 
Yes.
We love you? Why hate your fellow elitist bastion of privilege?
Just remember the B1G went 7-1 in bowl season. Tonight, the SEC will get a bowl loss and a bowl win the same game! :P
let's go DAWGS!
> E SPN app ~~on Roku~~ sucks asssssssssFTFY 
Not as loud as it should have been, then. 
uhh... i have some news for you
Man, imagine the hysteria if Eason came in on a trick play and threw a TD 
And they are selling out against the run.
Everyone is
Let's let more than half a quarter be played before we call the game boring.
SEC SEC SEC!
UGA!!!
is it just me or are the commercial breaks pretty long?
Nope
Ah, so you **are** the McDonalds guy.
Jesus, already more commercials in this than on a normal SEC on CBS broadcast. 
Damn Alabama playing like shit come on 
check out the coach film room if you havent already. Make commericals so much better
I think it''s available everywhere now. It''s just big cities get their local stations in addition. Everywhere I''ve travelled it''s worked just fine and it changes channels based on it.
Yeah i couldnt find a single stream that didnt have problems
It protects you from sweat for 48 hours 
Preach it, all my Bama fans wanted Tua to start
Me too
Good doggo
These coaches in the film room need to spice it up.   “We offered #94 a Honda Accord but Bama beat us with a Dodge Charger.”
I have it on my iPad with the main channel on my TV. Nice set up.
Is it full of puns?
PlayStation VUE does too 
They've just repeated it over and over again, its been surreal.
Looking like Rodrigo for MVP
Pour les amateurs de football, la diffusion du Championnat national NCAA à TSN2 vaut la peine. Six entraîneurs réunis qui discutent et analysent la rencontre. Ça vaut la peine.The French like the Canadian broadcast of the coaches comments on TSN2.
GLORY, GLORY TO THE ONE TRUE DAWG!
The God of Chaos is present 
It's as close as I could get
ESPN app ~~on Roku~~ sucks asssssssssFixed that for you
Got Bama on their 1? You''ll get it back on your 10. Lord I hope they get another good punter when he leaves. Field goals be damned. 
Only acceptable  result imo. 
Way to judge a career by just two drives. 
G O O D B O Y E
Is jalen hurts highly regarded?
Mayfield would have fucked up that 'Bama defense.
I'm into it, let's do it.
Around 25m people watch the CFB national championship every year, which is about a quarter of the amount (100m+) that watch the Super Bowl, and about 2.5% of the amount (1b+) that watch the World Cup.
I take a knee for them
I heard Tua is declaring for the draft this year.
I dunno about that but we're definitely gonna see the Honda Accord at least 50 times
> I know it''s cold everywhere, but the cold here is even betterTypical SEC
ESPN app has n everything sucks assssssssLiterally no problem through pregame. As soon as kick off happens it freezes every damn play.
Nah
ESPNews :(
Can confirm. Is working great
I love lamp?
On offense, UGA needs to start running the ball. If they can do that the down field passes will open up
I've actually got a perfect one going ATM, although mine lacks commercials, so I feel like I'm not getting the full experience, lol. 
Something for the axe set.
Uga is fucking adorable
James Buchanan did a horrendous job of lessening the growing divide between the north and south imo
So cute 
Ha!
So you know that Oklahoma would score 7 for sure by now?
This thread is moving too fast, you guys are gonna have to learn to stop and smell the shitposts
this game *worries* me 
Never go to a school that has tv ads in general 
Yup. Tua can actually throw. 
No flair tho
I don''t think that''s how the Louisiana Purchase happened but I don''t know enough about Louisiana Purchases to dispute it 
I dream of a world where ESPN realizes that people would actually pay for their service if it wasn't broken as shit.
yes but nothing else does.
Aww 38 degrees what ever will you do 
Georgia: Hold my beer *throws INT*Bama: Hold my beer *misses FG*
Legend has it that you can still smell what the Rock is cooking.
Anyone else get these addiction commercials? They''re non stop and depressing. Lol
Let's go!
G O O D B O Y E
*uses clicker from Men in Black* what are you talking about 
Roof (dats ma doug)
I haven't seen any Nissan commercials yet. What gives?
Dude, I don''t even know what to say.  It''s the National Championship.  They sing the National Anthem.  It should be one thing we can all rally around.  But apparently not
Damn we're not even midway through the first and everybody's already acting like it's a sure thing this game's gonna finish with something like 6-3 as the final score. You guys do realize one of these teams played a 54-48 game last week in what was an instant classic?
Yes, but haven't we had enough of politicians on social media?
Is Jalen Hurts just a meme QB or can he actually throw a damn pass?  
This is the warmest it's been in the past 2 weeks. Sooo yeah it's a bit cold. 
Best uga 
Fucking finally 
Please, for the love of sanitywill you all stop making shitty puns with Jalen Hurts name
Wow look at that running helps
touchdown here dawgs
Reddit always reminds me that though I think something, someone else has thought it too. 
Dude looks like a French penis
Seriously dude, set your flair. 
That run gave me a half-Chubb
Finally UGA run...
Wow a run! 
A run!
That's too many words without a license, we'll see you in court.
I feel like people are commenting so much they''re not even watching the game.
THEY RAN THE BALL!!
Straight awful for me
A perfect 7-1 record.
I spy with my lil eye a Georgia run play!
You don't choose the AppThe app chooses to buffer and not show the game for you-WatchESPN
FEED THE CHUBB
bets on what happens first, me being wasted or one of these teams scoring?
great push up the middle
9-6 is my guess 
Uga a just getting settled down.
Sports Clips is the perfect sponsor for a Kirby Smart-coached game.
Holy shit watch espn sucks. I can't get through 30 seconds without it buffering. I have pretty solid internet speeds as well.
A lie that stinky people tell themselves
Lol
James Buchanan is basically blamed for not stopping a war everyone also believes had to happen to grow the country. 
Shouldnt that be 14,999,999 *TO* Napoleon? I mean, we bought Louisiana from the French so the money should go TO them right?
What would you like to lose?
By both sides... But to be fair, I'm not getting paid a few mil a year for my expertise
I remember when I used to pay for haircuts.
All these commercials it''s just missing uncle Verne chortling 
Remember that wide open Ridley in the end zone?
Can confirm, purchased Lousiana once
Get that Chubb goin
Sucked shit :(
Oh shit. They ran the ball.
Oh, I was unaware Georgia had running backs. /s
guys bitching about the commercials... if you watch the film room you dont get the commercials and instead just get football jargon
EAT CHUB EAT!
Wtf is going on on command center channel? Something about human feces?
Yeah, my illegal one is pristine pic, but it pauses a bunch. Espn data stream has poor pic quality, but doesn't pause. 
He''s giving me a big Chubb!
Spoiler alert Bama wins. UCF my champions though.
Maybe
Imagine what it would be like to go back to the early 19th with the capitalone app on your phone. The app itself would be fucking useless because no one accepted credit cards back then, but as long as you brought a charger for your phone you'd be like a God
Dilly Dilly!
Great athlete though. 
If you''re mentally handicapped, maybe.
At least I'll be cool
This game's gonna hit 4 hours, easy.
I'm getting really pissed off that ESPN is interrupting my commercials with football.
awwww a doggy
The guy drops back and scrambles, throws behind the line, or rolls out and throws up a prayer 95% of the time. He''s not a full time QB
For whatever reason, last week when I switched from PS4 app to Chromecast, I had no issues. But now both options are, as you said, poop
https://www.vosizneias.com/assets/uploads/news_photos/thumbnails/800_sl1wdoeasnxwrtr3nt5ci6pyptdxryqp.jpg
Flair up. 
What? No, that *never* happens
FOOBAWW.
I think they moved their stadium like 30 miles off campus, students stopped going to games, they got known for having a shit atmosphere, and players stopped wanted to go there.
He will show you da wae
This is kinda lame so far.
Not gonna lie in the lighting they're using at the stadium Georgia's unis look fucking sick
Capital One app shows what you bought with your credit card, commercial implies that America bought the Louisiana Purchase with a capital one credit card
Peaks head back in
Alabama will start to blow this open later in the game
BRICE RAMSEY TIME
Yup
I just find most UGA fans to be insufferable. I live in metro Atlanta. It''s just too much. 
What's Kendrick's set list going to be?
Run every down. If you lose, so be it.
Everything capitol one does is good  for me, from credit wise to their alert emails. 
Georgia is better because they have a doggy. Checkmate Tide fans
The forward pass was just a fad.
ESPN - "Best running back tandem ever. I expect a lot of runs"Kirby - "HMB"
Watch ESPN is terrible on all platforms 
Bulldogs just always look like they're in constant pain to me. 
Yo what are these guys in tights doing. I just want to watch the Kendrick concert
ESPN News or stream
This game is going 9-6 isn''t it
No sir. 
holy shit they must have two dozen different official streams
Georgia obviously earned the right to be here... but you can't tell me this game wouldn't be more exciting if it was Alabama VS Oklahoma. if only Lincoln Riley didn't shit the bed and call plays like a deer in the headlights... 
From Harry Potter? 
Muh player safetyz Please win. 
Lmao 94
Hot take UCD has a more explosive offense than both of these teams
https://twitter.com/sportingnews/status/950540110403121152
Pls no
Hurts isn't known for throwing though. He can make amazing passes out of scrambles, but his pocket passing isn't amazing
Pretty sure I just saw a Fallout Goul in that Maze runner ad. 
one issue with the coaches feed is that the game audio is too loud and you can't really hear the coaches clearly.
Going to go with wasted.
What is worse watching the same commercial over and over again or ESPN We will be right back screen.
Bulldogs are cute
NOBODY PRAY FOR ME
Keep feeding Chubb
Good stop
Same here
Well, your other choice is Bama
Well this is just the complete opposite of the Rose Bowl and my heart can't take any of this. 
NO YARDS FOR YOU
It gave me a Herd On.
holy shit 94 belly flopping onto the dogpile lol
Um, 94 leaped onto the pile after like the 3rd whistle.  WTF?
Boring
dam the bama swarm to outside runs so good
Watching on my LG TV with free trial from YouTube tv. Perfect so far... YMMV 
So fast to the edge.
pretty much
The defence in this game so far has been........outstanding 
The fuck 94…
PIG PILE!
I love that on the voices broadcast the Dan Le Batard group is only talking about what food to order at the moment.
This thread is running faster than the stock exchange ticker. 
Love, love, love, love and some love
Puking in the stands might make a good story
Dude Just belly flopped into a crowd of people. 
Okay.
I love those power formations.
Since when do teams in the SEC play defense?
ESPN app on any device sucks ass.
You 
yep watch espn is worthless for major live sporting events
So good, they beat UGA in 2014!
Both teams should just got I formation 
Jumping on the pile after the whistle...
That dog is cute tho.
Umm... flag for piling on?
Why don't they just score?
Dawgpile on Chubb
Live with 3. They are.
probably not far off. they're a genetic mess now
I''m from PA, and I''d kill for 38 degrees today.
Definitely not to the same degree. 
Is anyone streaming the game where we can actually watch it. ESPN sucks
A five yard run is UGA''s best play all game
Hey guys I don't think you got himTHUNK
Yup. ESPN app keeps freezing. 
It is the SEC. What did you expect.
S C I E N C ESCIENCE
Boy have I got the car for you. AC is Arctic air but there's no engine.
Cmon now that's a whole lotta man with a swan dive. Shoulda been 15
What is this the WWE with that body dive?
Nick seban remembers
Lol at that flying leap 
@JoeGoodmanJr: Talked to Alabama play-by-play legend Eli Gold about interviewing the President tonight. Going to ask him about the USFL and Herschel Walker, among other things. No politics. Interview might be after 1Q but that could change.
It's awful. The game is almost unwatchable for me. 
These games go disgustingly long due to the amount of commercials. This game will easily go past midnight eastern time.
I would have enjoyed it so much. So damn much.
Payne with the smash
very much a defensive game so far. 
Lol 94 just wanted a hug. 
Wow. Imagine running with Nick Chubb.
THUNDER
lmao that one guy jumping on the dogpile
Lol Payne jumping on the pile at the end. OUCH!!
Comparing a single game to an entire tournament is hardly fair.
The first half of the sugar bowl went quick.  Then they piled on the commercials in the 2nd... I guess I'd rather them distribute them.
Go to the commercial free Dan Lebatard Stream!
ESPN app sucks on everything. Roku, chrome, phone, ps4, pc... they all lag for me.
meme QB
94 had a blast on that play
Hard to go east-west on the weak side of the field against this defense
OH HAI DOGGIE
ESPN News is what Im watching it on
Bellyflop!
Should be a flag on 94 jumping on the pile
He just dolphin dived on the pile lol
94 the fuckGeorgia's the bulldogs, they should be jumping on a dogpile
This game is boring give me that ucf offensive firepower
BELLY FLOP!!!!!
haha! belly flop!
Watching this D gives me PTSD
First loko down
 the dude flew
James Buchanan was a weak-minded, flip flopping, soft president that pushed America closer to the Civil War.The U? The new stadium fucked them up, Going to the ACC fucked them up, Al Golden fucked them up, bans fucked them up.
Its because they are, they've been inbred so much they suffer constant health problems, it's a little sad, but they are cute as shitEdit: just like girls in Athens

What's this? A run?
Payne trampoline jumped the pile.
What everyone is here for...the Kendrick Lamar performance 
Payne doing his best Superman 
great run call
Well, a lot of them can't breathe and most of them can't breed, either.
Dude just swan dived on the pile
lol 94 supermanning onto the pile.
I just don't see UGA getting many points. They are even less dynamic than Clemson. Hope I'm wrong. 
There's that run game
Wow they finally figured out that they are good at running
Nice play call on 3rd down.
He''s the best. Truly. Everyone knows it, believe me. 
That guy has to go north and south to be effective... he aint no derrick henry
I guess 94 isn't gonna get flagged for that jump on the pile
They got a first down
<3uBAE
Splash diving on the pile is cool now I guess
You would too if it was that hard to breathe
This guy should be coaching
Should be a flag. Why jump on a pile like that? Could really hurt a player. 
Tackle made, whistle blown, three more Bama players comes in. So unnecessary!
94 should have been flagged
Just be glad it's not on Fox
1st down! It's happening!
Nice run 
Gary Patterson during the Rose Bowl was great too
let's go baby, nice run Sony
Fair point. Thomas Jefferson would be insufferable on twitter. 
I like Sony Michel
The ESPN stream is absolute cancer. I'm losing my mind here trying to watch this game, 
flair up idk whether or not to trash talk you 
Wow, who would've imagined that Georgia had a decent run game?
Lmao 94 jumping into the pile at the end
Turns out if you do the things you're good at on offense you pick up yards. Who woulda fucking thought
ok I'm going to bed, no one spoil the ending but I'm pretty sure that Chewbacca kills Kylo Ren
>The ref says "I'm from the Big Ten"So nobody wins... 
Prediction: UGA wins 6-0 on pick 6 in octuple overtime
https://twitter.com/iamzgo/status/950452805524951043
This ESPN stream is trash.
Georgia uses rush. It is effective. 
Show me on the doll where the Tide touched you 
Who says Canadians can't play football
What scenario happens first: a) A G5 team makes the CFP orb) ESPN finally fixes their damn streams
My girlfriend just said she wants Georgia to win because Alabama wins too much. That's the kiss of death for them
Napoleon wasn't known for his internet shopping ability
This run is working for Georgia. Better throw it.
Chubb is such a fucking monster. I''ve seen very few in recent years that can be so physical against multiple tacklers.
Georgia finally realizing that their running game is their bread and butter.  Feed the beast.
Georgia: "I'll try running. That's a neat trick!" 
Damn good call 
Isnt it a penalty to jump on the pile like that
Lol, wtf was 94 doing?
Running the ball on Bama? Witchcraft! 
Sure ain't watching the rose bowl..
1b was viewership for the World Cup finals. Measurement for the entire World Cup was something like over 3 billion.
I know I''m new here...my bad 
Somebody put out some cracker barrel country fried steaks and gravy in the bama locker room at halftime to slow em down. Give em that 'itis
Michel is a grown ass man holy shit
Sounds like my girlfriend :(
I don't understand how RBs keep their knees healthy for even a single season, judging by how hard they get tackled. It's just supernatural.
People expect a lot from a national championship game.
94 just jumping in there.
Just belly flopped the pile...
Dawgs score on this drive don''t @ me 
Well i know we didn't get 14,999,999 FROM Napoleon to "purchase" Louisiana, they had the wrong word on the app
I''m just wondering how he''s going to censor his performance.
I'm here to answer questions, but cooking dinner, so I may miss a play or two. Animated gifs or videos of questions preferred.
94 believes he can fly!
fuck man, that's bullshit. it was good in years past. It's been snowing for 12 hours straight where im at. roads are crap
Snorlax used slam.Jesus dude you are going to hurt someone. 
Tosses don''t work when everyone runs a 4.2 on defense 
No penalty on 94 just jumping on top of the pile after the whistle?
Props to 30 for actually being able to tackle him.
Doing something that actually works!
Yup same here. I like my quicksilver. Now can I have more cashback for promoting you on Reddit, Capitol One? 
Ayy Sony lmao
Hot damn. UGA fooled everyone right there.
could barely handle regular season games. sure it's straight dying tonight from the number of people using it
great delay call
Look what happens when you run the ball
That should be a penalty. 
That was so last week. 
Same here. It was like 32 here today and it felt like a heat compared to the last 2 weeks 
"force chubb back inside...." 
[Every time I hear "stay on schedule"](https://imgur.com/AhgZ3F4)
Not today. Not with these teams...
that last guy jumped on... DAWGPILE!
No
I love football. When a team touches down I think "yes" when someone is tackled I think "no"
Right? That's why I got the Self-Cut System™.
I know the refs kind of let them play in games like this and try not to get involved. But that Alabama DL just belly flopped onto the pile wayyy after he was down
"there ya go r/cfb, we ran it"
Life pro tip for the people contemplating suicide due to watchespn....make a sling account. They have a 7 day free trial. 
Keep running it Dawgs!
Georgia with the play-action *run*...?
Georgia running it and its working?? fucking WEIRD! /s
A!
Comedic affect. 
IS PAWWWLLLL INVOLVED?
This Michel guy is pretty good 
That makes sense. Army-Navy probably has had quite a few Presidents attend. Thanks.
Can I just watch neutrally?
50 minutes into the game. 6:24 still on the clock WTF
Alabama doing a little headhunting out there 
SEE WHEN YOU RUN THE DAMN BALL BOBO? 
Lots of holding on the right side of the Georgia line.
Watching UGA run is so entertaining
Whew.
big 94 with the spider monkey jump
Dog pile!!!!!!!!
Run the ball and defenseSEC fans must be jerking off rn
Not sure if Alabama''s offense is bad or Oklahoma''s offense was great
Trick question, each are equally likely at 0% chance 
Run on 3rd down? Somewhere Tim Beck is rolling his eyes 
c) the sun explodes
No engine or wheels as long as the AC works
Boy that Playstation Michel hurts when he hits someone, doesn't he?
First to score wins
itshappening.gif
DSHJKLWNXWQUEDIO WATCHESPN IS SUCH GARBAGE
Or if we'd put someone who won their conference in the sugar bowl.
 Oh wow running the ball with your superstar backs works. Huh. 
So with this defense, first to 7 wins?
Hell yeah Sony!
No flag for jumping on the pile after the whistle? Guy easily weighs 300lbs
Ugh. I think the puppers may pull it out. 
Love it. Run the ball Georgia, and if Bama beats you at your game, then so be it.
Damn, nice hit at end. Glad sony held on
Wonder if Sony is an Xbox or PS4 guy
Why is the Watch ESPN app such shit? It's completely unwatchable, having to use an illegal stream instead.
IMO Michel is far better than Chubb
come on dawgs!
Don''t know about this game, but if one of the non-usual broadcasts is available: skycam, whatever else, pick that. It worked for me in the Auburn-UCF game a lot better
ty
let's go, keep eating them yards up boys
Great leg drive from Sony
Run Dawgs, run!
Your logic is difficult to argue against.
Oh shit, a *Black Panther* special trailer after Kendrick's performance?Fuck this first half. Give me halftime. 
I dont question their desire, i question their disposable income.  
Feed Michel that man wanna eat
A)
Not gonna lie, I had a snarky response ready about running the ball if we didn't convert that
I did this too!
Why lamp?
Do you mean Ernest T Bass?
Those screens in that stadium are really cool. 
Glad to see Michel has found success after Dodgeball
What you cooking ref-bro
I don't feel so good
I'm a sooner fan, talk all the trash you want you guys earned it lol. 
Run offenses make me hard
Neither forever
[deleted]
Why is "killing people is bad and wrong" such a difficult concept for you?
So the seven straight pass plays seems to have had the desired effect.
Im doing this. Thanks
Ok, you cannot run three straight draws.
Isn''t boding well for my first day back at school tomorrow 
"The running game is really clicking.  Time to air it out."  - Andy Reid
God damn those backs run like a truck 
Love fucking my cousin!!!! ROLL TIDE BABY
Link?
aTm and Texas play again could have been used as well
For sure. The more anonymity people have for their shittiness, the worse it gets.
Just run it AWL. FUCKIN. NIGHT!
Pssh, i dont even care about the world cup
Oh yea I know he's an amazing athlete but he's not a very good quarterback
94 channeling his inner Jimmy Snuka on that play
I just wanna be on the game thread overlay video.
Dude looks like my penis after a summer in France.
Hey did you know those guys are called Thunder and Lightning? 
I really like the “graduate” patch
c) heat death of the universe
watchespn's code was written by Iowa grads
For real, i was appalled 
Chubb just felt the Payne
It's still 0-0 take deep breaths
Even a coach like dabo means a big wake up call. Clemson is 50-7 over 4 seasons with 3 playoff appearances, 2 championship appearances, and a national title. Bama is 52-5 with 4 playoff appearances, 4 championship appearances, and a national championship (with another possible tonight). If you look even farther back, the numbers are even more skewed. Clemson comes up with similar records but the postseason production is unrivaled by any coach/team in college. 
Damn I'd have loved to hear him talk Defense
33 minutes
Lots of holding in general homie
It's garbage on every single platform
I was imagining a tooth for tooth side on both sides of the ball since it''s the NCG, but then I remember, I''m watching two SEC teams. 
You're really cool
Gotta keep feeding Sonny. Chubb aint doing it for them
This Sony guy is pretty...pretty good.
They're opening up the pa pass 
I was signing up for a sling tv account right as we missed the FG.  I am so over the buffering every 15 seconds.  
Same, I've had the Self-Cut System™ for 10 years now and it works great! Hell, I even got married! Thanks Self-Cut System™!!!
Well boys strap in its defensive game
This is why I wanted OU/Bama. At least see if they could pass.
I feel like Georgia picks either pass or run before each drive...
Avengers Infinity War trailer would be lit
Lock Alabama in the locker room, come out at halftime in our white unis. 
Play action incoming 
Kickoff was closer to 8:15/8:20....still pretty slow though
We'd probably see dinosaurs roam the Earth again before all that.
Shocking.
Don't have a question, just wanted to say thanks for taking heat every week to out up with us shitty fans.
I''ve been channeling them my energy all day. Hopefully it''s enough. Good luck next year. CFB is better when Texas is relevant. 
It's been shit for me all year. 
r/cfbstreams
G5 team...maybe 8 team playoff.
go hokies
That missed FG might come back to haunt Bama. This is not going to be a high scoring game. 
If a run on 3rd and 5 against Bama wouldn't have worked every other comment:"BAD PLAY CALL"
I''ve never considered Michel just a “speed back”.His physicality has always impressed me.  
Watch the Spanish version, no buffering at all. 
Sony Michel98 Speed99 Agility99 Acceleration
Every time Georgia runs it I feel like their backs get tackled by like 10 white jerseys
Probably PC. Winners make good choices
Yeah but I don't get ESPNews and the streamers don't have it.I'd kill for the officials booth one from a few years back, but I want Gundy so much.
Fromm with the pump fake on the draw to open up the run. Love it.
Nintendo.
I'm ready. 
Michel was better against us than Chubb, looks like it''s the case today as well.
that hole was not open for business for that Chubb
 He looks legit 
Against a team without much of a defense. 
40 minutes of commercials
What game?
You can if your name is Tim Beck
Winner gets a threesome with both teams' sisters.
Supa Fly!!
@DoctorHolliday subscribe
Game didn't start at 8. But yeah.
University of California-Davis did score a lot this year
Out scheming Bama, I'm all for it
Lmao I thought you wrote “blacks” for a sec
Chubb needs a little room to get going. Not sure if he's going to get it much today
c) The heat death of the universe
Sega 
SAD!
No need to downvote opinions you disagree with, though. Especially one as uncontroversial as his (outside of Reddit). 
Switch.
Who'd imagine that the run game will start to look good when you pass the ball around and prevent Alabama from stacking the box. Who'd imagine that? Oh, an OC worth his check. 
You underestimate Chaney
What's the vegas line ?
I havent had a problem streaming any game available this season, it's been great. I just hope it's easy to cancel once basketball season is over.
Any time they mention the Rose Bowl, I''m taking a shot. Of bleach 
[deleted]
Yup
This game is unwatchable on ESPN
OU played with a chip on their shoulder. Look how that ended. 
What a unique set of nicknames...
SHIT. They remembered they were good at running. 
Switch 
You know he enjoyed saying that.
Dang I wish I could be watching a stream of this
yes

Georgia acting like a pokemon learning a new move. Georgia Bulldog learned "RUN"
georgia can't win this game. Us Atlanta fans must always suffer together.
Hot take the game end 3-0 with a Georgia field goal 
BUT ALABAMA PAYS REFS, RIGHT?
Ffs
It was however a lovely belly flop. Not sure when I last saw one that blatant. 
yep it's on in the background 
Fuck a bunch of Oklahoma
It's crazy they try and fight chord cutters but drive people to pirate
Yeah but that doesn't mean UGA is mediocre.  They are borderline blue blood.  I know you aren't OP, but to say that Georgia is mediocre is wrong.  A mediocre program is Iowa or Louisville.  Not UGA
Is ESPNs stream horrible for anyone else?
auto 1st down woot woot
RIP
YouTube TV as well.
buffer buffer somehow there was an interception buffer buffer missed field goal
Thanks B1G Refs
I am amazed Tide doesn''t advertise with Alabama 
Run UGA! Run! 
Yeah I saw that too. #94 piling on there really late. 
Looks like the UGA staff finally realized that running the ball with their best players is conducive to their success
"You can't do that"
I love how this ref explains all the things.
Is anybody having problems with Watch ESPN?
That too... 
We don''t get it and somehow I have a stream of it... try the site? 
This playoff is the first time I've ever watched Sony run. He's uhhh....he's really good
Is there a way to turn these guys off on the side?
Why you gotta bring color in to it?
"Fuck Bama" - refsI concur.
got a nice little break there
lol this ref goes into so much detail 
Dan Capron is the MVP thus far
Lets go
I'm confused, why didn't Georgia run a QB draw?
I appreciate the detailed explanations this officiating crew is giving us.
That is some crisp mid quality on the ref!!!
Wii
Too bad we couldn't see the fight between bakers chip and bamas dline chip.
I feel like we have been a fantastic team this year and Russel Wilsons year but the top 3 or 4 teams are sometimes just in a whole other level of football. 
I want to see him play Blacker the Berry just to piss off the people at home
Love this ref 
A. No question. 
I appreciate the thorough rule explanation
This man is the college Ed Hochuli
Tell that to me in NCAA 13
best record ever!
i like these big 10 refs better now 
[deleted]
I like these refs.
Now UGA did the same thing and it was a false start for us, bullshit. 
Fuck Tony brown
Good call refs 
The only way to watch the game.
Thanks, Bama. 
Well... no contesting that... at least it's not PAC12 refs
Now that's the Tony Brown we all know and love.
Not the only missed field goal that hurts them.
Dude came in like he was jumping off the top rope 
Killing his gf and getting away with it?
did we really need an expert to explain that
After the OU game I'm abSony fan now
Just dangerous 
thanks
Not as far as I'm concerned.
Y'all gotta wait to roll
fast offense does damage
SlingTV free trial
When UGA does it, our penalty.When we do it, our penalty.
r/CFB fans, would you root for Bama to win this game if Saban said he''s leaving if they win?
So much explanation for a Neutral Zone Infraction 
I really like the SEC Graduate patches... great job by the conference to give those guys that little bit of extra recognition 
Name a better duo tony brown and a penalty flag. 
Thanks John Madden!
Bama fails gives me a Chub
This is the worst I've ever seen it. Literally unwatchable. 
99 trucking
It is early yet. 
This guy is no beef ref but he''ll do
lol godwin just like "cmon man"
I regret that I only have one like to give 
SlingTV is working fine for me.
Ugh Tony
That penalty was huge
He just got Mark Sanchezed
First down. I''ll take it!
That 2018 championship logo is so fugly
bama -4
gonna pass on some wisdom that helped me: YouTube TV free trial. I did it last weekend and still have it. 720P no hiccups, no drops in quality, no loading screens. Just clear picture and no real lag (unlike watchESPN). You can cancel before the week is up
I missed my opportunity to make a "Hai, doggie!" joke earlier. Damn.
Wow, this game is so physical! Every tackle is a hard tackle. I love it.
There''s the chip on the shoulder! DRINK
K
Classic. Gundy: "Might as well take a few shots and live with it."
it''s awful confirmed 
You''re right. I''ll call it now. 54-51 Georgia.
Swift gonna be the man.
Naw, maybe a field goal or two.
Watch it on ESPN not ESPN 2
I don't think Georgia knows de way 
That call sounded so.....professional. Like the way I would talk in a serious job interview.
Gifting UGA first downs seems like a terrible idea.  Get your shit together.
not in the first quarter at least
Nothin Finer in the land!
Damn Nick is going to give him a KIA instead of a Mercades for that.
Alabama defense is still way too amped up
>this is a mitch match
this is gonna be classic sec defense grind it out
dam payne just fucked that run up, lol
I'll shill for them
I'll take that disciplined no rat poison Alabama free first down!
Damn that was a deathbringer tackle
Colored? What the fuck
I swear the dude with the glasses and Gatorade cup stays by Saban the entire game just to be in the camera frame 
Payne is such a monster. I love him. 
Good job Tony Brown making Beaumont proud
RIP /U2000notOk
we did not but ESPN did
We didn''t go into the neutral zone 
"This is a mitch mash"
I'd say it's worth it
Oooo new shit from Georgia 
94 needs to chill the fuck out a touch
Mish mash.
Experts explaining neutral zone infractions. Such a boring game 
What do we want?2 field goals each!!When do we want them?Each quarter!
[Hmmm](https://i.imgur.com/BUswvwF.jpg)
That corner is about get a national championship level ass chewinf
So that''s a first round DT looks like.
Hey, all the yards count the same
Aaaaaand there's Tony Brown being a dumbass. Shocked it took that long
Payne is literally EVERYWHERE tonight
Just as I suspected. **Boring as fuck**
UGA was 2 yards outside the neutral zone
That 94 is a Beast.
Might wanna double team 94
payne said no go, lol
#94 is fuckin huge 
Is number 94 draft eligible? He's a freaking monster.
Guys, UGA was passing the ball around to loosen up the defense. That's why the running game is looking decent.
I missed that false start...should have had my tac glasses on.
Skycap on espn3 is so much better than espn. 
Loved the penalty explanation 
Phrasing 
Is that a joke?  Didn't OU have the top offense in the nation?
That''s a big boy. 
Dead meme
Throw 7 straight times then run 7 straight times Greattt
dey do not kno de wai 
Bama -4O/U 45
It didn't look like he crossed the line but I'm like half blind
>	I''m here to answer questionsHow are you today?
94 is good at fooseball
who is 94? dude is a beast 
Wait why aren't we just using SEC refs? Not complaining that was a good call
Do you know de way?
UGA wasn't near the neutral zone. It was 2yds behind the line
The coaches corner with Cutcliffe and Gundy is epic
We are gonna officiate your game for ya...
They actually do in Tuscaloosa. They have a Roll Tide truck that rolls around constantly.
Rip in peace
I've tried the ESPN app on PS4 and the Watch ESPN app over my phone and all I get is 5 second snippets of HD before it fucking freezes and then skips ahead. Is this par for the course or is Comcast throttling me up the ass because I refused to upgrade to their streaming shit?This is fucking shit dudesEdit: Switched to the "Sounds of the Game" stream. No freezing so far and honestly a better experience without the announcers. Peace has been restored. 
Payne for 2018 CFB MVP?
He's appealing to the national crowd, I like it
Sony Michel's parents named him after a gaming system
Not much room to run so far.
But UGA did it earlier and it was their penalty.
That ref can really enunciate well
The way he worded that ruling just made it sound like he wanted to show off that he knew the rules.
Yep. One was within one yard, one wasn't.
...isn't that what happened on the field goal?
Who honestly says that shit
UGA didn't jump into the neutral zone.  Come on, dude.  The Bama dude did.
We''ve got ourselves a Mitch match, boys!
We drivin bois
I just checked their rosters, and Georgia's gonna be running 2 Elite level RBs with 5 star ratings, and on top of that, they came by to the store today and picked up 3 B1G refs, with a Freshman QB and a coach who knows Bama
Encroachment
People that bet the over must be about ready to jump off the building
great thrown Fromm
B1G refs tend to be the best refs IMO.
hey its that big receiver from last week
I can't even start it. Try /r/CFBstreams. 
Ridley the Younger!
Bama what are you doing.
as far as recent DT's go for bama, how good is payne? 
You''re welcome 
Can't believe he held onto that
I would rather have Alabama win another championship, than UGA fans, I could tolerate Bama fans
I legitimately saw a Georgia player pull the same shit on the play before the missed kick... be consistent at least 
A pass
Georgia lineman is getting abused
Lol that WR got spooked. Makes sense when it happens to a lineman, their natural motion is to back up. The WR was supposed to be going forward on that play
toughness
I'm not talking about their desire. 
fuck bama literally nfl players go dawgs
Tony Brown why
I'm impressed he held onto that
Wims, like elise wims from hells kitchen
Its just getting started 
T. Brown giveth, T. Brown taketh away
That was literally the EXACT same fucking thing Georgia did to Alabama.
You get any of the NBC sports family? I want some Olympics.
See Georgia passing works better when you run the ball too!
Damn, drilled from both sides 
Can't watch due to work tonight, but the box score looks like it is trending to be a similar game as the 2011 LSU vs. Alabama 9-6 OT FG fiesta.
Looking like Jags vs Bills.
great throw, great catch, let's go baby
payne
Can we have like two or three Daron Paynes, please?
FG play they didn't enter neutral zone
I forgot, georgia and who are playing again?
Bama is throwing a lot of Elbows out there
Guys these teams might be good at football
Run! Run! Run! UGA
Tony Brown, go to your room and think about what you've done.
everyone
Georgia better start scoring soon because this is Alabama's type of game... they wear your ass down then when you're weak they pounce.we were losing by 6 going into half time, we ended up losing by 46.FSU was losing by 3 going into half time... they ended up losing 24-7.Wisconsin was losing by 7 going into half time, they ended up losing 35-17.etc.
So far I've seen the coaching staff be 2/2 on catches 
finally he caught one, hopefully he got the jitters out with that
Its wild to think a year ago, this QB was in high school, now he's on national tv with most of the country watching. 
I''d like to see a 30 for 30 about the guy that has to hold Saban''s Gatorade cup and follow him around the whole game in case he gets thirsty. 
Good play
Coaches film room mentioned doing a pin and pull against bama. I enjoy.pin and pulls against bama
hey, fromm can hit open receivers. Must be nice
Jesus Christ how strong is Dashawn Payne 
Is ESPN down in anyone else''s area? The screen went black ten minutes ago and hasn''t came back yet.
Da'ron Payne. Dude with the int and Fat Man TD last week
How much would it fuck with Bama if Georgia just started running the triple option out of nowhere?
Jalen Hurts can't pull this off
Yikes. Hard to make a catch when you''re being mugged.
That looked like OPI, great play to get back on the ball.
WatchESPN has been trash all season.
DAE: Calvin Ridley's brother plays at Georgia?
We should cover them
I wish I was enjoying this game more.
I would have died from either of those two hits.That WR just tanked both of them, then gained 2 more yards. Jesus.
STFU Kirk. We all know you cheated on your wife you unrespectable piece of shit. 
For a freshman that was a really good read of the defense.  Saw man, called it.  stood and delivered it.  is he really a freshman or do I have that wrong?
Bama secondary is awfully handsy
This is seriously insane. I make a comment, scroll down to find it and it''s already 200 comments down.
Mugging wims 
Ah yes, a jump ball against an Alabama defensive back. Great idea!!! /s
Lmao I'm doing the same thing. I have no idea what the announcers are saying but the EMOTION is there.
I like Georgia''s Ridley more.
How are you watching it with the game?
I can't wait till Nintendo Daniels busts out onto the scene
At least get it right. Sony is the company, Playstation is the gaming system
[Leaked picture of the end](https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/e4SHSZevtNcMqjjbkLv7XdZTqM8=/0x0:599x337/1600x900/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/52322037/beamer.0.0.jpeg)
We never got into the neutral zone
This stream buffers either every 2 seconds, or two minutes, no inbetween, and it''s driving me crazy. 
Bama's defensive line looks like you'd need some construction equipment to move. 
Imagine betting the over in a game between two SEC teams though
FUCK PAYNE. That was amazing. 
B1G if true
I should hope so.
Georgia just did what LSU couldn't do in their all SEC National Championship game vs Bama, pass the 50
You hate to see that
Seahawks fans also dying
He's practically a video game character so
The *best* gaming systems.Dank parents.
Whoever points harder gets the offsides call
How was Ridley standing after that hit?!
Is hurryup a word.
Fuck the aggies!
These audibles are going to make or break Fromm 
Heat death of the universe
That's Calvin's brother?
It's normal. Sign up for the sling tv free trial and cancel it after tha gem. Best decision I've made tonight.  
UCF
5 step drop on shotgun lol, and still got pressure. 
Mike Gundy's mullet is the most perfect thing on earth
I've been watching games on Sling pretty much all season, and it usually seems to do pretty well.
Georgia is aware that's not Stafford under center yes?
GOODNIGHT 
DOMINATED
[deleted]
Refs doing a good job of letting the boys play.
You know that old joke when a woman has a bad date with a guy and says jokingly she might be a lesbian now or however it goes? In my case the WatchESPN app is so shitty I might not care about Sports anymore. 
I'm stunned by the lack of cousin banging jokes ITT. What happened to you guys?!
I''m a Jags fan. But yea. That was u g l y.
Of course, i'm just disputing the idea that this is bound to be a boring game
Ouchie
God damn BufferESPN.
Monster sack
SACKED 
Damn
I have had success watching the streams with local radio calls.
Honestly the Rose bowl ruined streaming live with ESPN for me.
"Contact my provider to upgrade"
Nope, that's espn streaming this year
An electronics company
Why?   You want a military.  Next gen comes from young fans.  This is how you keep an all volunteer military.  Besides, tons of us really love the military/patriotic aspects to our sporting events.  I don''t know if you remember when we all appreciated it but I am sure Pepperidge Farms remembers. 
Still up here
fuck
MONSTER SACK
The defender never went into the neutral zone during the field goal
Well my day is made 
ATTABOY
MOTHER FUCK
Who should the Detroit Lions draft with the 29th overall pick (realistically) 
If WatchESPN was a person they'd be the kinda person who doesn't return their shopping carts to the corral and waits until the last second to signal a turn, slamming on their brakes and causing you to almost asshole them in the process.
Wims doesn't seem like he's very good.
God, I hate it when they cut a play in half just to show a mediocre replay
Holy cow THAT was a suck
LETS GOOOO
YIKES
Damn
it's completely unwatchable for me right now.  I don't get it.  
oh shit, yeah, I had forgotten about that 
Ala**D**ama.
RIP drive 
Someone tell me what's up with the WWE belt on the sideline?
Thats one of the best sacks ive ever seen
Nah watch ESPN has been garbagio all year
DAMN
untouched 
What's edge protection
Wow no idea it was coming.
loss of 10,000
Why arent the rankings on the scoreboard?
no no no, aghhhhhhhhhhh
Poor jake gonna get killed if they don't run it more
#C''mon
Fucking shit
Got him!
That's a strong man.
How did we move the ball on either of these D''s?
I love that song!
LOL YOO
2nd and 5 miles
When Fromm is sacked, I say, "no."
I drunkenly emailed ESPN a few weeks ago, asking how much money I would have to pay to have a flawless ESPN app and have no commercials. They''ve yet to email me back.
It's the App, it's garbage, I'm about to switch to an illegal stream of some sort
Not blocking the Bama rushers?  That's a paddlin'
dude's got speed
and as soon as I post this they go back to their side lol
This triple screen shit is awful 
BIG BOI
They show the game on screen too
Fromm has looked really good. Bama is going to get home sometimes, they are a killer defense, but Fromm ain't shook. He is taking shots and has the nuts for the moment 
Oof
Fromm didn''t have a chance. 
Ouch. 
Zuppa Toscana in the pressure cooker.
Ehh shit not looking good lolEdit nm lol
Random Les Mis there.
Fair... I''m sorry 
Two tackles still gained yards what the fuck
Jesus shit Kirby he's not Matt Ryan.
We''re bored 
Looks like it's just gonna be a defensive showdown. Who will blink first.
That's not the right way Georgia. They clearly do not know the way.
Georgia Tech showed up because the game is in Atlanta
Had to mute this game. Tired of listening to Collins and Murray wishing their careers were better lol
These defenses are coming out hotEdit- nevermind
I'm sure the crew was picked long before they knew who would be in the game, so they were ensuring a neutral crew
NEGATIVITY is my ritual. :D
Wow that db anchored himself to Wimms' shirt collar to stop himself. No pi. 
dude came in like a missile! 
someone pm stream?
Watch ESPN is total garbage this year. All my streams work perfectly except ESPN. I'm at a bar watching because the stream is unwatchable
Hot damn that was a great sack
Difference between 5 star and a 4 star isn''t much more than natural athletic ability. An average 4 star is just as good as a 5 star except with maybe a small speed difference. 
Georgia doing their best Seahawks impression blocking wise
So, is anyone watching Mike Gundy''s mullet on the coaches film room channel? Matt Luke has a good personality. I hope he makes it at Ole Miss.
Your line is off my dudes
Gotta get rid of that.
With how much people have bitched this year about the ESPN app, I'm really glad I use Vue.
Payne is a big strong man
watchespn's code was written buy university of iowa graduates.
stupid joke. quit.
AND NOT A SINGLE BLOCK WAS GIVEN THAT PLAY
Their jaws are just sore
That tackle was so bad that Baker Mayfield was knocked over 
Bad line
Yeah between it being trivia night and Sante Fe, New Mexico I ain't surprised either
Lol why Les Mis music? 
Switched to cover 2 on the right side that was a perfect sit by the receiver
This one is for all the marbles
Memes die in days. People tryed to force it 
Gddayummm
Tua Tagovailoa called Jake Fromm one of his best friends. Aww that's hella sweet
wowowowowowowow
I get NBCSN and the Olympic channel.
You...you want the commentator to shut up?
Holy shit!
That doesn''t look like third and 20
WHAAAA
Great run.
NICE RUN
Most of the country my ass
whaaaaa
Forgot to move the yellow line.
Unexpecting
Wowwww
Really unexpecting that sack
I really like the Mercedes-Benz stadium, so nice looking. 
Whoaaaa
I think I''m the only person who''s never had a problem with that app
Damn what a run
Wow
Fuck Chubb.Michel for Prez 2020
You aren't missing anything im sure
It's on ESPN News
what a fucking run!
HOLY SHIT MICHEL 
Haha that dude can run
How do you let that happen
God Michel is so awesome
What a CALL
SONY MICHEL!!!
They play Phantom of the Opera as well
What a run!
WTF
LES MIS
WOAH. YEAH BUDDY
We need to get our shit together 
God damn wow
Well not anymore.  Lol.  
I just love that Bama plays Look Down from Les Mis for every sack
Michel is ridiculously fast.
THAT'S how the fuck you play defense, let's go!
Sony!!!!!!!!!
Monster run.
WHAT
Holy shit, that was a great run.Damn, Son-y.
Why can no one tackle this man?
You''re a hero
Sexy run
Let's go!!!!
Wims cmon man
lmao
SONY HAVE MY BABIES
What an answer!
ESPN has a few options for free
[deleted]
Michel running himself into the first round these last 2 games. 
You gotta be shitting me D 
wow
Is Michel a god?
Michel is a madman
Wow... gave up on the play
And that is why Georgia should run the football a lot.
I haven't gotten more than 10 seconds in a row.  It's unbelievable 
Turnover novelty item. Gotta have something to inspire your players to play well, right?
i see that both teams are taking turns not blocking every other play   bold strategy 
Piss
I'M SORRY WAT
Damn Sony good shit staying in bounds there
Michel is such a beast. 
fuckin nice
SONY. MOTHER. FUCKING. MICHEL!
Nice run!
Great game. I used to love putting in Reggie Bush as QB and wrecking shit. 
Well holy shit
GOD DAMN
What a run! NICE
r/cfbstreams
"What a stupid call"........"What a brilliant call"HOLY SHIT.
That's what we do
FEED SONY
That run wtf
Bama gave up a 3rd and 20? Has hell freezeth over?
/r/cfbstreams ?
how did that work 
Hell yeah bby
Ooppps, Bama missed 
That run sets up a good opportunity for 3 more passes.
Because t wasn't. 
That's what I was saying
Balance 99
Maybe they should do that more?
Just saved that drive holy shit
r/unexpectedJeanValjean
What a clutch run! Go Michel 
Michel looking great so far. That run was insane.
THE BALANCE
"Somebody messed up unexpecting the blitz," bro do you even English?
Defensive players get it for a turnover. We started it like 3 or 4 years ago
/r/cfbstreams
Michel doesn't give a fuck
Sony>Microsoft
Didn't see that happening
"Sony Michel ~~Rose Bowl~~ Hero"FTFY, Fowler
If you want to insult someone, call them someone's little brother. It made me so damn angry when people would call me, "Kyles little brother."
Pretty good. Stressful day at work, but the work day is over. Thanks for asking.
Bama basically has 1/2 an NFL defense
Oh shit 3rd and bama
How the hell did he stay in bounds?
SONY THE GOD
Yup, Nauta shifted right to block air.
Michel poppin off! let the boy eat !!
Honestly I am the only one qualified to have that belt seeing as I have won a WWE match.
Michel has looked better than Chubb for a while
What a fucking run
Shades of Ezekiel Elliott on that play.
"Unexpecting"-Kirk Herbstreit
awesome run
"It's cool, somebody else will get him."
That''s a BIG 30 yards!!!
SONYYYY!!!!
Good tight rope
let's go baby, woot woot, nice fucking run Sony
It''s stupid how much I love a man I''ll never meet for playing a game. 
Georgia should have blocked that guy.
So much for the vaunted Bama run defense
michele is a beast wow
The line on the telecast was wrong 
Someone said something about 7 day free trial on youtube
Holy shit that was clutch.
Sony so smooth.
THE YELLOW LINE WAS LYING BUT IT DIDNT MATTER
Watching this on WatchESPN, it's so unusual to watch without announcers.
Michel the human cheat code. 
/r/cfbstreams
Can't believe he got the edge on that. That's crazy SPEED
They look like they''re doing awful and then all the sudden he''s gone
SONY MICHEL!!!!!
THAT is why teams run on third and long
What if you mention paddling?
That Elite 11 with them was really cool.
Sony Michel will no longer be underrated after tonight
Georgia should do nothing but run for the rest of the game 
Who knew the running game would ever work for Georgia? When did they discover this?
Don't turn your back against Bama
sony michel is like a playstation character 
I bet he stepped out early 
wow what a fucking loser
Wew lads
WHAT THE FUCK YOU GUYS HAD HIM
I get goosebumps everytime the band plays awesome songs 
Nobody will see this but fuck the Celtics
Wow that was awful tackling
I was saying WTF??? WHY ARE YOU PUTTING IN A RUNNING PLAY?
Lol
"Why the hell would they ru.. oh nvm"
Go dawgs
Review that shit
WatchESPN's infrastructure is garbage, all they care about are mobile users streaming at 480p.
/r/cfbstreams
s'allgood
hot dam 
They''ll never expect a run on third and 20
That was amazing 
Sony!!! Fucking love you
Running on 3rd and 20?! What a stupid fuc...oh, ok...
That yellow line was so wrong lmao. Doesn't matter, Sony Michel gets the first down. A walkman down the sidelines
Every time i hear his name i can only think of the movie Dodgeball.“ME-SHELL” 
What a stud. Broken play becomes a 30 yard run. 
Uh oh Bama UGA's O is opening up
Sony Michel: /r/nonononoyes
HOLY CRAP
yeah
Running the ball on 3rd and 20. Only georgia
#SONY!
Sony, you DAMN good DAWG you!
sAqUoN iS tHe BeSt rUNinG bAcK iN cFb
Nice one Michel!!!!
I'm deleting my account tomorrow and getting off reddit permanently so I just wanted to say it's been an honor shitposting with all of you.Best online community I've been a part of.  Edit: Privacy issues for the account deletion and personal reasons for leaving permanently. It's gotten to be a site that I check 15-20 times a day and I don't think it's healthy for me to do that.
ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME IT'S NOT THAT HARD
Huh. Well damn.
Herbie seems to be fumbling some words tonight...
what the fuck
When UGA gets a first down I think "yes"When Bama gets a first down I think "no"
THE ESPN STREAM IS PISSING ME OFF
Bama's band playing Les Mis and Phantom is so sick
That's the definition of pathetic
Do u no da wae
GO SONY GO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Sony is Haitian Jesus
Averett is a JET. That was surreal. 
With so many people in this thread, I would like to remind everyone that Craig James killed five hookers.  Never forget.
Oh my word.
29 on bama should be ashamed. terrible effort.
Looks like you're on to something there. Hell of a run there 
Because it doesn't matter.
holy shit what a run
This has been pretty damned evenly-matched so far.  No real momentum one way or the other.
How can you be one of the biggest sports entertainment companies in the world and not set up a decent stream?
Doesn't he call the other Grand Slams too?
Well that pick was very Matt Ryanesque 
How the fuck do you let a 20+ yard run happen on 3rd down
He's in!
Who?
Damn Sony....you are good.
Boooo he stayed in
I wished we have Oklahoma today :(
He good
Fantastic body control 
wat....
I will show dem de wae
DUUUUUUUUVAAAAAAAAAAAL
I'm a Microsoft guy, but even I'm willing to say that Sony's really damn good.
Nope he good
SONY MICHEL CHRIST 
The WatchESPN stream is terrible.  It's like seeing a clipshow of uninteresting crap.
Why did he phrase that like Alabama isn't challenging?
Because Bama's band director is lazy and hasn't updated the stand book since 2012 /s
Michel is a bad, bad man.
*whistle blows*...#94: ALRIGHT LET''S DO THIS!!!!”https://i.imgflip.com/22cp78.jpg
Does anyone know how long the halftime is tonight?
Pure SEC. Huge D and running it on 3rd and 20 no question.
LOOK DOWN
Get that man a tightrope
Honestly thought he was out, but damn... Go Dawgs 
Sony! You beautiful beautiful boy!
"Why are we running on 3rd and 20?!?!?!?!" ...*oh*
Can''t we just hope that both teams have a good time?
Impressive run, damn
Inbounds all the way...
Michel, my (cow) bell (back). Holy shit you run the ball so well, Michel my bell.
Oh god let's review every play
That balance and control is incredible
He fast
I never agreed with the guy to be fair. I was just responding about SC
Sony RunMan ™ 
Is there not a no commentary game channel?
Get fucked bama
Why wasn't it further back??
Wow escaped like 6 people
oh my god and he was in bounds
they just stopped and watched him
Holy shit how
Holy shit. What a run. 
Are you saying that a good running team should be running more? I'm shock
That is great footwork
Gotdayum. That was amazing.
Good running lights my fire
It's super common for marching bands at all levels.
I think someone plays it on defensive 3rd downs, too.  Agreed that it's very cool.
what a run!!!
He good baby
I gotchu fam
Holy shit
Ballsy call on 3rd and long, love it!
Impressive ability to stay inbounds
just, fuck.
This B1G crew is doing a pretty solid job so far.
I love you Sony Michel
That "fuck you" 3rd and 20 run play. Damn
great missed 20 yard conversion cause of buffering
A Nick Saban coached defense just doesn''t give up a 26 yard run on a draw on 3rd and 20. 
BOOM BOOM BOOM 
definitely in bounds
Well Im making some phone calls soon I think.Thanks!
“Rose Bowl hero” is not a bad title
Holy damn that was nice
MICHEL > CHUBB
Man i don''t like the way this game is going 
Fuck
Said the wrong name 2-3 times as well
Why? 
You can''t teach that, you either have it or you don''t 
That was a damn good run! Good to see Georgia''s here to PLAY
That play is called "The White Buffalo Run."
Regardless of whether he stepped out of bounds, that was a hell of a run. As I type this, they showed a replay that makes it look like he didn't.
Got them twinkle toes
Who
Sony, marry me?
Nice tightrope walking there. 
Jesus do we really need a review right now
Woooo
Wow, that body control is unreal.Nick Chubb, but Sony hardd.
that freaking body control to stay in...wow
These sideline sorority chicks needa chill
Damn, French tight-walk shit
Dem feet
That''s nice. Hope dinner is good.
For others maybe 
Watching Michel and Chubb run is highkey giving me PTSD
YEET GO DAWGS 
TIP TOES MICHEL!!!!
Dancin on that sideline!
Nope
Www.ESPN.com/watch
That run was insane
Well damn
just what we needed, let's cap off that beautiful run with a touchdown
SONY!!!!!!
in, in, in, in, aaaaand innow cut the commercial short and let's go back to the fuckin' game
Come on refs. This is just to get more commercials in.
Balance of a gymnast, that one
Sony trying to go first round based off these previous 2 games
Clear holding lulz
fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
FUCK YEA SONY! GO DAWGS! WHAT A TIP-TOE MASTERPIECE! 
holy fuck he stayed in
Are you for real?
Sony can fuck my bitch
He''s inbounds.
I miss muscle ref. 
I can''t find this. Which ESPN?   The ocho?
The flair bet was that bad, huh?
That was impressive
Lmao I was fuckin pissed about the hand off 
That was an impressive run.
Wow what a run.
Nice run Dogs.  Now throw it 9 times in a row again
Replay shows him clearly in bounds. Replay official is a fucking turd. 
MICHELLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL
Sony was a prima ballerina in another life.
SONY BEST SEX BOX CONFIRMED
Fuck it's the iPhone commercial
Sony Michel: Balance 99
This replay shouldn't take that long, why are we going to commercial?! 
iPhone X commercial, take a shot. Take five shots at the Bud Light commercial
I love the replay official's voice. I don't know why, he's just pleasant to listen to.
What a run!!How many backs in CFB could have made that run?? 
GO DAWGS!!!!!!
The fuck outta here 
Yeah but I just checked their cars, and Hector's gonna be running 3 Honda Civics with Spoon Engines, and on top of that, he came by to the store today and picked up 3 T-66 Turbos, with NOS and a MOTEC system exhaust
I ain't even mad. That was damn impressive to stay inbounds
Sony Michel is fucking amazing
Clearly in bounds let's take 4 minutes to review it anyway
Fuck yee he's good
This is a thing? Lol
That happened against Auburn as well, on the same side of the field. sp00ky
I DONT HAVE ACCESS TO A TV BUT I SEE PEOPLE GETTING EXCITED HERE SO IM JUST GOING TO START CHEERING.
An Alabama defense giving up a 3rd and 20 on a run makes me irationally happy 
Great Run, someone needs their ass chewed for letting him break contain. 
We do too. Just saying. 
Probably like 45 minutes 
Fuck ESPN. This stream is gonna turn me into a killer
Now Bama knows how we felt lol
Easiest stop in the world and you somehow let an RB get the first on 3rd and 20. Step the fuck up
I'm just here to have fun
Wow I can't believe he converted that 
That has killed Alabama many times. Just playing some soft shit on 3rd down. Expecting the next guy to make the play.
Georgia can't run on Bama? My ass.
tip toeing in my jordans
Knew what the playcall was going to be, but did not expect the outcome. I love you college football. 
That was an incredible run
Excellent run and awareness to stay inbounds.
I feel like I''m watching Ingram and Kamara.
WatchESPN performance at an all time low.  It''s unbelievable.
what
Flip to ESPN
Holy shit he stayed in bounds! Incredible balance
That's an NFL run
Thx bby
1.2/10
Get your ass to a bar
Michel is such a playmaker. 3rd & 20 conversion on the ground. 
3rd and 20? Really?
I tell you what man that Sony Michel kid is pretty dang good
And just when I think Cheney was making a stupid play call
Lit
That's actually a genius idea, just took me 30 seconds to sign up.Now I get to enjoy this 0-0 rollercoaster of a game in glorious youtube fashion
MY GOD THAT'S LES MI^^LE S MUSIC
Why?
I cannot believe he stayed in that whole way. Talk about control
And that is why the hashes don''t touch the sidelines, boys. 
Michel! great run!
The line did look short didn't it?  That or he's so damn fast he just covered it really quickly haha.
Sony even surprises me with his acceleration and I watch him every week
[deleted]
Replay reviews should only be able to be challenged by the coaches. They completely ruin the pace of the game. 
That has to be one of the best runs of the year
Run the dang ball Chaney
No I don''t want to meet you anywhere
Great awareness and footwork. Dancing on wire.
Lol they're reviewing just to review it.
First time this season watching the coaches chat thing. Really like it. 
Damn stayed in the whole time!
WHAT A RUN
Fuck Bama
To be fair Riley is the younger Ridley brother....
THEY TURNED DOWN THE GAME VOLUME FOR TRIVIA NIGHT FUCK ME SIDEWAYS
Ginger black man is the ugliest person in the history of advertising 
No we like it here 
CJK5H
Apple why do you have to make such shitty commercials. 
Let's go!!! Michel is a beast!!
Get a free YouTube tv trial the stream is good.
Wow Ga is like watching alabama with a qb! 
What a fucking play by Michel 
Sony is the man 
The RB class going to the draft this year is stupid good. 
Yeah, just tap him with one hand and assume he goes out if bounds, that's fine
How do you not finish on that
What did I say that was incorrect? The kicker was the only white person on the field, and he is the only one to fuck up as bad as missing the kick. Calling me a *bigoted fuck* for stating 2 facts is laughable and quite hypocritical.
Sony that was wicked 
"the play is under review because the network needs to show some more commercials"
Dammit my stream off by at least a minute but I still want to see you guys shitpost.
I'd meet her in the lounge
/r/HailCorporate 
Only a million other faces, Apple?
I love you 
You missed an n bro.
Is this the same Jake Fromm from the Warner Robins, GA team that played in the 2011 Little League World Series?^/s
This "Lauren" girl from the iPhone commercial is a cutie.
Freckled dude in the iPhone commercial makes me cringe 
Booooo!!!We want a 50,000 comment thread!
Nope. Please keep this going.
I'm gonna miss him :'(
What a run?!? 
This is just proving literally nothing can stop Michel.Literally nothing...
Have my babies, Sony. 
Fuck this commercial.
Good decision to go Oklahoma defense on that play
I read the comments then see what happens two plays later. Thanks to ESPN stream that is slower than old people screwing.
$$$$$$$$$$$
I was cussing at Cheney as soon as he handed the ball off. Now I'm praising his fat ass.
You forgot to put "stream" in quotes
That Sony is hell don't he
Niners, please draft Sony Michel. Thank you.
Amazing effort keeping inbounds
DUMB AS HELL TO REVIEW THATI BET TV CALLED FOR IT FOR MORE COMMERCIALS 
Sony what a run boi 
Mah Gawd Sony! My living room narrating each step: "Nope. Nope. Nope, nope, nope, nope nope nope! 
I hope animojis die a fast fucking death
Michel chews up yards like it''s nothing 
In all the way. What a play!
Incredible balance
You'll be back. They always come back.
Lol 
michel would be a sonuvabitch on the balance beam or a slack line
He got it. That's my lit buddy!
Ya, cause he's a fucking cheat code
Why are you leaving if I may ask
I think the yellow line was in the wrong place
Ballsy? That was the definition of a safe call.
They listened to /r/cfb!
Seconded
wHy WoUlD yOu EvEr rUn tHe BaLl oN 3rD aNd LoNg 
The scary Apple commercial returns! D:
The georgia dome rubbin off on him.
Very impressive balance down the sideline from Michel!
It's a first down
ITS SO JPEGGY 
Why wasn't what further back?
ANYONE USING THE SHITTY ESPN APP JUST GET THE FREE TRIAL FOR YOUTUBE TV AND WATCH IT THERE
Do you want to meet me at the lounge?
Let's go Sony!!!
I think a Ute is an old old wooden ship.
Link?
Because he didn't step out there?
God I hate Apple commercials. 
Apple trying to hide just how creepy the commercial is with that catchy song
Jeez Bama can't get out of its own way. Missed wide open TD, false start on FG, and giving up a third and 20 run.
Fucking hate that ad
Fuck apple
The threads get too unwieldy otherwise 
Blaze, laser, blazer, of course my right hand man Michel,
UGA picked up a first down on 3rd and 20 on a run play against Bama's D.  Let's get weird!
We fucking deserve to be at this game!!! 
this defensive series is some Saban headset-breaking material if I've ever seen it 
Was that just me or did Fitzpatrick give up on that play?
Literally all the peoples
How the fuck did he stay in bounds? 
I don't care how hip* commercial are Apple, still don't care about talking emojis. 
ESPN needs to put the same manpower into improving their WatchESPN stream as they do covering Lavar Ball
damn what a run and what a way too stay in bounds also!
Guys, ESPN is capable of having cameras down the sideline. Why is this impossible for the majority of the NFL broadcasts on other networks?
I hate you
I didn't spit out my drink, but I did chuckle.
Netflix and chill 
Those iPhone emojis are Goddamn horrifying.
That's one hell of a play for Georgia 
More karma
Apple needs to die in a fire
And the pointless reviews start. Got to fit all those commercials in somehow. 
DO YOU WANT TO MEET ME IN THE LOUNGE
You don't expect something like that to happen from Alabama.
This is gonna be a really good game 
What if we are resistant to change?
more like the one time the "safe call" every coach makes and pisses off their fans got the first.
y tho?
Sony stock up 3% in the Asian markets on news of that run
Serious question - could you not just print off a picture of someone and get in their phone? 
Good game so far
Yo you wanna meet me in the lounge?
Yawp
They're being coached by our man
Why are you leaving us
Riley>Calvin 
I see this on here a lot, is it true, a meme, or both?
That's some B12 defense sneaking into an SEC game.
OMG, I don't know what this stream is, witchcraft maybe, but it's just sounds of the game. Zero commentary, it's amazing. Please give me this 24/7.
We are gonna need speed from our RB's. wouldn't surprise me if Sony and Swift have a better game than Chubb. Bama's D closes quick
major hold on 99... but it happens. michel is a beast.
Clearly in bounds but officials are like "FUCK IT...WERE GONNA REVIEW IT!"
not even close to stepping out tho
i want a sony for christmas
I think this Michel guy might be pretty decent at football.
Yeah man that was silly. I'd flag that shit all day everyday 
Try their 1000 other ways to view the game. I'm using their All 22 cam and don't have many problems (yet).
Fuck unnecessary reviews slowing down momentum
I've always liked Michel more than Chubb, he is so freaking good.
The 3rd quarter will pick up tomorrow 
Do you wanna meet me at the lounge?

Third quarter kicks off tomorrow night at 7est.
Nothing more demoralizing than when the offense is conceding their 3rd and long by playing it safe with a draw and you give up 3rd and 20.
Zucc me
ITS MOVING TOO FAST TO READ
I can't believe he stayed in
Does the officiating crew just cherry pick which plays they''d like to review? 
Since this thread is moving so fast, no one will know that I really love you guys :)

Ruling on the field is confirmed on that angle
No one gives a shit about your new emojis Apple
Lightning strikes!
Don't tell me what to do.
Oh cool...commercials during reviews. Sweet 
I,  for one, would prefer to just crash Reddit.
Speed kills.
Freckles there needs some dental work. 
why is it by quarter?
How is your windows phone
Do people really buy new iphones just for stupid features like those emojis.
<3 u too bby. pls let the offseason be quick and fun.
Thought that's what it was. Thanks have an update while I wish for a sad Saban picture later
That fucking iPhone commercial with the deep voice emojis singing at the screen just gave me schizophrenia
Hand off to the rb on 3rd and 20 for the first. Holy shit
Dang, what a run.
The homers stream is the best stream lmfao 
Make sure every question you yell out Turn the game back up! as your answer
Plebbit. You obviously haven't been to /r9k/
I don't want to meet any of you guys anywhere.
Do ya wanna meet me in da club?
Too drunk
ESPN doesn't do much at the French Open. I'm not sure he even goes anymore. He does do Wimbledon. 
I''m pretty tired of this iPhone commercial. 
https://i.imgur.com/8UFOpxg.jpg
what a run michel... Talent on so many levels
Oh good I needed to see the iPhone X commercial 39000 more times.As long as subway doesn't run their new commercial, I'm happy. 
That''s because he didn''t. 
The human race has evolved to the point where we're amused by a talking piece of shit emoji in a commercial...
could bama beat the browns?
I watched Daddy Day Camp last night and I feel like I lost brain cells 
Top notch job by the refs on the tightrope walk.That said, I hate the 2(=)18 logo they have on their stripes.
it kills us year after year. 3rd and long and we just sit back and let someone run 20+ yards for a first down and more. I don't understand it.
What else would I be doing?
never thought id see a shit emoji on tv
He's got a career in the circus after he's done with football with that kind of balance and body control
E$PN
They saw y''all lining up quickly and couldn''t allow that to happen
I would just like to invite ESPN to *burn in hell* for being entirely unable to make a stream that works.
What is this espanol 
Agreed!
YAH
Gotta get them commercial dollars rolling in!
lol
I'm on ESPN :P
I am so sick of these long ass Apple commercials.
What year is Sony? Because I know Chubb has been hyped for a while but this kid is balling recently
Dude doesn't believe in the benefit of exercise because he thinks the body has a finite amount of energy in ones lifetime. 
yeah, we are already at 10,000 comments; thread would get too big fast

I have an iPhone X and it's amazing
More commercials 
?
Reddit struggles if a single thread has too many comments (or at least it has in the past)
Wtf
Commercial break, GA momentum stopper 
The line of scrimmage?  It was 20 yards back, but the yellow line was wrong. 
The chatting emojies are so gimmicky, Jobs is turning in his grave.
BOOOOOOOOO...Ok, sounds good. <3
Club bby
You mean to show more commercials
Worst commercial ever...
Dontcha want to meet me in the club?
I went to a pirated stream because of it
Yeah, but nobody cares about you guys
If a run on 3rd and 20 against Bama wouldn't have worked, imagine the armchair coaches here..
Saban searching how to beat dark link
I dont think so.  That was big play to extend the drive and it was reasonably close.
Gotta get the commercials in 
God, I hate this iPhone commercial.
This app update that replaced “New” with “Live” has rendered the app useless in threads like this. You know... the only kind of threads people sort by New in. 
Apple has lost everything it ever had the second Steve Jobs died....From innovation to dancing unicorns...ugh
That first chick? Fuck yeah
Ok
All plays are reviewed.
39* and yeah that block was shit and he sort of gave up on the play 
I've been more impressed by Michel than Chubb from what I've seen from UGA this year (the Rose Bowl and this game).
We are all immigrants on this blessed day
I'll live, but thanks.
Not gonna lie, I definitely thought he stepped out. How the hell did he keep his balance like that??
We haven't had a commercial in 3 minutes?! We need to review that last play!
UGA needs to keep feeding Michel. dude is feasting right now.
Field goals! Field goals! Field Goals![Specifically 2 per team, per quarter, with no other scoring]
Nearly perfect calling by GA offensive coordinator so far. Love the aggressive pass against Alabama to set up the run, instead of the opposite.
That was kinda necessary though
3D modeling 
Fuck that animoji ad
Goddammit I am convinced they review some of these just to shove more commercials down our throats. 
huh?
Gotta review it to make sure there's enough commercials. 
Best damn mods in the land.
He can''t prove that he didn''t.
Eh. Bama's first drive was pretty good. Looked like they could score. Hurts then missed an unguarded receiver for a touchdown then they got a penalty to moss the fg. And thats just the first drive. It probably wont be the same as that game
Sony is gonna soften them up in the 1st half and Chubb is gonna run them into the ground in the 2nd.
Dear Alabama, I am rooting against you this evening.
Almost 10,000 for the quarter 
Just announced more people are watching the Lebatard cast on ESPN3 than the actual game.Proud of you guys
Haha, need a new bar, mate. 
and we're over 10k comments1 quarter thread down, 3 to go!

Im scared of Georgia. We have them next year
There's a lot of things our government wastes money on, why focus on one that a lot of people enjoy and serves both PR for the military, and as a good morale booster?
"Do you wanna meet me in the lounge?Do you wanna meet in the club?Do you wanna meet me downtown?"When did Apple start lurking in /r/creepypms to make their ads?

I'm glad this game got B1G refs. Every conference has issues, but I mostly really like our refs.
Have the Italians ever seen a black dude before? 
https://mobile.twitter.com/sportingnews/status/950540110403121152
You haven't seen the animated emojis yet
To think, I find myself looking for an illegal stream because my WatchESPN stream is so bad.
It's sad that Apple's main marketing pitch is that dumb emoji gimmick
Bama deserves to lose after giving that up.
Are there any fans from outside North America here? If so how did you get into American football 
:'( that was beautiful though
Anybody else freaked out by the whole FaceID shit?
Wtf is a ute
That was a reasonable review call to me.
I Hope we get to see the Honda Accord trophy commercial again
Why the duck is the review taking so long? Assholes.  
For as much shit as the other conferences and the nfl refs get I actually do kinda like the BIG refs
that kid fucking sucks at drawing
I love the tenacity of Kirby to just fuckin'' send it with a run on 3rd and long. 
It''s #innovation.
The ir dots look for matching depth so a simple picture wouldn''t work

If Georgia wins, how heartbroken will Bama fans feel after losing the national championship two years in a row?
/r/AndroidMasterRace
We could still do that.
We should just eliminate replay. Let the refs call the game. Too much interference with flow
Anytime a big game is on that app so many people tune in it blows up their servers.  Happens every single time.  The only time I can ever use it is for some game that's not in my coverage area that 12 other people might be watching.
yes
Fuck the iPhone X, my Note 8 is explosive yo
Look ma, I drew some circles!!!
I''d pay for this.
Someone once told me the original video was staged, and I got irrationally mad at them and refused to accept it. 
What is a computer?
Yeah right that's Apple's MO
Hall yeah!
Maybe a little bit of both lol
Ah sorry about that. Try to find an alternate stream. The ESPN stream is really horrible and it'll just buffer every few minutes or even every few seconds. 
iPhone X (10): it can recognize black people
Ya
Everybody gets one... 
I'm really digging this ref. Whenever he explains a play, its not as condescending and annoyed as most pro refs are, it's like a happy uncle patiently explaining what's happening.Also they've been pretty good on their calls thus far.
Ok he''s in, let''s play football- wait we need to see the iPhone X for the 1200th time.
Anyone watching the coach's film room? Gundys mullet is glorious as per usual 
It's pretty standard to review a run like that actually. He was so close to out of bounds. Especially a game this important.
Takes 10 seconds to look at the replay and see when he is out. Should be 20 seconds top for him to view it then make the call on the field.Naturally the review results in a 2 minute commercial break.
Michel looking like LeVeon Bell with that hopping behind the line and the explosive speed to the edge. 
I mean, that took 1 watch to confirm what we knew. They didn''t need to stop the game for that. 
I hate apple but iMessage is just too good 
I don''t understand that northwestern mutual commercial
Just letting them Dawgs take a break before we score 7 points. I'm cool with it. 
SEC Championship 2:SEleCtric boogaloo

These fkn bama fans are insufferable. You'd think they are on the team with how smug they are. God please beat them. Your coach has a few years left then it's back to schula days. Kirby has 10+ years to go. Already taking your recruits
Thx mods <3
wow i was almost sure he was out of bounds, insane body control
I'm pretty tired of the Apple marketing wank in general.
All season in CFB. Soon as anyone gets momentum stop it for something stupid
When the singer in the iPhone says, "You are my best friend, and we've got some things to do," does she think she's being sneaky when it comes to talking about the dance with no pants?
Reviewing just so they can go to commercial 
If it were legal Mike Leach would have put Craig James and his son in the Boo Box. 
Nah they had the first down marker goofed. I thought I was drunk too but Sony ran greater than the line to gain
Too many comments screws with servers site wide. Quarters are good break points instead of halves when there are this many comments. 
ESPN YOU ARE PAYING $5.64 BILLION DOLLARS FOR THE RIGHTS TO THE NEW YEARS SIX AND COLLEGE FOOTBALL PLAYOFFSFIX YOUR MOTHERFUCKING STREAMING SERVERS/SERVICE.
What is the T-Rex in Basketball court and how is that useful ever?
I like how Apple is pretending I couldn't unlock my Moto Droid 4 with my face in fucking 2012.
Do you think ESPN makes the stream worse then broadcast on purpose? Maybe to cast doubt in the minds of Cord cutters?
Michel>Chubb
Not all of us
He's from Toms River, NJ. 
And google too.  Shit, especially google 
What does that ad even mean
Great no 30 second commercial break.
Nothing but gold flowing out of Cutcliffe's mouth on this coaches film room. His insights are great and even the other coaches go completely quiet and turn to him when he starts speaking
Great title for a guy from a SEC team.

Why are all the chicks in the iPhone commercials ugly?
A talking one at that!

Yeah the roof is on fire
Game threads become unstable after 10k comments or so.
Can we add a delay on mobile!? I am 1k comments behind
By quarter is overkill
That guy''s draft stock just went through the roof on that. Unbelievable concentration and athleticism 
I switched over to sky cam and it''s wayyy better. Just don''t tell anyone
Fuck em. 
Breathe. 
Wtf don''t make me feel things, commercials
EXCUSE ME, I believe they're called Animojis!
Is it really though? Haven't people been complaining all year?
Gotta get them commercials in. 
Lmao why the niners tho. As a niner fan I would gladly take him in day 2 if he has a good combine.
That's cool ESPN, I didn't want to watch the game. You should continue having the absolute worst fucking streaming service.
That was a really impressive run on a huge down. Outstanding
Idk I hope we find out
One thing we can agree on tonight.
TBH, that was a great run by Sony.
I'm pretty sure that 3rd and 20 was wrong. 
I'd rather lose to Kirby more than any other coach. 
That commercial is full cringe too.
We''re well past that point. But that''s what makes it fun!

Tell me about it. We get them every year...
Nvm, DONT watch the homers telecast.

This thread is already at 10k+ comments. Anything past 15k becomes basically unusable, so much easier to call it early than late.
Watch the film room lol cameras on both coaches the entire time
ESPN is fucking incompetent and can't make a stream that actually works.
That was an impressive run. Way to stay in. 
Good. Shit was tight 
More commercials. I was starting to OD on football. 
i had to turn off from FireTV and watch on browser.  It was about unwatchable. Browser doing a little better but now no big screen.

We're at the pinnacle. Its all down hill from here.
Athletic ability.
Uhh idk about that
Ah, figured it couldn't be that simple. Thanks.

Try watching the stream from the actual website, it's not having any streaming issues. espn.com/watch
I like Fowler but his attempt to the southern accent with dawgs is an abomination

Thanks Apple, but I don't need a piece of poop to sing suggestively at me.

I think running the ball might be a good idea! You guys should do that more often.Please beat bama
>Bama deserves to lose ~~after giving that up.~~FTFY
Why are they reviewing this? So damn annoying.
Oh look UGA does know they can run the ball
Why not link it lmao

While I'm sick of seeing it, that Apple commercial is at least a decent commercial - it just highlights the features of the new phone and isn't too gimmicky or dumb. Unlike almost every god damn fucking car commercial
Or Green Bay is like the Georgia logo 
The blonde chick in the animoji one is pretty cute.
Well they''re gonna lock it so...
The committee should have..
I think they thought it was enough of a push for him to step out. Mistakes happen and there's still plenty of game left.
It won''t be a wake up call. We have had a lot of shit years with mediocre expectations. Enjoying this while it lasts. 
My point is that there are multiple close plays every game which never get reviewed 
Our D played too damn soft on that... Assumed he'd be pushed out
Fuck those animated emojis wtf manI don't wanna meet them at the club
Is Georgia in field goal range? I can't tell anymore without the line, this is vital information that should be displayed all game for all situations. /s
How's your fake facial recognition 
Only if you're really ugly. Then you seem reputable
Chubbs only runs up the middle and it's stupid
Just an opportunity for them to say hey let's take a review so we can show more commercials since there hasn't been a stop or change in possession. Killing the pace of the game

I'm actually happy. This season puts a death nail into the committee

Film Room on running on 3rd and 20: Georgia can't protect the pass, play it safe and put the ball in your best player's hands. 
Gotta love apple acting like features that Android has had for years are revolutionary tech.

Would you rather your team have Bama's D line or Georgia's running game?

Just wait for the second half where they implant commercials in commercials. 
Why can't we have refs that articulate in the NFL?
Where

Yeah, don't like UGA capitalize off a huge plays momentum.

Fromm looks more like a Freshman tonight than he did against Notre Dame.
Lmao. I fixed it
I like it, keep being aggressive 
Salty as fuck. This is why UGA fans will be the worst if they win. Kick rocks fuckboy. 
I hope so. My love affair with Hurts is hurting.
Gotta have time for commercials
You are nasty 
2018: Where you can watch a split screen of the football game and Mike Gundy's mulletThey need this for every game next season
you can at least still get them from people :)
Yup! 
How in the fifty fuck did he go ripshit for the sideline to get the corner and *not* go out of bounds?  That's fucking incredible.
Alabama pick, Alabama missed FG, big Sony Michel run. Not much else yet.
Fiscally, it is the responsible thing to do.
Georgia''s run game is actually on point tonight.  They''ll be ahead at the half- where it goes from there is a toss-up.
I was counting lines like...that doesn't look like 3rd & 20
Plus, I don't see this as a great security feature. Can someone unlock your phone while you're sleeping?
and four billion high schools
I've always hated the Packers for some unknown reason and now it makes so much sense
Reddit breaks around the 10k comment mark. 
Maybe we should have spring game threads?
This is why adblock exists.
Relatively uneventful first quarter.  If one team goes HAM it might break reddit
*SEC Football: The Game*
Nope, that's what the screen said
Shouldn't Canadians be watching the leafs? Or is that over 
Wait til the second half. Youll see
Just want to wish Dish Network a hearty 'fuck you' for having their identity server 'under maintenance' so I can't log in and watch the game via espn.com.
Dan Le Batard Show stream is fucking fantastic. 
Sounds dumb to me too. Mods are weird
I mean we have a decent in between of bothJust no secondary 
Nah, this shit was happening in our garbage bowl game too.
I am still conflicting but I have decided.Go Dawgs. 
Bamas D is always so good. 
The 2016 World Series Game 7 had 80,000 comments! Let's smash that mark
I''m gonna miss this thread
Right? I miss the days when the announcers would discuss players, teams etc during downtime. Now if there is no action it's just immediate commercial. 
Basically been all defense so far, yo.
Interception by Bama, Bama kickers xD, Punt, Punt, Georgia in FG range
Running is working well. Lets throw it instead
I love how it cut out just when you knew he was breaking out the run but couldnt see how far he was going
Bama *still* can't kick a FG (LOL) but their defense is legit.
$
They deserve it.I mean all that in state talent and their last one was in '80?The hell?
Not at allEver feel like chatting with your friends but also making an ass of yourself in public? Here''s the solution for you. 
We love you too :)
Oh it''ll be a wake up call for a lot of Alabama fans who''ve gotten spoiled ;)
I SECOND THIS. I DID IT AND IT MADE ALL THE DIFFERENCE.CURRENTLY WATCHING THE GAME IN CRISP, 720P WITH LITTLE TO NO LAG, NO HICCUPS, AND NO FREEZES
Glad bama's d got rested during review. /s
Yea, not a good idea to hold the ball more than 3 secs.
Georgia's plan is to lose yards and first and second down to get Michel more yards on 3rd down.
Don''t worry guys it''s probably a run 
NBA ad game on point
Honda manuals feel so nice, too
They are REALLY AGGRESSIVE with the commercials tonight. 
There's Fromm's freshman mistake of the day: not getting rid of that ball.
BrutalSlingTV is working well for me if you have itPlus I have ESPNNews which has the coaches room which is fucking awesome
Decent plays, amazing pick by bama, bama missed a FG after getting a penalty on first attempt.
It has to be when their service is so shitty you need wifi to be able to text. 
The seam route was open twice , not that Fromm had time to see him
You haven't missed anything. UGA threw an INT then Bama missed a FG.
Georgia look meh, Bama stole a pick.  Bama march. Bama miss field goal.  Georgia punt. Bama punt. Georgia march. Here we are.
At least cars have features that are useful. How is making my face into a piece of shit in a text chat useful?
STOP RUNNING IT UP THE MIDDLE. IT'S NOT WORKING.
I would be happy to get that.
WE HAVE 3 MORE QUARTER THREADS AND THE POST GAME PERK UP
i just want the last comment in this thread
Do you think Kirby and saban have little sensors in their jackets for the cameras to track
[is this numically showing that Alabama should win? this is a list of the schools with the highest recruiting talent. check those numbers. ](https://imgur.com/gallery/uwLOT) 
Watch the coaches channel on ESPN news
"Nah, I didn't get an agent. Will skip"
Bama intercepted 1st drive. Jalen Hurts is Blake Bortles. Michel is magic. Everything else is normal Bama UGA stuff
Pretty sure that Goggles is always in range...
The ESPN app is hot garbage, it has been all year.  I'm laughing at how bad it is...the commercials play without hesitation or buffering.  But the game is completely unwatchable.  They can't afford to pay back the ad money to their sponsors for ads that don't air, I suppose.
It''s another SEC barn burner!
Try the command center stream. It's been working fine for me
I was streaming via WatchESPN, so we've seen the same amount of gameplay
Stupid play calling for the first two downs. Georgia playing to get in the board 
S E C D E F E N S EECDEFENSE
Well the sentiment still stands
Damn this coaches room is pretty awesome. I really like hearing Gundy and Cutcliffe talk about the game
Game threads break around 10k comments, yes.
no u
Scoreless 1st
Those Accords look like more angular Chevys
Looks like we're rioting boys
It's really the only major conference that I don't hear bad things about as far as the referees go. 
goodbye thread
The last night of the ND and UGA bromance. 
Wooo
My watchESPN has been flawless on Skycam so far
That's a bad issue but seeing that fucking singing emoji just irriatea me more. Why don't we make our OS more efficient? FUCK THAT LETS MAKE A DIGITAL UNICORN SING A CRAPPY SONG 
Bye thread!
should have thrown it there, they where expecting a conserative  run call there
To the second quarter thread! Dilly Dilly!
Not all heroes wear capes
Our governor, on the radio, to a fluff question, she just said the hardest thing about the job is the executions.Damn. 
No
Fuck auburn 
Your lips to Gods ears
The plan:Clemson sneaks into UGA locker at half. Uses sleeping gas.Suits up and plays us instead.
More commercials!
Go Dawgs. 
I miss the Rose Bowl. 
I wouldnt hate them so much if they werent shown LITERALLY every break
ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED!?!
COMMERICALS!
This reminds me of the 2016 MIchigan OSU game. Low scoring early on but will get exciting 
Really impressive. Glad I got to see it once
We''re not doing much on 1st and 2nd downs... Frustrating!
You get a panasonic instead
Also, ESPN 2
$900 Billion dollar companies idea of innovation is, dancing emojis.
Next thread!
Whooo 
Agreed. Fuck bama. 
This is not an advisable course of action
Thanks for all the work y'all do.
Phrasing
It's now been 4 years since the last time a B1G team scored in the Playoffs
S-E-C
Does anyone else think Jalen Hurts looks like Lil Pump if Lil Pump didn''t do drugs
It's better than any recent Nissan commercial, at least.
I love that stadium so much
Keep feeding that ball to michel as long as the o-line keeps breaking through.
Broadcasters have gotten so many names wrong.
The main stream sucks. But try the hometown radio feed. Same broadcast, less people streaming it, plus hometown radio broadcasters instead of ESPN announcers!Other option I like is the sky cam or the sounds of the game stream. Sounds of the game is great cuz it''s the same video feed of the main stream, but all you hear is the crowd, the bands, and the PA announcer!
ONWARDS INTO THE UNKNOWN 
You seem nice.
Really did not expect a scoreless first quarter.
They're not practical, they're just another way for millennials to waste their time 
MORE FUCKING COMMERCIALS
If we could block everybody on one play that'd be great
Run, throw, repeat
To be fair, B1G refs are terrible. 
Lane's little black book.
See you in the next quarter you dirty animals
Yes
Wtf more commercial
Bye thread!
Ute bro
F
Good to see the B1G's refs still haven't figured out holding.
they got like 4 commercials in tho
Bruh you're deaf
Georgia's kicker is decent enough he should be able to hit the game winning fg from there
Speak for yourself 
MORE COMMERCIALS 
BYE FIRST QUARTER THREAD
Lol two plays then straight back to commercials.
Fuck me? Happily
Let's address it in the offseason then totally forget about it 
I thought you were saying on the team in total.

I don't know, she seems kinda bitchy and unpleasant
lol "nvm bye going back to college, ill try again next year"
They''re silly but actually fun. 
Last
No this thread is good
I think they have better things to do then to ban some Purdue fan
Fromm throws pic, bama moves down the field makes field goal then penalty removes said field goal and then misses, now Georgia on the move
That's how you go slightly faster.
Isn't there a Senior Bowl thread?
MORE COMMERCIALS PLZ
40k would be low tbh. The wild card playoff games hit 35k this past weekend
THANK YOU MILLER. What is happening.
Don't have children
Defense and a missed FG
I also dont think a official challenge shluld just turn into a media timeout when it couldnt have taken more than 15 seconds to confirm that.
Who the fuck is swift?!?!? 
Struggling reading numbers tonight.
Lol
More commercials everybody
I''ve never been less enthusiastic about a NCG. My salt levels are over 9000! (But it''s been a week and I can laugh now)
It makes me cringe that there are people who are unknowing about apples ripoff
Yay back to commercials!!

Grambling State also uses it.  It belonged to the Packers first.  (oh, and for the record ... FTP).

I didn't realize every painting in a museum has a crowd in front of it 
They lose both Michel and Chubb, so they'll take a bit of a step back as far as the run game goes. 
Unwieldy in the sense that a full half's worth of comments is enough to lag the thread to shit n

Yo a championship game first quarter only took ~40 minutes

Fun fact: the second quarter of the football game is the second of four quarters in a football game
A great defensive quarter for both teams
Hoist the colors?
Hi
I was watching the commercial channel and a college football game broke out.
Mods didn't fumble the handoff this time
I want a battle to a scoreless tie at the end of regulation.
Yes that was football. Time for additional quarters of football. 
Georgia looks really good. 
Found it
We have the beat 10,700. Totally doable.

"We are the addiction network"
I don''t even care if it''s fought in the trenches, at least there have been entertaining plays.
Lovesick is a pretty funny british show thats similar to you're the worst if you like that type of humor. Bright starring Will Smith is pretty awesome as well.
Fuck the SEC
I love you. :) 
It does mean more
link?
Oh my god yes. It''s like sex to the ears hearing another voice that actually knows what a football is.
Ruff ruff muthafuckas, 1st quarter thread was way better tbh
That's a good bulldoggo
lmao "dark web email scan" by ExperianLemme get right on that
Da bomb
.....Commercials
Hug of death
Lol
The main stream sucks. But try the hometown radio feed. Same broadcast, less people streaming it, plus hometown radio broadcasters instead of ESPN announcers!Other option I like is the sky cam or the sounds of the game stream. Sounds of the game is great cuz it''s the same video feed of the main stream, but all you hear is the crowd, the bands, and the PA announcer!
I LIKE TURTLES 
I don't understand why conferences advertise or what it's supposed to accomplish.
Guys, I'm taking Rx ibuprofen and muscle relaxers. Can I still have a drink? This game is really rough without alcohol...
2nd quarter now. Leggo!
Obviously, it''s too you nerd 
isn't Experian the company that got all my personal data stolen and now I have to check my credit monthly?if so fuck em
Those SEC commercials are more hilarious during basketball season.
I really like that stream; I would watch it as a neutral, but I'm enjoying the radio call as a dawg fan
This game will end in a tie and then UCF will be officially crowned as the champs!
IT JUST MEMES MORE
Nice
We've got undecided, undecided, and the advertisements.
Flo is the worst, right?
Dark web is just a buzzword now smh
Put Tua in
So when does the winner play ucf? 
WHERES HARVARD I NEED MORE FACTS
I''m rooting for Bama, but that is a damn good dog right there
*nerves*
I cant reach reddit
I forgot this game was happening. fuck
IT
D A R K W E B S C A N 
Imagine Butch Jones watching the film room with the rest of these coaches. Dude would be confused as shit by some of the things that would come out of their mouth
I swear to god, if I see that Accord trophy commercial again...
Accurate.
Anyone else watching the game on the dark web? 
They have a flashlight 
Is Kevin Sumlin stoned or something?  The guy just comes across like an idiot.  Just let Cutcliffe and Tubs from Ole Miss and the nerd from Northwestern talk.They need Daz back for the coaches' broadcast.
I find that switching to the secondary streams helps. No lag on the Georgia radio stream, as insufferable as it is
#FUCK YEAH!
MODS ARE THE WORST LET'S BREAK THIS THREAD BEFORE THEY CAN LOCK IT
Uga is a good doggo.
I'm just here so I won't get fined.
[deleted]
They just meme more.
SEC with the monopolization of conference ads during the game
It just memes more
They don''t play school in the sec
nice
It
set up mirrors
Well that was an odd call
3-0, here we come!
It's the SEC difference. CBS is leaking.
They have Goggles, so 0%
This could get erotic
hey
Barely!!!
A RUN DOWN THE MIDDLE???
Googles will lead us to victory 
Thank you D!

r/AtlantaHawks is leaking
yeah but we are /r/cfb fans so it's not like we are going anywhere
Why?
nice.
It doesn't even matter how good your internet is. 
Just like I forgot that last second td
7-1 is not a perfect record. 
Let''s get on the board dawgs 
Over under for the game:Total Points scored vs Commercials -6.5I''m going commercials
What you doing there Jim, smh

Why does Vandy never get any love in the SEC commercials?

Oh god I just realized two SEC teams means nothing can counter IT JUST MEANS MORE
GREAT GOGGLED ONE
Fromm needs to keep that
Okay Georgia lets get some points here!
> perfect> 7 - 1Pick one. 
They will after tonight 
GODGLES
Yup.
The Real Ghostbusters. Look it upOr The Super Mario Bros Super Show. Both are high quality entertainment
Too many comments in a single thread kills the servers. Site wide. It''s better for everyone to play it safe than gamble on the number of comments at the end of a half. 
Alabama missed FG? Check.UGA struggling on offense? Check.Alabama dominating line? Check.Occasional big UGA run play? Check.
yeah but no worries they'll scan the "dark web" to make sure you're safe. fear mongering fucks
/r/oldpeoplefacebook 
That dark web scan commercial. Lmao, if only they knew
c'mon Goggles, blast this sum'bitch halfway to Marietta!... unless you're going south, then boot it the other way
#HOTROD
my main man GOGGLES 
It's because you don't have a flair
Already played, this is just for 3rd place
Glasses the kicker is up now
Wish I got ESPN Classic on the TV.  "Sounds of the Game" sounds legit but no fucking way I'm using WatchESPN
miss 
IT JUST MEMES MORE
You can scan it, but it's just shooting in the dark.
IT's time for Big Dick Blankenship
the zodiac killer!!
Anyone else furiously refreshing the other thread? Lol
yep. instead of wtaching on big tv, watching about 9inch browser window
Winner plays UCF?
10K comments in the 1st quarter thread! Wowza
What is Taylor doing with her life?
Miss
This is boring af. Can we see some throws?
SEC is the best really. I miss living in the southeast. Arizona can't compare!!!
I just want to let both teams know that I'm already drunk and I apologize for anything I say from here on out. I love you guys. 
Google would pay billions for that tech, but Experian cracked it.
Oof
I feel a repeat of Bama-LSU 2011 game coming on.
ESPN can you please just bring your cameras to the other side?I would rather just always watch my Dawgs go left to right.
Right you are Kenny 
It would be pretty funny if Alabama didnt score at all.

So. Much. More.
Hot Rod!
Finally got dinner out of the oven (venison pot pie, fucking delish) and remembered there was a little game tonight.  Mondays, man
I FEEL LIKE AMERICA IS CHEERING FOR GEORGIA TONIGHT.
If you're struggling with ESPN3, try watching it directly through your provider e.g. [tv.xfinity.com](https://tv.xfinity.com)
Can someone start a 3rd Quarter post so I can make some mid game bets??
played conserative there, just to get points, smart I guess
It just means MORE. It doesn't mean score. 0-0
Wait, if this is the national championship game, why isn''t UCF playing?
Let's break 20k this quarter 
Hey can that guy masturbate at halftime please.
dude is straight up *flexing* with those shades!
The kicker looks like Post Malone in that picture. 
If you aren't watching the coaches film room you're missing out!
GOGGLES
And drainkeen, don't forget dranking
Ok back to sorting by new

GAWDRIGO
Let's go goggles!!!!!! 
COmmercial time

That''s how you do FGs Bama 
At least one team can make a field goal
They seem very popular with certain southern fanbases. Who knew they liked to invest so much?
I believe that's the one, yeah. Edit: It's Equifax actually. 
SCAN THE DARK WEB!!!1!11!
3-0. An insurmountable lead 
It's almost as if the game hasn't started and its just starting now!
Fuck goggles miss it!
does georgia ever mix their plays up, or is it "we're going to pass 10 times in a row. now we are going to run 10 times in a row."
I can't even get on because Google Fiber's authentication servers are shitting the bed
Bad kicking really sucks. No one wants to see a game decided by that. Edit: fuck, i really would've rather seen it decided by kicking.
Lol the lebatard show cast is so making my night. No way I watch this game otherwise 
More goggles!!!
This is considered "high scoring" for these teams.
 Still think you should've called him Wild Thing. 
FIRST BLOOD
GOGGLES!
GOGGLEZ
Ah yes, 0-0. The score everyone expected 
Somebody did something. Amazing. 
GEORGIA NO IT'S A TRAP, DON'T SCORE FIRST
Having a good place kicker looks pretty neat.
GOGGLES!
Nice 
Baby we got a Hot Rod.
strong kick there wow
Miss animoji just wants to meet Mr animoji in the lounge to give him his eyebrows back.
Wow, you should know more about your data.If you're this ignorant about it, it doesn't even matter.It was Equifax.
Their spokesman looks like Charlie from Always Sunny.
Ayy, O H
GLASSES!
Those BCGs get me every time.

If the game ended right now Georgia would win
 No fair Georgia has a kicker
Oh, WTF IS THIS?!?! You're interrupting my commercials with football again?!? I want my infomercial back!!!
It''s goooooooooooooooooooooooooooooood!
Points!
REC SPECS!
I went to an SEC University and I can tell you that they do, in fact, have many classrooms at UA.
A kicking battle. Our kryptonite.
goggggles
Fowler still throwing shade at the Bama kicker 
What a surprise we run the ball and the offense works. Not a single run in the previous drives
I'd like to claim the 1st Quarter Game Thread Last Comment National Championship for the University of South Florida. GO BULLS!
3 better than nothing, let's go dawgs 
I can get the other streams just not the main stream
Thanks! 
THE BEST KICKY BOI
I had no idea that UGA's kicker is a cartoon character
Honestly this game is going to come down whoever adjusts better at halftime.

Ok. Let's just call the game over now. 
HOW MANY COMMERCIALS
GOGGLES!
I called this drive ended in a field goal
Good job Goggles
Thank god I can watch some more commercials now
Anyone have a good stream? WatchESPN so butt. 
I thought UGAs kicker was supposed to be bad?
This is a big SEC showcase. So of course they are going to fuck it up with dumb shit.
Fuck you Papanastos 
Mother. Fucking. Barn. Burner.
So fucking annoying, fuck Papa nasty he is so bad, literally cannot hit past 35~
I love specs
ESPN through YouTube TV has worked great so far. Usually, they both crap out equally so I'm kinda shocked I'm getting a great stream
The hometown radio stream is decent. 
I feel like I've watched more commercials than game at this point
Goggles.
0-0 OT
FUCKING SUMLIN AT THE COACHES ROUNDTABLE, BUT NO JIMBO?????
WHAT IS THIS SORCERY
Proof Georgia is not a Bama clone. They can kick a FG.
Goggles <3
That Georgia kicker is better than Arguayo
ALL HAIL THE ROD
I had nowhere to post my shitty comments 
That stream going better than the main game one? 
GEORGIA CONFIRMED NATIONAL CHAMPIONS, 3-0
Congrats to randomboltsfan as the last commenter in the previous thread
Can you imagine being a walk-on your first season and making it to the National Championship, in no small part due to your excellent field goals?:') love you Goggles
Georgia's kicker is legit.
We have a winner!
If Georgia wins it will be because of goggles. 
If it comes down to kicking, Georgia has this thing in the bag
Woooooo! Let's go Georgia bros
My favorite kicker for real
Let's go Dawgs 
Four Eyes hits the 3!
But if it's this game...
Rodrigo Blankenship sounds like a randomly-generated rookie in Madden
And time for more commercials after only two plays
This football game is seriously interrupting my commercials
Dear Chevy, die in a fire like GMC
Rodrigo Blankenship sounds like the love interest in an erotic novel
GOGGLES!
I'd give a sensible chuckle to that
but but it just means more didn't you hear? 
Goggles.
FUCK YEAH! GET EM GOGGS!
Finally, points!
Missing our field goal will be the deciding factor in this game. CALLING IT.**fuck.**
Naming my second born son Goggles 
What is this, soccer? We score our points with our hands, not our feet
Why do all college kickers have huge ass shoulder pads and just look so awkward?
Bama gonna lose special teams battle badly. 
Field goals just mean more.
He needs a skull on his glasses like Wild Thing in Major League.
Yes... yes... you must score first against Alabama. 
You done goofed Kirby. You know to never score first on Bama. 
Hey that guy nailed it
Goggles == Points
Glasses is superior to papa johns
SCAN THE DARK WEB WITH YOUR TACTICAL SUNGLASSES
I would so long as Bama is on the losing end
Georgia kicker MVP of the game
Can't wait till the post kickoff commercial break. 
Goggles is money... goggles is life
Points on the board! 8-) Believe in the goggles.
nce
Im sorry what?
Or you know, the lines.
I feel your pain
Hey do you guys like commercials?  Cuz this game has commercials.
I bet the over too. Wishful thinking I guess
Ordering my Rodrigo Blankenship jersey rn. 
We need more players to wear glasses/goggles. 
there goes the hope for a new 0-0 meme
Incoming cringe Chevy ad
Yes, more commercials!!
Good kick you fucking nerd.      
Lightning doesn't strike twice.
No.
Wait.... What do you mean "press coverage"?
Oh so Fowler will jinx the Bama kicker but not the UGA kicker
This will get buried so who cares... Fuck Beyoncé. She garbage. 
move to the ESPN megacast w/audio from r/cfbstreams
Everyone gets a kicker except bama... it's like going to oprah and she does a give away and somehow she's one item short
GOGGLES!
Feels like 30 commercial breaks since we've seen Alabama's offense.
Oh look another commercial
BUBBLES PUT THEM AWAY!
That's why I mute it and get on here. 
Goggles my dude
Must be nice having a place kicker who you like
P O I N T SOINTS
[Hotrod!!!](https://m.imgur.com/gallery/96S6NnP) 
Goggles is money!! 
These commercials are a freaking joke.
The Traverse is just like a Mercedes right?
how much puss does specs get 
This is looking like the Bills/Jags game from yesterday
Is Bobo guest calling these plays?
Nice.
Hey mods just a thought: this thread is more important than the picture/video/gif thread and should be stickied.
legit and legal stream, no espn sub required:http://www.espn.com/watch/player?bucketId=2&id=3265225
Jesus Christ the commercials 
one or two but it'll be like fighting a greased GOT mountain trying to stay awake
Points will be at a premium, smart call. 
Fake actors, that's what's in the inside
SEC CHAMPIONSHIP 2: ELECTRIC BOOGALOO
REC! SPECS!
Is that guy wearing glasses on a football field? Get contacts man that can't be safe
And we got points
There's more commercials than actual game.
Anyone watching the Homers on ESPN2? I think it's cool.
So are the glasses for seeing or looks? And if for seeing why not contacts?
We got the lead!
S.E.Zzzzzz
Should be up right now, at least a touchdown. Definitely if Tua is in.
Points!! Finally!
The one and only*So far
If this game lasts past 12 I will scream and I may punch a wall.
This football is really getting in the way of my commercials 
http://wasatchmediaworks.bigcartel.com/product/college-fanatics
>GOOGLES!FTFY Boilermaker bro!
Lol no?
He's good now.
MORE FUCKING COMMERCIALS
Maybe Alabama's kicker should wear glasses too.
H O T R O D
Guys, I'm fucking bored.
ESPN must be trying to make back all that lost revenue in one night with all these commercials.  
Don't want this football game to get in the way of my commercials! 
Is his middle name actually HotRod?
“We kidnapped your family and put them in this car!”
Good job Squints
Michel is giving me literal nightmares. 
Goggles!
If you''re watching on watchESPN, try one of the hometown radio stations, they have a lot less lag and buffering.
Love glasses kicker
Kickers win championships
Also try it directly through your provider e.g. [tv.xfinity.com](https://tv.xfinity.com)
Film Room is so much better than the regular broadcast.
Go Hotrod. 
9-6 Georgia, calling it
Thank you goggles lol ty Aaron 
Ugh
They're all good doggos
Come back from commercials for one play then commercials. Kickoff then more commercials incoming 
Fuck off chevy
My nips are hard enough to cut a new glass Championship trophy
MY MAN GOGGLES!
I hate car commercials
damn i missed it? did the other team even bother fielding players?
what an athletic geek
I thought all of r/cfb was boycotting this game? Thread seems pretty active.
What game?
Goggles is good
I love how Georgia's kicker looks like Milhouse. *Everything is coming up Milhouse!*
Field goals mean more than touchdowns in the sec. 
3:6 final score confirmed 
THANK YOU BASED GOGGLES!
Thanks Harvard
That's the joke.Think about it. 
HOT ROD

Third down, commercial. Kick, commercial. Kickoff, commercial incoming?
Long defensive battle incoming.
If bama loses by a field goal this will be lolsIn a fucking kill me kind of way.
watchespn's code was written by university of iowa graduates. Try the data center: http://www.espn.com/watch/player?bucketId=2&id=3265225
change flair to Harvard.
Only on plays that are prime numbers on the year's total play count.
How do we get this kicker thing? 
I picked such a good day to get the flu on 
Thank god, that was way too long without commercials.
That was Equifax my bovine friend.
We're Chevy, we abducted your family and friends. Buy our car or else.
I still can't believe how big Auburn WR Will Hastings balled out last week. A walk-on kicker? He sure looked like it too
Goggles!
I hate Chevys "Real People Not Actors" commericals so. much.
Test comment plz ignore 
Told y''all theyd get points that drive. 
You mean hotrod?Yeah, pedestrian
Yeah, but UCF is the national champion. 
FUCK YES MORE COMMERCIALS FUCKING GOOD SHIT ESPN
GAME OVER SOMEONE SCORED
This angers the Saban 
r/cfbstreams
I O!
Its good!
WHY DO THEY ALWAYS BRING US UP
Blackpink in your area
its funny that the pregame show predicted a "low scoring game" and then said 24-20 in the same breath lol
He's been money all year? Wtf are you talking about?
-2 minutes of commercials-2 plays-back to commercials 
POINTS!
ALL HAIL GOGGALOR
This is just like the Alabama-LSU national championship. Boring ass game.
They eat a lot of carrots 
How can they legally sell that product hahahah
hunter2
Rodrigo Bigdick Blankenship 
Finally, there's too much football during these commercials.
The band just an NSYNC song. now that's trolling.
Rec Specs
OMG. So many freaking commercials.
Terrible. Hate how long games are. 
What's the thing where the guy puts his foot on the ball and it goes between the standy-up things? 
Bama better win this game, we can't afford the SEC taking another loss this bowl season. /s
damn I remembering having to call all 3. 
My bold prediction: if Bama doesn't score the rest of the way, then Georgia will win this game.
GM cars that aint got an LS or a DurtyMax can take a hike, and their commercials can go to hell.
Isn''t it against the law for that movie 12 Strong to have such a long subtitle?
I doubt it. He lead Tennessee to a 9 win season. That's hard as shit at the college level. He's a bufoon for sure, but probably knows way more than most would think.
I was born in the dark web. You merely adopted it. 
Now just keep it.
Your just jealous your ad doesn't work with the Game of Thrones theme 
All I think about is the Mahk dude when I see a Chevy commercial 
Feel I have watched more commercials than football. 
First blood
I'm all hyped up on Doritos and Mtn Dew
I have the biggest crush on the woman that does the SEC commercials. If I ever meet her, I''m going to have her read a story to me in her SEC voice.
A strong field goal. 
Channels Berman: MORE POINTS
Who doesn't love high energy, SEC football./s
Let's not, it was hard enough with 10k
WOO LOUD NOISES
Smart coaching, yeah
Oh, 46 seconds into the 2nd? Time for more COMMERCIALS!!!-ESPN probably 
This punt, pass, and kick competition brought to you by AT&T.
I love his glasses.  Needs a skull and crossbones in the nose piece.
WAIT! WHY?!
The worst part is they will still consistently go for a Fg on 4th
Georgia has already outgained LSU in yards, first downs, and points
Holy shit im about to DIE from all of these commeri
Practically cheating
Wtf I love Blankenship
I heard Notre Dame and I''m like what did we do?
ball game. /s
Truer words were never spoken.
Are we watching a football game or just a bunch of commercials?
I fucking hate these “real people” Chevy ads. 
hoo boy now we got a game!
Youre allowed to wear glasses?
Yeah Cutcliffe and Gundy are pretty insightful, The rest aren't too bad either.
Someone's jealous. :p
Them glasses are hell don't they
Just 2minutes of game time but yea
The main stream sucks. But try the hometown radio feed. Same broadcast, less people streaming it, plus hometown radio broadcasters instead of ESPN announcers!Other option I like is the sky cam or the sounds of the game stream. Sounds of the game is great cuz it''s the same video feed of the main stream, but all you hear is the crowd, the bands, and the PA announcer!
First UGA points in a national title game in the BCS/CFP era!
> It gets seven thumbs up.Is someone missing a hand?
Nah that was Equifax...Experian sold a bunch of your data to a marketing firm named Alteryx.  Alteryx had insufficient data security and lost information on 123million American households.
Fr. Rooting for your conference is stupid. The SEC is Florida and 13 of Florida's rivals.
Nah, those are Rec Specs^tm
Why did he make that? I thought it was customary to miss chip shots?
Fell asleep at opening kickoff. Did I miss anything?
I like how I pay $30 a month so I could watch this game in 240p and buffering every 5 seconds. 
Wrong
A bad ass. Kurt Rambis is a field goal kicking machine !
"In Goggles we trust"
Am I the only one who thinks it's weird to root for a conference? Like, I root for teams I like, not conferences... I'm not an NFC South fan, I'm a Falcons fan. I'm not an ACC fan, I'm an FSU fan. I get wanting your conference to be the best one, but rooting for a team just because they're in it seems strange to me. Idk
It's because they have a passing threat.
Rodrigo hotrod Blankenship as the name for a kicker who wears glasses is straight out of MXC 
Teams scoring first in the NCG are 1-2 in the playoff era
A can of paint > Any Bama kicker
Now time for team meteor to hit. 
Did they kidnap their fucking families?
Let the field goal olympics begin!!!
Just like LSU in the national championship.
Sorry you had to go through that man. Life isn''t fair sometimes
C O M M E R C I A L S
Wearing glasses as a football player seems like a disaster waiting to happen ...
Poor Bama. 
How does Bama always field the worst kicker by far in every single big game they''re in?
And the Lord said "let there be a field goal attempt" and he saw that it was good
Someone should track the length of total commercial time vs the length of game time.
Congratulations to ESPN for breaking the record for most commercials in a quarter of football.
Did she just say 7 thumbs up?
So they don''t killed in the event that someone makes contact with them haha 
It helps him hit those long field goals when they matter the most 
I was watching the commercial channel and I kid you not, for like 1/8 of it there was a college football game.
6-3 incoming.
Fucking 2 plays and back to commercials
Olympic hype! 
Can we just call the game over?
Derek Dooley said it just makes us mad. 
I like you
Wait...How do you get 3 points in a football game?
Fuck Tennessee!
Do you think they torture people just by playing their ads on loop? 
We''re all here for the Kendrick Lamar concert. 
I''ll never buy a Chevy in my entire life because of that family SUV commercial. 
So this game isnt gonna be over until after 12am right? seeing that they have a fucking halftime show now
Whos brave soul tried the 1$ stacker?
It is a fucking luxury.
Thanks you based Specs
Just imagine if it gets to 6-0!
DAMN.
I've said it once, I'll say it again. Georgia's kicker looks like every Army private in any Vietnam movie.
Cause they suck at sports and thats what makes that sweet $$$
Woooo more commercials! 
Is it just me or is taco bell part of the illuminate
Alright let's see what King Ezekiel can do on this drive.
More commercials??? YESSSSSSSSSSS
When they move to a better conference?  OR, when the playoff system expands to 8 teams, like it should.
Chevy "real people" commercials give me ebola, which sounds bad but now I kno de wey. 
These commercials are ass 
Rodrigo's dad better put that kick and the rose bowl one on his website
TIL Leonard Hofstadter kicks for Georgia. 
Commercials
Me too thanks
Enjoy taco bell 666 haHAa
I know this may be unpopular around here, but after watching MLS for a year, the commercials in football games really really suck. 
So my secondary Butler Bulldogs flair isn''t showing up for me anymore, so for all intents and purposes a tiger is now a dog
NOPE
Not really. 
I am but it's the last game of the season dammit 
Has anyone seen that guy on YouTube who does parodies of Chevys real people commercials
What''s the point of love comments if I can even read them?
That's fucking weird
Wow, they actually managed to make "Ooh Child" even slower and lamer. That's actually impressive.
It'd probably look better than the one we have now...
We hit 12,000 this quarterWho takes the over?
Insurmountable lead!
2SEC4me
The hero we need. 
Kids are assholes 
Kinda looks Wild thing with the glasses on.. 
You are clearly not a believer in the goggles 
We tried our best to prevent this. 
LOL, Reddit doesn't keep any promises.
Non ripped players look funny is pads, probably because their legs aren't fucking massive like normal players.
No he''s fantastic. 
Keep the main thang the main thang
But you're a champion in life... so that's nice.
Flair up my dude
I expected nothing less
I swear there''s more commercials for the college football championship than the super bowl 
ESPN going the NFL strategy which conveniently reminds me why I don't watch the NFL
Ya see...it's the goggles. 
Commercials 
Can''t believe Nick Saban didn''t listen to randoms on the Internet
This damn game keeps getting in the way of my commercials!
This will be the final score...
Aaand commercial
>Things are gonna get brighterr/absolutelynotme_irl 
Commercials always appear at the end of a quarter, and they generally appear at the end of a scoring drive. Nothing to complain here.
You think bama is gonna make 2 field goals?
I'm waiting for the meteor to strike 
Sorry I can't take this song seriously anymore. It *is* the Guardians of the Galaxy song now lol.
If you don't like great defense, you don't like football. 
I know OU lost and props to Georgia for beating us. but I feel like with our good offense and shitty defense an OU Bama championship would be more exciting. 
Amazing graphics from ESPN
Playoff committee was determined to see a scoreless game
ffs Alabama should be advertising for a kicker on TV during game breaks
We just want to see who will play UCF. 
*3 points*YAY TIME FOR MORE COMMERCIALS!
MORE COMMERCIALS THIS IS GREAT
Those taco bell commercials are worse than their food
Words cannot describe how much I hate the Chevy man
f this, im sticking with boxscore watching and watching wrassling
Heisman snub
Theys nerds 
Bama misses field goal early. Stout defense on both sides
>That car gets seven thumbs upIs somebody missing a hand or some shit?
How else would they be able to sell the stacker for $1?
Shhhhhhhhh
Member when Alabama could kick field goals? I member.
Nice kick. What happened during that BAMA field goal, did he just shank it?
When your driving in your Chevy, and you feel something heavy...^^^^It's ^^^^from ^^^^all ^^^^the ^^^^awards ^^^^in ^^^^the ^^^^back.Buy a Chevy!
For anyone else having a real fucking bad time trying to use ESPN's horrible horseshit fucking streams - switch to the "Sounds of the Game" stream on the Ocho. 
They aren''t as big as everyone else. 
https://youtu.be/Uie-vJ3NyPk
Scoring just means more in the SEC.  It's a precious resource, not to be wasted frivolously like those other conferences.
I swear the commercial ratio to the last minute of game time is 10000:1
Do these new Taco Bell commercials piss anyone else off? For some reason I just kinda hate them.
Very few Olympians are actually this story...
Never underestimate that nerd.
Did goggles not kick that one? if so, why? 
Goggles triggers me as an ND fan.
Welcome to B1G on Fox
Love Goggles. He rocks it.

Saban better stand behind Daboll with a bat in his hands this entire drive
Damn I almost forgot. 
17-13 Georgia. That's my prediction
You're hired!
We averaged 36 points a game...
Bruh this commercial.... why I gotta have feels on football night
21-17 Alabama wins to become co-national champions is my current prediction 
I for one enjoy watching time slow down and skip inexplicably 
Sssshhhhh
sigh class in an hour why is the lord so cruel
That's if she lets her near her.  Just don't be weird.
And Georgia is the first on the board!
So, I just read that there's a "Sound of the Game" feed through ESPN Classic. My TV provider Comcast removed ESPN Classic on New Years Eve 2017
RIP
Nice
I promise I''m not crying 
That car looks like it came out of gta V
Why the shit is there a thread for every quarter?
Chat moving so fast no one will notice I fap to trap hentai.
Nice job Georgia. Beat Alabama for America.
Bubbles kick is good
Hope for a speedy recovery, man. Been messed up by some bugs before.
We''re just gonna drive this joke into the ground, aren''t we?
I'm just waiting for KDOT at this point
That's actually a really good idea, thanksEdit: nvm RCN2go just redirects to espn.com
Georgia threw a pick. Bama missed a FG. Georgia just kicked a FG
Cringe
It just means more.
WINTER OLYMPICS FUCKING RULE
So that''s how you put that thing between those two posts heh 
THEY DREW FIRST BLOOD
the belluminati has won!
Why lol. What's the stupid narrative this time? 
Good commercial
I'm expecting some obscure "when Bama trails by 3 in championships" stat coming up
Midnight tonight
Nope
Wait...
My motto for the day: Pleasegetupnoinjuriesnoinjuries
Speed skating is still a really weird sport
Im not crying, youre crying!
Sarbanes-Oxley is for bitches!
 seriously tho, Fromm looked so lost there.   Nothing he knows works against you guys
lot of hitting, pick and a missed fg by bama.
Matt Hardy is going to be in the royal rumble match

What the fuck is this commercial
Badly 
So many fucking commercials already 
Barista kicker!
Wait, did the kickoff after that field goal even happen?It didn't, right?And we have commercials now.I swear, if they play commercials after the fucking kickoff, too...
Goggles is legit
More Commercials than game. This is rediculous.
Wow so Mom's get represented by laundry detergent companies
This game is gonna take god damn forever
DAWG NATION LOVES GOOGLES!!!!
I feel like if literally any of the ad revenue went to streams we wouldnt have these issues
German or nothing for me. 
So you''re telling me there''s a chance.
This is such a good commercial. Hate how ESPN keeps putting football in the middle tho
Stop singing slow versions of old pop songs you fucking goobers
WHY THE FUCK ARE MY FRIENDS ASKING ME TO EXPLAIN THE DIVISIONS OF US SOCCER RIGHT NOW, THE GAME IS ON
Commercials. I missed you guys.
Dem feels
Because of the crappy offenses....
She plays the villain in the second season of Agent Carter in case you want to see more of her.
LOL why wouldn''t you be? 
Sorry I was thinking of Blair Walsh.
I can't wait to watch a lot of Curling
Why would ESPN show an Olympic commercial?
Wasn't trying to feel feels
So would you rather trophies talking to each other?
Can somebody get this Blankenship kid some contacts?
"Do you like this car? Let me rephrase, do you want to see your family again?"
I''ve literally missed both kicks in this game because WatchESPN froze right before
He did
That''s Goggles McPornstache to you. 
you guys... just 32 more days until Curling! 
Will the all new Traverse bring back my dead family?
Will we get to see the final form of Saban tonight?
These commercials are killing me. Can they just play the fucking game already? 
P&G making moms cry during the Olympics again
I''m not crying. You''re crying!
He did though?
Shit! Thank you! BTFU
He's become a man
He is a bama kicker.
More commercials than football is like more milk than coffee
GO DAWGS!!
THEM DAWGS IS HELL?
That commercial makes me want to watch the Olympics even less
Sounds like you are just watching a normal football game then
Skip.
Goggles kicked it.
Well when you put it that way...
Reminds me of Kenny Blankenship from MXC on Spike back in the day.
RIP Tyrod
i want to haha
He's a kicker, no real contact.
HAHAHAHAHYEEEEEEEESAHAHAH
I think it's called a goal field
Over!
I love how the University of Georgia commercial shows a guy teaching a half empty classroom. hahaha
https://i.redd.it/5bvw8lgzhymz.gif
He''s fucking garbage
Why were people boycotting
Yawn
Taco Bell insinuating Illuminati 
Watch ESPN is ridiculous,every moment buffering
ESPN....hold my beer, we got 3 more quarters.
Man, these commercials suck ASS
I think I'm pulling for Alabama since they're already an annoying dynasty, and Georgia's arch is the stupidest thing ever. 
How is that not illegal
at 9pm?
Loving the coaches film room coverage of this game. Calling plays before they happen. And so much better commentary than kirk
Is there a genre of music that's all creepy covers of old songs?  Because they seem to pop up all the time now.
So you think Bama's kicker will miss a PAT too?
I honestly decided not to buy a Chevy as my next vehicle just because of them.
Rick Vaughn
Quick point and laugh at everyone still in the other thread!
gotta ruin it with a shitty cover
Don't need the feels right now...
Looks wide right to me.
I did before I saw how tedious the anti-SEC jerk gets. At the point, if you're gonna do SEC chants, more power to ya
Buy the Chevy Traverse, because it has your family members inside of it for some reason!
If they're going to have this many damn commercial breaks, they should at least make them somewhat amusing like the super bowl ones 
This goddamn NBA rap commercial is abysmal. 
Seriously though, what's the deal with the commercials? It's not the Super Bowl. 
I'm here for the commercials
Hell they wish, they lost to the runner ups.
That's why they call him "goggles".
does Tua start next year? Does he have the chance to win the job this spring?
WATCH THE COMMERCIAL OR WE'RE GOING TO MAKE YOU DRIVE THIS CAR FOREVER!
I hope we get our fix of Dilly Dilly this game. 
All of it?
Skip m8
It is
Agreed
If Blankenship could loan PapaNasty his glasses I would be so happy. 
I don''t share it with mom
Gotta strap some goggles on your foot-specialist I guess
u/randomboltsfan
RIP everyone who took the over
Dont forget to tune in after the game on ESPNADS for post game ads. 
No, one person with two special hands
Cool
With this commercial pace this could be the 2019 Championship game too
It''s ridiculous. 
There's how you kick a field goal papnastos. You piece of shit.
Hard agree. Downhill events are fucking lit
If you were a real fan you wouldve had one already /s
Yeah, they are in cahoots with the sun.
going for an LSU/BAMA 2011 type score.  We just need to miss 4 more field goals, and we're on our way.
No, link pls!
Nope, not with muscle relaxers. Do not advise
So how the fuck do I watch this game? Other than WatchESPN, which is the literal definition of cancer and freezes right before every play but never during commercials for maximum annoyance.
Fuck this commercial 
Games gonna go off in regulation at 1 am central
All state
And they cut out the “SOMEDAY!” aka best part of the damn song. 
Yes. Substantially. 
It''s not a joke if they have a banner
Fuck Auburn
Shh, don't tell then 
The main stream sucks. But try the hometown radio feed. Same broadcast, less people streaming it, plus hometown radio broadcasters instead of ESPN announcers!Other option I like is the sky cam or the sounds of the game stream. Sounds of the game is great cuz it''s the same video feed of the main stream, but all you hear is the crowd, the bands, and the PA announcer!
I don't know about you guys... but I'm hyped for the Olympics! Curling baby! Curling!
THIS FEELS LIKE A RELIABLE LUXURY CARRRRRRRRRR
you new here?
A blowout
You think Blankenship ever puts on his glasses before getting laid? 
One more addiction network commercial and I''m starting meth. 
Right you are, Ken!
Why are there random dudes chasing a ball interrupting my commercials
Why is everyone talking about how bad we are please spare us we suffer enough. 
One of my fav Olympic sports
~Commercial break~Literally 2 plays~Commercial break~
For real commercials like these are why I don't enjoy watching NFL games because I don't feel like watching a commercial every 5 Seconds
Only SEC fans will disagree with you
**OVER/UNDER** on comments lamenting the fact that there are a lot of commercials during one of the biggest sporting events of the year: **4,598**Over or Under?
I wish we could just use the same game thread all game and break reddit...
Gameday asked him to come on to make picks and he misunderstood. 
Wasn''t the snap/hold botched?
Don''t they?
If only the commercials could be longer, then we wouldn't have to watch this foot ball!
We used to not have a kicker. 
*Game ends 3-0***Goes down in CFP history as the most boring game of all time**
I can't wait for kickoff to be over so I can watch more commercials. 
It is for me
every edgy, emotional commercial uses a slowed-down, acoustic version of a popular (sometimes old) pop song 
can't unsee....
Thank you so much. I feel like I've been here before now 
For fucks sake ESPN you must be making a killing off of these commercials please just buy some servers and fix this stream
ESPN stream is worse than that animation 
> unpopular> commercials sucklol
Thank God they went back to commercials. I couldn't handle that much action 
I thought it was just me, it feels like I see 2 plays then 5 minutes of commercials..
Holy fuckin geocities
Is that cause the seminoles shit the bed all season?
Fuck my cat. Little bitch gets up here to cuddle, but growls the moment I move at all. You got up here cause you wanted attention and warmth, but this is my couch. So shut the fuck up and let me watch commercials with a sprinkling of football.
Why isn't bulovas starting? Y'all stole him from GT and he was the #1 rated kicker y'all better use him goddammit.

Pat Fitzgerald. Now there''s a haircut you could set your watch to.

Commercials never stop
Rodrigo Blankmanship sounds like the name of a Disney Villain.
Titans/Jags rerun.
Accurate college
Are those also offered on the ESPN site?? There's literally too much lag for me to watch at all
Both fan bases in the morning...https://i.imgur.com/l9lJ2cU.jpg
Dilly dilly!
Gr8 job
I see they are going for a world record here. most commercials for a game ever, confirmed. 
These families live in what look to be multi-million dollar homes, why the fuck are they not seeing their relatives until Chevy shows up to exploit their reunion as a marketing gimmick
I just keep tuning to the coaches room during timeouts. Pretty great. It would be funny if they commentated Kendrick Lamar's performance tonight.
Thankfully on the pitch we are ahead ... substantively 
I noticed 
An hour and we''ve gone through one quarter. This is ending at midnight EST

i usually dont complain about commercials but holy shit
"I got a little hooker you don't even know about."
No way!  He's pretty superstitious.  Don't mess with it. It works. 
No I understand when they do commercials, but it's still ok to complain when espn is jamming as many as possible into the game 
Dude this sort by “live” on the Reddit app is crazy!! Comments coming in sooooooo fast lol!!!
Need Chuck and Shaq rapping this instead.
Cold games, cold heart. Got it.
Yeah he whiffed it. Looked like he started kicking a little too soon. 
Eh, missing one isn't going to hurt anything. You know what to do. 
Too soon, man
Raises hand
The crystal ball was better.
WONDERFUL. Everyone else in the Royal Rumble must be DELETED! 
Yeah. Snap was high and timing was off tbh
No, he did. That was definitely hot-rod. HOTROD.
[deleted]
And no commercials 
I went to college in Boston. Well, not IN Boston, but nearby. No, not Tufts ....
Super bowl gets brand new commercials that are meant to be special. National Championship gets the same commercial you see all fucking season but just three times as much.
ITT:  Fans who want high scoring game, but can't fathom why a high scoring team who stands around on defense didn't make it.  
Lol he was about to back into it
Yes. In fact if I was a woman I''d make him 
When you make them!
He was also pretty good? Just stop bro.
dont knock the trophy over ref!
I miss Deshaun 
Ayeeeeee quater 2 let's go!!!!!
Are you serious!?  Ouch, I'm sorry to hear that man. :(
Maybe I'm drunk but that Winter Olympics commercial has me feeling some kind of way
Oh yeah we've got the Olympics to keep us throughout the off-season!
That butt...
is there a stream that isn't dog shit? 
It has a halftime show this year.... it is now.
way over. 
That is one of the strangest things I''ve ever heard somebody insult Georgia for.
Golf may be the only thing that can kill you inside better than CFB. Golf is expensive and there's a 90% chance that you're fucking terrible at it.
Watching on ESPN Deportes much better!
Nice shot of the refs ass there
**ESPN****THE WORLD WIDE LEADER IN COMMERCIALS**
It would probably be as exciting as the Rose Bowl :P
I too like the gold horse penis trophy
The ref is about to sit on that thing
I'll always know
I noticed bro you wild
"It just means bored"
The crystal ball is still a much better trophy 
"This big gleaming gold thing"
I found a podunk station that is streaming the Eli Gold play by play despite the Alabama radio network not being allowed to stream the CFP! http://streamdb3web.securenetsystems.net/v5/WWWHFM Last weekend, WJOX out of Birmingham was streaming Eli calling the Bama/Clemson game.
He is
At the earliest
Yeah it makes the game unwatchable 
Nah fuck that trophy. Crystal Ball for life
Miss you, mom :'(
Damn, P&G ad agency: good job.
That would be great
Always upvote a Major League reference
It would make some sense as a regional pride thing, like the South vs the North.  That is kinda silly with half of the ACC being from the South, WV in the Big Twelve, Rutgers and Nebraska in BIG, etc.
"Team scoring first has lost 2 of last 3 Nat'l Championships", okay? Let's manipulate this stat to create some sort of narrative? lol
Where is Roquan projected to go in the draft? 
Hey ref sit on that and rotate
I love how half the comments so far are about Experian''s dark web scan
They have a curling club somewhere in Alpharetta . 
Hmm? Notice what? 
forgive me goggles. 
This is gonna be a 4 hr game not because it should be but so they can get every last dollar out of commercials
Putting the trophy right there is dumb as crap
dawgssssss
Because they are allergic to quarterbacks. We've seen year in and year out the SEC doesn't have some superior defense come bowl season. 
Good back going to be great. Scary
Ha! Accurate. 
Well, hopefully we can get a defensive score. I don't see either team going on long drives as the game goes on. I see Fromm having a better chance of picking up chunk plays. And of course we have a massive disadvantage at kicker, so I am nervous.
Oops im on my wrong account lol

Optimism says under, 2,500 on commercials
I wish Natty commercials were as good as Super Bowl commercials.
These commercials brought to you by Georgia-Alabama Football Game. 
why is the trophy down range?  poor planning.
Under but it's close.  
No, that's Arizona Sta--oh you said football 
My wife calls them birth control glasses
Ref is thinking get this fucking thing away from me 
Easy over
All this advertising dollars and corporate sponsors but the NCAA won't let coaches buy kids a fucking grilled cheese.

Only people with 20/20 vision can play football. 
Sumbuddy gonna steal that trophy.
I'm just trying to see Asuka get that title.
I believe there was 40ish seconds left
Gotta get that money to pay for more shitty animations 
Why are the 100+ point Big 12 games exciting but this is boring? Why does defense have to be boring? The big plays are more meaningful in a game like this. 
I feel like that isn't the best place to leave the trophy. 
IPAs and pizza rolls

SEC doesn''t have to bid against another conference for commercial time. That''s an interesting random thought I had.
Is ginger ale and whiskey a good combo? I'm out of Coke. Or maybe Brisk tea? Things are starting to look desperate 
That Mom commercial was kinda weird. 
Gotta suck to be the ref behind the trophy "Millions of people are watching my ass right now".
Last National Championship I was snorting coke and oxy's while mixing it with bourbon. I've been clean since but now I realize I did it to put up with the Watch ESPN App.

You say that like you're capable of hurting my feelings at this point

Some people like defense. Not if the offense is terrible of course, but these are apparently the best two teams in the country, so that''s not the case here.
feel like half these comments are 3 minutes late now I know why
Makes sense why the stadium is 80% fullWhy pay for this garbage

Yeah ESPN, we''ve seen the trophy a million times. Let the poor ref do his job. 
With the addition of the halftime show, they are doing their best to emulate it.
I miss you too :''(
its a term of endearment. 
Jesus, I might not make it through the game with this commercial rate. It's fucking hard to watch
Ref stop doing your job! You're ruining the shot!

Ctlr f and search free and legit stream, ESPN has one where his link leads. I'm watching it
ESPN. You suck. So hard. Commercials. Just show the game.
Pappanastos and Hurts both suck ass. Can we please get a good kicker and QB one day?
I'd like to watch the game, honestly. Instead, though, all I get is a fucking slide show from this app. Even during the commercials.
You're not even including the extended halftime because of the Kendrick performance and *Black Panther* sneak peak.This could push toward 1 a.m. EST.
Commercials come on, mute button immediately follows. 
But then they'd have to fire even more people. Plus that would be too easy.
SACTOWN PRIDE!
obv
Just you watch.
Really reaching to compliment the trophy 
Bama doesn't get kickers just punters!
I wish people would watch my ass
Bobsledding is where it's at!
Feb 8th is when it starts, I think.
A mom commercial with a bunch of cleaning product sponsors?Ballsy in this era

These commercial are really good I just wish this dumb game would stop interrupting them clearly not what we're he to see.
Can confirm that's 100% true
Real fucken low
Neutrals rooting for Alabama. Why?
So cheesy
Hop on over to the Coaches channel. All Xs and Os instead of commercials. 
Thank god for these commercials. Now I have time to sleep off my hangover, go to work, do charity work at the soup kitchen, and come back just in time to catch the next drive.
It depends on who you regularly play with.
What telecast had the fewest plays per commercial break in history? ESPN data center, can we get a stat on this?

Hey its a golden fleshlight buddy.

Not very smart to put the trophy right behind the ref.  Might knock it down and break it.
This is the best analytical statement of the year.

Not sure if Minkah is crying or snorting something 
It''ll start in 30ish minutes 
Bastard kicked it with glasses on and 1 yard further than our kick..... just to rub it in.Maybe our kicker need glasses like UGA's.

Was thinking the EXACT same thing. Not to mention its been really boring so far
BREAKING: ESPN sources say ALL UGA players will be required to wear goggles for the entirety of the 2018/19 season.

Sounds of the game is great cuz it''s the same video feed of the main stream, but all you hear is the crowd, the bands, and the PA announcer!
I could use more Maria Taylor if we''re not going to see actual football being played.
does Tua start next year?
Everyone thinks that
hope your okay Marshall
lol ref dont want to move
Nooooooooo
You''re telling me this dude with the hipster glasses has “Rodrigo Hotrod Blankenship” on his birth certificate? Even the anti-bammers have to agree to root against this manE: whew lawd. The downvotes are coming...I respect the man''s leg, but cmon, that''s a straight up 80s sports movie villain name. It''s vaguely ethnic, effete, and arrogant all in one
Ajit Pai to the Pit of Misery! Dilly Dilly
Well UCFs is the real one so..
It''s insane. 4X more commercials than actual gameplay.  At least on the ESPN stream. 
A salt shaker?
Didn''t Bama and FSU play there at the beginning of the year
I don't think the sideline reporter knows what a flak jacket is
They ain't never been nothing but winners.
How sucky does it have to be to get injured in the NCG. You finally get this far only to be hurt.
Plus the tickets on the secondary market were expensive
Imagine how much worse it'd be if he was coaching your team
That too
I have seen those! Funny stuff 
The BCS got a lot of things wrong but the crystal football was not one of them. That was a good trophy.
Did we really? 
hope only the wind got knocked out of him
Why are there so many commercials before my Kendrick Lamar concert???
AYO FOR YAYO
2.7K commercials and only 1.2K comments
second half is actually tomorrow
I will pray for you in these troubled times.
The other SEC Championship was better than this one.
Ah, shit...
*Brofit
Injured player.  Quick, fetch me a Chevy ad!
ESPN showing more commercials than the Super Bowl is not uncommon, but some of them are just stupid, (experian)
"I've been cheating on you with our secretary, Vanessa--ain't that right mom?"
Teams from Alabama have only won 1 of 3 CFP National Championship Games 
Stop. Speaking. Now.
**Nobody sees it because these streams suck so much**
Aww shit
Isn't that a dark & stormy?Edit: that's rum.
Thanks (but it's okay if you pretend)
Who had money on a ten second ass shot of a referee in this game? Collect your winnings now
WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT
I want UGA to win so UCF has no claim
Injury commercial time out now
Yay commercials back 
Annnnnd more commercials
These fucking commercials come on 
aaaaaand more commercials...
I hope so
This is how you weed out the true sociopaths
Called more commercials after kickoff 
thank god, more commercials
hands down
Nope. It sucks. Looks like a fuckin french fry
Honey whiskey is good with lemonade. Could just cut your whiskey with ice.
I hate seeing players get hurt, hopefully he's alright
Who's directing this. Too much shaky cam. 
MOAR COMMERCIALS 
http://www.espn.com/watch?id=3267580
Player down, time for 18 more commercials
Break in the action? Time for commercials!This is borderline unwatchable. 
At least our Oline is getting a good push at the line of scrimmage.
Yeah I'd go with ginger ale and brisk tea for sure
Trying to farm karma in a live thread is impossible 
Somehow I don't think he's actually wearing a flak jacket. Is he on a bombing run to Frankfurt?
Defiently a dirty ass push by that Bama O-Linemen on Marshall. 
That is not a good way to start the 2nd quarter...
Sony Michel sounds like the name of a YouTube influencer you're supposed to say you've never heard of after they do something terrible.
I've been watching the coaches film room one
yup  yup
I''m a FOOL
You''ve gotta be fucking kidding me with these commercials
Injury?!?! Get those commercials rolling!! 
ESPN are you fucking kidding me
Oh my god fuck these commercials I''m going to bed 
That sucks, Dawgs. 
Uh... That doesn't look good
Our injury bug is contagious. Watch out UGA
Maybe man. Depends on how many commercial breaks they take, so far it's been too much. May wanna find something to do and check back in 40 mins
Jesus tittyfucking christ these commercials are killing me
UGA player faking injuries just for the sake of commercials. /s
Do we have to do the god damn game thread by quarter. God fucking dammit 
Aaaand back to commercials
God dammit... 
over ezpz
Injury?COMMERCIALS!!!!!
More commercials! Oh joy!
There's been more commercial than game.  Jesus
Oh shit, I was worried they would start playing football again there
More commercials? Hell yeah dude please 
WTF THAT WASN'T EVEN A GOOD SEGWAY INTO THE COMMERCIAL?
Maybe they would make a better one.
Respect the specs
*Dude!*  This is beginning to make me think they're trolling us with the commercials. 
Man i sure am glad they have more commercials. I was worried they wouldnt have enough sponsorship tonight
Espn producer shot the Olineman in the leg to allow for more commercials, wild stuff
ESPN getting wet over the commercials they can now play
Hurts being the SEC offensive player of the year says a lot about SEC offenses. 
They still use it. 
Of course he does. Side note: I believe he is a relative of the Hanson brothers. 
HEY.  DON'T YOU INSULT GOGGLES.
I legit love watching Olympic curling.
Florida State begs to differ
All you have to do is keep your eyes on Jalen Hurts aka Captain Clutch™
Jalen Hurts surprisingly has only 1 interception on the year.
Crap...David Marshall is down.
That's probably my favorite drink of all time. So yes. 
39 seconds of football QUEU UP 7 COMMERCIALS!!
The commercial bowl  presented by $$$$
When the year 2020 comes along are they going to use two footballs for the zeroes?
Anyone else think Anna Baker kinda hot?
HotRod is his lesser nickname. Goggles is the greatest. 
I'm genuinely getting furious over these commercials. This is laughable!
Right leg got rolled up on. Shit. 
Did you just get that commercial
Wtf? Only one starter injured? That''s lucky af
This is fucking ridiculous
best damn trophy in all of sports IMO
BEHIND YOU!!
The amount of commercials is absolutely ridiculous!
Someone got injured? We can sneak in some more car commercials 
Lmao
"Georgia's been remarkably injury free"--whole team will be down next play.  
make me
Not more fucking commercials, youve gotta be yanking me
Oh boy, commercials. 
I'm going to be visiting the national mall in DC for the first time tomorrow. What should I check out first?Edit: thanks for all the advice, everyone!
It''s still given to the champion.
Nick has tamed the voodoo injury demon for his own ends.
EAT MY ASS
Yes. The SEC connection put it over the top.
"oh nice a player is injured. Time to play some commercials and make more money."
No way, ESPN would spin it off as "SEC DEFENSE IS DA BEST"
These commercials are trash
Silly commercial small businesses don't exist.
Satan
Wouldn't want tooo much football to fall through the ads
> B1G ref> Poor refChoose one. 
Hey guys, how''s the game? I CANT WATCH BC ESPN IS TRASH. 
I like the CFP logo a lot, but the trophy needs some more interest.  I wonder if even just a relief pattern on the vertical gold part would be enough.
ESPN will probably only let us see one song then they'll just play 10 minutes of ads
Root against the only kicker in the game?
I get a snicker from the guy with the family in the car Allstate commercial. 
Fuck off phone ringing
You don't like the golden stick? /s
It''s easy. Just comment every 10 seconds. 
Why do they keep interrupting the commercials with football?
The Super Bowl commercials suck this year
Passed a couple in both Georgia and Blackhawks apparel on the stairs at the bar. As a fan of both teams, I consider this a sign. 
Probably better than in the hands of a Bama coach. 
Ginger ale and whiskey is my go to if I'm mixing my whiskey. Hard to beat.
the ESPN stream is so shitty
Holy shit.. UGA hasnt had any injuries to starters besides Eason? how
dude just got laid the fuck out
I want to get one of those stupid helmets and go for a casual bike ride on the board walk. It would be so funny
I bet he got paid to act hurt so ESPN could play more commercials 
THERES NO COMMERCIALS IN OVERTIME!! 
I remember when we led Alabama 3-0 at the end of the 1st Qt. last year in Arlington <333
What? I marked that as a point in his favor. HOTROD
I do love watching commercials interrupted by college football.
This would be their second starter to be injured all year?? That'd be unreal. Certainly in recent history. Every team gets banged up. 
Gary is disappointed because who''s going to talk about Alabama making playoffs during the national championship game with Alabama in it?
No. I think it sucks too. When they had the contest they all looked bland but this one was the worst. They tend to pick the bad ones... See New Zealand flag contest 
Quick bump to G E T M Y M I N D R I G H T
We have a player that missed last year and this with late season injuries
Maybe next half.
What do the G's mean on the Georgia player's helmets?
oh. dudes injured.commercialThis game is going to be 4 and Half hours long....
Or drink it straight like a real man
All of these Northwestern Mutual commercials about financial planning involve what are widely awful financial decisions.
He faked that injury so we can get back to commercials. 
What is with all these football breaks during peak commercial time?
Are you kidding me? He''s the best reason to root for Georgia 
I dated a girl that went to Stanford, same thing.
fuck you chevy for stopping traffic.
It gives him superpowers 
> Am I the only one -no
Now the god damn Chevy guy is holding up traffic 
Fuck a live thread. LET ME SORT BY NEW THIS IS UNREADABLE 
There is no game. Just commercials
Minka and pals is r/accidentalrenaissance 
FUCK BAMA
Probably. He can sling it but not keep the job if he doesn't have Jalen's unflappability 
I don't know what's worse... one of our guys going down, or yet another excuse for ESPN to go to commercial... hmm... both... yeah, definitely both
You know ESPN got excited when they saw that hurt player. More commercials!
My man 
I would 
I want to murder these Chevy commercials. 
Betting on myself is a sucker bet
You're definitely going to need a financial planner on an architect's salary.
I rationalized it as this is a step in  building  their campaigns up to the superbowl commercial "finale"
The old glass football was awesome.  Never should have retired it.
thats big dick blankenship to you sir
WikiHow: *How to determine the final football score of a game***1)** Take the Score at the current moment: Georgia 3 - 0 Alabama**2)** Multiply Score by 1/(Fraction of time remaining)3* 1/((15+(46/60))/60) = 11.41649048630* 1/((15+(46/60))/60) = 0**3)** Final Score: Georgia 11.4164904863 - 0 Alabama
Yay! Injury! Time for Commercials!
Because they have to respect the specs
Did they just fucking take another commercial break?
Relatable 
Let''s shut down a freeway ramp so these toolbags can chat
Can i give a shout out to the ref who said disregarded the camera man trying to get him out of his shot of the trophy? Man had a job to do and did it.
75% commercial so you ain't missing much
One football and one commercial
Someone start keeping a time of game time shown versus commercials shown. 
###JD POWER AWARDS WOOOOOOOO
Tua is good. 
sorry!
Looks like it's *just* inside the left upright.
I hate Chevy so much
I look forward to the next commercial :/there we go. ugh
Does anyone know what song the Bama marching band was playing when it came in from commercial break? 
The goggles. They do nothing!
Just waiting for some Messerschmitts to come out of the sun on 3rd down

"Yes! A man is down! 40 more commercials!" -espn execs
ESPN going bankrupt = Commercials every chance they have
2k comments and we've seen 3 plays
:( No injuries pls
Dammit, I was hoping for no injuries.
Alabama Dynasty 2008-2018Cause of death: Missed field goals
They closed an interstate for that shit? Wtf
Sorry, had some drinks... Who got injured?? :/Edit: thanks everyone! 
never real people - always actors
More commercials! I was starting to think they where going to actually play...
yes they happen :(
I just want a stream that won't freeze every 2 seconds .-.
You''ve missed a lot of commercial with like 3 plays in between.
I feel bad for people watching on the east coast 
You want top or bottom? 
Kirby confirmed majority share holder of Toyota. 
Sex and football? That's a little redundant.
ESPN this is why no one likes you. We've had less than 3 minutes of game time and FOUR COMMERCIAL BREAKS. WITH NO MORE THAN 2 PLAYS BETWEEN THEM.
Have we even passed 14 minutes left? I can't tell since there have been 4 massive commercial breaks since less than a minute in the first quarter 
Hmmmm, remember back when our commercial shows had content?  Neither do I.
DO YOU WANNA MEET ME AT THE LOUNGE?
Holy shit, you called it
I want to meet JD and his associates
Go Dawgs!
Guys
Fair
I honestly think that if this was an SEC on CBS game, there would be less commercials
"I want a Chevy now"Said no one after watching those ads 
Damn, Dawgs. Feelin your pain on injuries
Was really scary at first, big man wasn't moving. At least he was flipped before the commercial break.
This game is going to take 5 fucking hours!
Fuck Mike Stoops
They better give us the second half commercial free like last year.
BIG IF TRUE
ALL COMMENTS WILL NOW BE CAPITALIZED! IT'S THE PLAYOFFS!!
Let's go boys! Roll Tide!
They literally shut down a busy highway to make a commercial. Fuck chevy
Georgia?
I wonder what kind of traffic chevy caused to film that
Gonna die from commercial overdose
Asking the important questions.

Well it's the only stream I can get to work.....

Switch to the sounds of the game stream on ESPN. There''s way less traffic on it. 
Hey someone is tying their shoes... commercial!
This football game is getting in the way of the commercials.
Bowl Mania.
Know that this game is missing? Commercials. 
Commercials. 2 plays (end of half). Commercials. 2 plays (field goal). Commercials. Kickoff. Commercials.
It's in reference to the number on their jerseys.
"We're gonna scan the big bad non-searchable darkweb for your email address!"
Yeah.
Fuck yeah finally am watching the game. Thank you dish anywhere and the local library having faster WiFi than my house so I can watch this. 
Is this what trying to watch the NFL is like every week?
Over. Easy fucking money. And now a word from our sponsors at The Addiction Network. 
ESPN: And now we go to Lithuania for a live look at Lavar Ball! Exclusively on ESPN3
I'd like some football with my commercials, please and thank you.
God damn it don''t cut to commercials. Show them evaluating the injury. I''m an athletic trainer and I want to see what they are doing 
Dawhgs
College football takes so fucking long
Am I watching on the wrong channel? What in the fuck is going on with two cameras constantly on announcers taking up screen space?I do not want to see the fucking announcers, I want to see football. Give me my screen back!
This injury brought to you by Chevy!
Gangsta

Well at this pace they might run out if commercial by the 6th OT. So good news guys.
I like these bandwagon flairs. Kudos to who came up with it
I haven't heard the names Darnold or Mayfield all game. What gives, ESPN?
No I''ve never been broke down in a place like that before. But I''d bet I would if I drove a Chevy 
dawGs
Damn these commercials. Fuck off.
WHO WRITES THE SCRIPT FOR THESE THINGS?! I HATE CHEVY NOW
Bama so far in the playoff has looked very similar to how Ohio State did against USC. Great defense, but can't throw the ball on offense
kill me now....
Yes, stellar combo. About 2:1 ginger ale:whiskey.
Brah you just gotta keeping memeing. It'll come bro. It's just super hard in a large thread.
I am an SEC fan I just think with Alabama's playstyle, it tends to make for a boring game. Not always, this may turn around. I am not looking for a 50+ point shootout but some more offense would be nice.
Oh an ad for the watch ESPN app while I'm using the watch ESPN app.I never would have thought to use that app. I'm glad I have been made aware of it.
Lmao. Sorry it's for an injury, but goddamn these commercial breaks. I may as well just turn on home shopping network. I might accidentally see more football on that channel.
If he doesn''t he must be throwing an insane amount of picks in practice, because he''s obviously more talented and skilled. Decision making is the only thing I''m unsure he compares favorably with Jalen on.
Hey mods, can we change the last sentence of the post to Let's Talk Commercials\? 
Can get get Ellie Nash and that cat back?
Goggles is impressive as fuck, dude kicks lasers. 
Fuck the auburn fan. He gets no chicken. 
Nope..7hr game
Sign up for a free week of Youtube tv. They have ESPN streaming pretty good 
they need a new marketing campaign bad
I have seriously never seen a more chopped up game when it comes to commercials. If I had a Dawg in this fight, I'd Roll all over someone's arse!
Theyre selling guilt free spending not retirement
Mom coming through with the dad joke. Nice 
Except we won the season opener here against FSU?
Keeping a timer of the commercials we have this year. This will include  half time.
Does anyone even know what the JD Power Awards are?
You guys think the commercials are bad now just wait until half-time. That Kendrick performance is going to be an hour long minimum.
All hail college football!
It's not that he can't see the weird tall yellow thing, it's that he doesn't know that's his target

Don't let this game distract from the fact that Blake Bortles won a playoff game even though he only threw for 87 yards.
Best idea ever! Right?? 
Frig off Shevie
As an LSU fan, sorry bout half of your players we screwed over 
Good times
Somebody should make one of those word graph things for these threads where the words are displayed larger the more they're used, only the entire thing would just be one massive ***COMMERCIALS***
I can only sort by live? Not by new? How the hell am I supposed to follow this?
BIG IF TRUE
The championship game between a middle aged lady, a doggo, george washington, and some randos on the freeway is somewhat slow, you're not missing much.

These "feel good" commercials kill me
Do you want to grow to resent one of our favorite hobbies? Because that''s how you grow to resent one of our favorite hobbies.
Doing my part.
I for one am pleased with the effort ESPN is making to squeeze in some football in between commercials. BRAVO!
The song one of the Bands was playing as they came back from Commercials. Does anyone know what it is? I have a video on my phone of the same song from the Bama / OSU game 2 years ago. I''ll gladly sing the praises of anyone who knows the name
those high tech range/angle finders are expensive
No wonder LA traffic is fucked. They shut it down to film fucking Chevy commercials about being stuck in traffic 
... 
Me too. If there's one thing I want from this (and every) game is for every player to come out healthy and uninjured, regardless of the outcome.
I think it says more about SEC defenses 
Bring back the original Dos Equis man
At some point in the next couple decades, the advertising industry is going to collapse. The sheer volume of ads will be too much to convince anyone of anything, imo
I miss having some plot you know?
12 o' clock high!
Green Bay.
Muh SEC championship
Chick-fil-A has no idea what most college fans are like at games lol 
Don't worry mods I'll message you to remind you to create the next thread. 
That is a freeway lane that could help pepole get home..
I think it's Bama that needs to win for that to happen
Did ESPN injure that guy just so they could play a God damned commercial?
He jogged off the field. Hope the DGD is back soon
I've read that if you sign up for it, it works like those phony antivirus programs, where it goes: "we found 5 instances of your identity being stolen! Purchase the full version for $9.99 to find out where and take action!"
Jokes on you
Chik-Fil-A's nugs are thebomb.com
They know their target. Plenty of women fans in the south 
Snorting tears
I will NEVER buy a Chevy strictly because of these dumbass "I'm not an actor I'm a real person blocking traffic on the 405" commercials.
STFU JESSE PALMER
Looks like a right hip injury. Didn't look like they tried to stabilize the knee when they rolled him over. Hip injuries suck dick, so much meat there with muscles, tendons and ligaments. 
THESE COMMERCIALS BLOW ASS
Football!
I saw a guy wearing one of those helmets on the street
Picked a hell of a time to go dry
God that Auburn had is savage right now
Go To Commercial
Because somehow I've had worse experiences with UGA fans than Bama fans. Still hoping for the meteor though.
I swear I'm one commercial break from turning this boring piece of shit off.
Christian Christopherson
Starting meth 
Wouldn''t know. I haven''t watched a non-SB NFL game in a decade.
HIT THE BUTTON! HIT THE BUTTON! 
Is there actually a game going on in between these commercials? 
I'm just sad that eventually these awesome commercials are gonna get interrupted by some football
Watching this with the hometown announcers is incredible 
I bet an SEC team wins the national championship 
I've just decided to only drink when commercials are on.I'm fucked.
Sling free 7 day trial. Mine started on new years day and goes through tonight. Did the same thing last year. I use a Roku stick.
This game would've been way better with Baker Mayfield.

I wish a semi would ploug through those Chevy “actors” on the freeway
I just ordered a liter mug of beer. I love this country.
what was the espn link without commentary from random people
I'd say hit up the museums, the air and space is a personal favorite

Advertisers getting their money''s worth. 
What''s Vegas over under on the amount of commercials for this game 
‘sup dawg...
"I definitely feel like I'm in a dependable vehicle right now"

He jogged off the field. He ok.
WatchESPN command stream is ad free. Just a heads up
ESPN: fuck you commercials 
Go to the O street mansion and find all the secret doors. They have 70 secret doors!
This is pathetic. I am trying to introduce people to football but this commercial marathon is such a turn off.
FUCK ESPN AND THEIR COMMERICIALS
You're in the wrong place buddeh
Really. I need to know about Honda for the 15th time.
Especially with that visor combo 
Commercials ruining the game
So... is that a real person or did they just make somebody up?

lul college football has way more commercials than NFL. There's a reason college games like 4 fucking hours 
The Dos Equis commercials are such shit now
Did Dos Equis just make up a person for that commercial?
wtf they're face timing Arthur blank on le batard show
Seems pretty accurate to me.
He is a RB 87 passing yards is good 
"I feel like I'm in a dependable vehicle." - says no one 20 seconds into a test drive.
Jesse Palmer might be the least interesting man in the world 
Is anyone collecting data on # of commercials for /r dataisbeautiful?
Fuck WatchESPN. THE ONLY THINGS THAT PLAY ARE THE COMMERCIALS!
I want Ford to put an ad campaign out just crapping all over the JD power award 
More commercials? HEY ESPN YOUR BALLS A TUG 
NEERRRRRDDDDDDD
100 commercials a minute AND WatchESPN is broken the entire time? Fuck everything 
The app chooses you, btw, you fucking puppet
Dos Equis really fucked up with the new “Most Interesting Man”
Playing 7d chess when we thought they were all playing football
Chubb or Michel would have won it if they weren''t splitting carries with the other (and Swift). Instead, we had two 1000 yard rushers. 
Whatever Dos Equis, H8Ball wears a cape *he* made *himself* too!
we need some fucking Doritos commercials at least. they're the only ones from recent super bowls I can remember being at least kind of funny
Conspiracy theory: The injured players dad is a advertising executive.
Can a post crash from sheer number of comments at one time? If yes, it''s happening on this post
If you're going to show so many commercials at least show the Black Panther trailer 
Question: why do people walk loudly in apartments?Like, everyone hates hearing it. Why wouldn't you be aware of it yourself?How un-self aware can you possibly be?
We need cfb on netflix
How is this stadium not sponsored by Coca Cola or Chick Fil A?
chick fli A, so fuckin gooood
gooberits a little known fact. We are the University of Georgia Bulldogs, but our nickname is the goobers
"I want a car that will get me from point A to point B"So Chevrolet makes cars that do the bare minimum I guess. 
Nothing I love more than having the National Championship on in the background and shitposting in the comments section of the game thread. 
Roll tide checking in. Hurts needs to make a good pass and not overthrow his targets. 
[This](https://youtu.be/Aj2U11FYv3U) 
I think they were just reminding him not to back up too much.
Haha thanks for reminding me how much I missed that show!
As a lifelong Bama fan as of 1 hour ago, I approve as well. Roll tide!!
You watch your damn mouth 
Maybe at this rate ESPN will run out of commercials and we'll have an uninterrupted 4th quarter.   Hahahaah jk..
I think it says more about the people making these decisions. 
I was literally saying “watch them go to a commercial” while the guy was injured and they cut me off halfway through with that insurance commercial
Thanks. Ugh. :(
Have we seen 3 plays in a row in the last 15 minutes?
At least the commercials aren't the Nissan Juke ones....YALA
I wish the playoffs and natty were on a national network like NBC CBS or ABC so more people could watch 
Yup, POTUS looking at his watch and thinking we should be close to half time, WTF?!
Green bay
BIG IF TRUE
ESPN is trying figure out how to get more commercials in this game.
What we at now? 
Only God knows
Jimmy Dean award for what can haul the most breakfast sausage 
That is incorrect. Apparently they don't think Trenton Thompson is a starter for some reason.
The Coaches Poll still uses it.
 at least at the half both teams and fans can come together in their agreement that they do not care for Auburn, and probably like riding in their trucks.
Who are you pulling for? Just curious
You and me both.This is just awful...
Oh boy more commercials, I hope the one with the singing pile of shit comes on again I've only seen it 5 times tonight so far.
Coaches complaining about all the TV timeouts. LOL. 
Dilly Dilly
ARE YOU THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE
I prefer Chevy, but fuck these fake ass "real people" Chevy commercials.
ESPN: “Yes, an injury! Time for more commercials!”
Just switch to Coaches Room during commercials, it's on ESPN News
I'm on the edge of my seat, I have no idea who's going to come out on top in these commercials!
[removed]
Old people don''t know that!
He was runnin' like a machine, though
THE GREEN ARMY!
I honestly think there has been more time away from the game than on it. 
What channel is it on where it's just the overview with the crowd noise?
I don't watch a lot of college football so every year when I watch the championship I'm stuck how much different the sport is from the pros. The hash marks really make it a different game.
This game is the best argument for cutting the cord I've ever seen. Fuck these ads
**I LIKE DRIVING IN MY TRUCK**
Pat Fitzgerald is a really handsome dude
This “real people” not actors commercial trend is annoying AF
Good times
I can't wait for the next football break during the Ad Bowl.
Alright let''s go Dawgs! A field goal is nice but you''re gonna some more offense than that. 
Or they will turn to those mesothelioma commercials that they usually run at 4 am
Apparently live been missing out my whole life

Is halftime over? 
Is this kid a significant player for Georgias D? Does he have a good backup?

Fuckin A. Literally, my wife says at the beginning of the game >wow, we haven''t really had any injuries this yearNow look. See what happens?! Fuck man. 
There's like 10 different feeds if you're watching on WatchESPN

And with these baked beans I have reached my fiber quota for the day
Okay good game you guys. Sooo glad it's over. Please? 
It is Chevy. It already is the bare min
I'm watching on my Xbox one and I don't want to watch anymore tbh
Try the command stream. It''s Was the only one that worked for me
They certainly tried to jinx the shit out of him when he was on the ground.

You just jinxed us
Only if he learns English first so he can communicate with his team mates
Someone needs to tell ESPN we want more commercials. Fuck the game.
Shit, even an Alfa Romeo feels dependable for at least a couple weeks
So much ad!!! You wonder why ratings are down you sick fucks??
You know what I hate a lot. Using a video still and pretending it's from a photograph. I didn't know I hated that until that Chick Fil A commercial premiered this season.
Welcome to the College Football National Championship Game. My bad, this is a 4-hour commercial montage.
ESPN doesn't give a shit if the player is okay, injuries = commercials
Theyre "awards" owned by the car companies to put in commercials
They fuck their sisters too.
Thank you for the non commercialized update
The coaches in the coaches room are talking about how frustrating all these timeouts are.  Yep
Glad this pesky game isn''t getting in the way of watching commercials. 
Commercials, fucking commercials
At least they can actually open the Chick Fil A stands in the stadium today.
Hoover house moms on display with those coat's. 
Georgia!!!!
Yeah, I refreshed cause I was 15 minutes behind on the ESPN app. Now I'm only 5 minutes behind. 
DID HE JUST FUCKING SAY “SATAN”?
Please make a separate post for this after the game.
Link to official YouTube NCG stream?
I don't like chick fil a politics or that they are closed on sundays, but damnit I will continue to eat there. 
You must be, the stream I am watching is mostly just "ESPN YOUR EVEN IS IN COMMERCIAL BREAK"Edit*: maybe I am on the wrong channel
This shit is unwatchable with the commercials
Drink
Checked my TV Guide, it says for ESPN "Commercials" with a time slot from 8:00 PM to 11:30 PM
Seriously enjoying the Sounds of the Game (no commentary) stream.
Does anyone have the Alabama bandwagon flair? If so, reply to this comment. I have yet to see one. 
Is there a name for that bear Bryant pattern?
But I got a new putter my wife doesn't know anything about.
Crowd shots at the end of commercial breaks are hilarious. 
It really is disgusting how many there are. I'm tempted to record it, go to bed, and just wake uo early and watch the game in 30 min before work .
I'm guessing commercials for the cfb national champ are nowhere near as expensive to get as the superbowl smh
Dude, always go dry after March Madness. 
>I definitely feel like I'm in a dependable vehicle right now.bitch you been in that car 45 seconds you ain't know shit about it most of all how dependable it is.
They need to stop putting Jesse Palmer on my TV.
15 minutes fam.
If you're trying to farm karma in the national championship game thread, you're gonna have a bad time
[Yes, that''s exactly what they''re called.](https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B004TIW0AW/ref=zg_bs_3410651_4?ie=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=MC5Z13YHEYY3R3234Q98)
Streaming ESPN1 is surprisingly lagging behind ESPN 3 home call. 
I actually want to know these results
Did they even say what team the most interesting fan rooted for?Also did he fall asleep in his cheat paint because of booze?
Your Dish  Anywhere is working?!
Now that there is going to be a halftime performance, I wonder how long it will before advertisers treat this game like they do the Super Bowl? Since everyone is talking about the commercials. 
I will comment nothing but Fuck Mike Stoops
there we go D
this kid better be dead for a break that long
Finally saw that stupid fucking best fan statue and it's disappointing, what a surprise.
7-1 7-1 7-1 B1G B1G B1G!!!
EVERY TIME
Nice! 1 down. Are we back to commercials yet?
30 mins max. 
I hate Daboll so much, horrible play caller. 
But how many open receivers will jalen miss this drive?
Fuck this Canadian Gator looking like Tim Tebow if he was born some place with universal healthcare 
With no emotional investment in this game I may be done watching. Seriously these commercials are so fucking dumb.
"What time is it?"9:10 PM"SATURDAY PRIMETIMEEEEEE"Uh no?
It stands for "Gee, I love commercials."
Houndstooth 
daw G s
> Me in any Renault.
great fucking run stop
What's the command stream 
Sometimes they aren''t walking loud and it''s just the apartment having bad floors
Unrelated: there was bachelor bumper cars on ABC.
But they would be the team that beat the team that beat Georgia.../s
hey, did you guys notice that BOTH of these teams are in the SEC????
2 plays then back to our regularly scheduled commercials.
Sony Michel long runReview*Commercial*2 plays*Commercial*PlayFG*Commercial*Touchback1 play*Commercial*
ESPN, 2 is showing the multiple cameras
Damn these coaches are good. they knew it was going to be a Hurt run. wow.
*He likes to drive in his truck*
I''ve lived in Atlanta for most of my life. Georgia fans are insufferable... I can''t imagine how they''ll be if they win the Natty. 
That seems like a poor decision given a major part of their core business is helping people plan for retirement.
Jalen is trash
Um I'm pretty sure he just called Saban Satan
He wasnt supposed to tell anyone 
People dgaf unless it inconveniences them.
I love it when Jalen Hurts can''t run. The game becomes so fun to watch
People think SEC vs. SEC will drive down ratings. I think football vs. commercials is the problem.
Let's run on the sides for a chance 
That comes after the game that way we are locked in our seats so we can watch it.
I thought this game would be boring in a very different way...
What's more depressing is that they actually are real, unscripted people. 
These football breaks are ruining it for me!
Darren Rovell has probably tweeted about it 5 times 
Why is this sport playing?  I want more commercials. 
nice.
Show us the fighting after the plays dammit
Snooze fest
Game is lower scoring than I thought it to be, but I legitimately did not think the final score will combine to be over 40
Y''all ESPN Command Center is awesome. Plus there are no commercials. 
Got it, thanks
Just say something about fuck commercials and you're good
Watching Hurts is so painfulYou know he''s not good but he always runs for a first down in some bullshit frustrating wayFuck
I think I do as a secondary
This play calling is terrible
I have no way to watch this apart from watchESPN and I want to neck myself.
This is the closest Jimbo Fisher will ever get to a National Championship game in the SEC.
Experian“We will charge you to search for your identity on the dark web after one of our servers are breached releasing your identity onto the dark web”
Awful cut outside he had 2-3 more yards if he followed his blockers.
weeeee suckkkkkkkk
I enjoy watching the CFB National Championship. It is my favorite National Championship game.When they switch to game coverage, I think to myself "yes".When they switch to commercials, I think to myself "no".
This is the commercial bowl. A damn football field keeps popping up every so often, getting annoying.
The main stream sucks. But try the hometown radio feed. Same broadcast, less people streaming it, plus hometown radio broadcasters instead of ESPN announcers!Other option I like is the sky cam or the sounds of the game stream. Sounds of the game is great cuz it''s the same video feed of the main stream, but all you hear is the crowd, the bands, and the PA announcer!
So the game is skipping like crazy on ESPN app but commercials are hd.. Unreal ESPN 
Sea of white people. Not sure if that''s because of Georgia''s demographics or because most black people cannot afford the ticket price.
**I DON'T PARTICULARLY CARE FOR ALABAMA**
TO MUCH ENJOYMENT!
I don''t understand the Chevy commercial. It''s a green screen, right? If it is, the tech is pretty good nowadays, but if it isn''t then it''s a stupid commercial. How are you gonna complain you''re stuck in traffic all the time, while you''re blocking an entire ramp? You''re exactly the problem you spend the whole commercial complaining about. 
Holy cow, is this it? Did Kirby manage to make his legendary adjustments prior to the half?
WATCHESPN'S CODE WAS WRITTEN BY UNIVERSITY OF IOWA GRADUATES. TRY ESPN'S DATA CENTER STREAM: http://www.espn.com/watch/player?bucketId=2&id=3265225
Advertising is evil to begin with. I don't know how we allowed it to exist this long 
Thank you for your service
The move by that DT was so sexy
Houndstooth
Not all heros wear capes. I want to know the ratio of game time to commercial time. At this point it has to be 1:1. 
Lincoln memorial, then make your way towards the Capitol Building from there.
UCF is sure kicking ass.
Who's ready for some commercials!
Georgia is starting to look real comfortable out there. 
The only thing not lagging on this WatchESPN stream is “The league is stacked from front to back...”
lol saban running into frame
Why the fuck are we running hurts. Daboll what are you doing
Hot Take: Hurts really isn''t that great of a runner
Yo
I think Ridley is going to be great when he goes to the NFL
Commercials incoming
I really don't understand how they've let it get/stay so shitty
This is a big momentum-swinging drive for our defense right here: a stop with a lead will be big. Hunker down Dawgs! Set a tone for this game, shut em down!
Tbf the coaches room is having far less commercials, they just keep talking amongst each other
great fucking stop!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
It's so unfortunate that so much business got into college football to the extent that we probably see more commercials than the game. It wasn't even like this a decade ago...
I comment WatchESPN command stream is ad free and literally get an ad less than a minute later. Wtf is that 
gonna be a lot of salty people if this continues to be a defensive battle
Did he just say Satan?
Yeah. It is constantly freezing on me. 
*Fleshlight
#HURTS DONUT?
I heard that as well
http://www.espn.com/watch/_/id/3267580/sounds-of-the-game-2018-college-football-playoff-national-championship
Is it supposed to be something? I can't make out what it is if so
Can''t wait for the post punt commercials.
It's a live feed. Same amount of breaks no matter what
Yeah but when is Young Sheldon on? Someone should really be announcing that every 5-6 minutes at least.
Freudian Slip
Chicken Minis are like crack cocaine in chicken form.
Alright, 4th down! Time for messages from our sponsors!
WOOT WOOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I turned the game on to see the kickoff and have been busy cooking but periodically checking to see how the game is. I haven''t seen any actual gameplay yet. So. Many. Commercials. 
nice side step! Damn!
Plus, it's brand freaking new. I hope it feels dependable! Check again in 3 years 
Right before the kickoff? Right Above It by Lil Wayne
Go Dawgs!!
If they go to commercial after this punt I swear to god....
so true man...
Anyone else lagging while watching on Watchespn? 
Bama needs to put Tua in.
Dick Satan
Come back for that Ridley. Don't just sit there.
Nick you know that wasn''t roughing the passer lol. Give em 15 backwards ref
This is the Bama o line we saw in the Iron Bowl.
The main stream sucks. But try the hometown radio feed. Same broadcast, less people streaming it, plus hometown radio broadcasters instead of ESPN announcers!Other option I like is the sky cam or the sounds of the game stream. Sounds of the game is great cuz it''s the same video feed of the main stream, but all you hear is the crowd, the bands, and the PA announcer!
Do they practice passing ?
The crowd has been defeated. Well played ESPN
Unless you're a 140 character Twitter God and super fast
Same thing
How does Bama not have a QB that can throw?
there we go baby, let's fucking go
God DAMN these Dawgs are beautiful
Don't like the jump cutting to run side ways. This game is going to be about getting the 1 or 2 yards you can get and letting that add up, can't give up yards and make your next down more difficult
it's like Trailer Park Boys cosplay with all this houndstooth
God damnit jalen
Ah, the QB run game, or as we call it, his only game.
[deleted]
Cool, man.
What the fuck is that picture 
The WatchESPN App is AIDSSSSSS FUCKKCKKCKCKCKCKC
we need to revolt against commercials. somebody charge the production van, we'll be right behind ya
ABC would be so easy too, since ABC + ESPN are both owned by Disney (and they have an arrangement for the NBA Finals).
How has Alabama never been able to recruit a good Qb?
Okay ESPN! This is what I'm willing to allow you to do instead of 2-plays and then commercials, 2-plays and then commercials:* You can use the superimposed thing you use for LOS and LTG and put corporate logos on there.* You can put some assinine animated character in the corner of the screen.* You can have "American Express 3rd and 11" from the announcers. I don't care, but having this many commercials has GOT TO STOP!
Lol the coaches on film room were just complaining about commercials hahaha
Houndstooth, but my mom yells “Gingham!!!” at the TV every time they say houndstooth
Ima go watch NFL these commercials are the worst
Our cars have four wheels, a steering wheel, and at least two doors. -CHEVY
Football would be way more exciting if one-hoppers were allowed as catches.
National Championship should always be played on real grass.
I''m getting drunk to this game
With an emotional involvement in the game I may be done too here soon. Go back to PUBG for a bit. 
10 minutes of Kendrick; 50 minutes of commercials 
Get ready for more commercials guys 
incomplete
Sky cam on watch espn 
I mean when Jimbo left so did the Seminole''s soul. So I don''t know if you can feel anything at this point.
Watching on the SEC network. No commercials! Finebaum is naked and jacking off. Booger is giving the play by play of Paul's strokes.
Tua going to make an appearance tonight?
Bedletter must've been tortured in elementary school 
Surprised that Over/Under stayed where it did.
godfuckingdammit! 
already got a few comments ready for post game thread
Commercials felt like hakftime to him, too.
I've never done that before and giggled like a school girl when I did. Now I get why people do it. 
Anyone have any fucking idea how to see this game in Toronto? I''ve been trying for an hour to get it on my phone with no luck. Can''t find it on the hotel TV, watch espn won''t work up here...fuck me
Sigh. I''m not staying up until past midnight. Oh well. 
Literally fucking delete the designed qb run. 
We're in trouble without some actual qb play. 
Fucking right!?
yah. As a Canadian it sucks I have to stream a national championship game. I would also love to watch the coaches thing everyone is talking about but no ESPN
dam, what a stop
lol how odd that youtube tv stays up til the end of the comercials then freezes for an entire series
Improviser yes. Designed runner no.
Cmon back. 
Was that the LSU T Rex guy after drinking?
come on dawgs!
When do we consider Tua lol, Jalen can''t throw a ball passed the first down line, tired of defending him. 
Why the hell is my ESPN app updating with highlights for a first down?! A first down! Idc how it happened.
So dangerous
That's what we needed Dawgs!
Nick Saban looks like the guy on the team in beach volleyball that lies and says the ball landed in when it was clearly out 
App download them locally, not streamed
Is the logo gonna have two footballs in 2020?
The other game views outside of the main one are working much better 
[Flair up or shut up my dude!](https://flair.redditcfb.com/)
Yeah I can''t stand that. I hate every other team in my conferences, with a few exceptions. I want Penn State, Michigan, Duke, State, and Iowa to lose every single game they play. I''ll admit I was pulling for the Big Ten to go undefeated in Bowl Season but other than that fuck em all..
Thanks for the heads up! 
The Dan LeBatard Show megacast airing is fucking awesome. Papi doing play by play right now
Joe Namath?
solid return back
Try not putting it in full screen and just zooming in on the player instead. Thst seems to help me with buffering
Or a kicker 
I'd love to see my cousins but they're in nose bleed.
lol they didn't
Same bro
Flags for everyone!  And then commercials
JK Scott is a senior and still has a baby face
How is it that Bama is such a great program and they always have some iffy/shitty/ok QB? 
Oh yeah it's probably not even close. Superbowl commercials are talked about more than the game half the time. 
Sports are the only thing cable TV still has. 
As someone who's been there 3 times and still not seen everything, you have to start with the essentials: Washington Monument if you're lucky enough to get a ticket to go up. They are free but they go fast. I only was able to get one on a Friday afternoon a few hours after my incoming flight landed so I had to drop my bags at the hotel and run to the monument Amazing Race style. Lincoln Memorial is of course good too, and I highly recommend the Air and Space as well as American History Museums
No one's gonna see this, I think Georgia needs to win to heal the wound opened after the superbowl
Right?
I want to see a brawl
I'd say better than with coke, too sweet
Tons of extracurricular that the camera just doesn''t seem to see.
They're trying to let you know they're annoyed at your TV volume.
SUCC
Not really. Kickoffs and injury or official timeouts they might have a part commercial/part game split, wherein the game is on the larger split, and they sometimes cut the commercial to go back to the action. Grain of salt, this is cbs and/or fox broadcasts, not espn im referring to. 
His name is Tua Tagovailoa and he's Hurts' backup.
DAMMIT HURTS
Why can't the ESPN2 coverage have the sky cam?
For real?
Fromm >> Hurts 
YES.  It seems like Dish is not syncing with the App or something
Yellow Bedletter
Put in Tua
A N G E R Y 
This looks so much like late in the year and Clemson last year. I hate this shit.
So, how many scores do we have to be down before tua time?
Ledbetter again! Bama's gonna spend so much time and energy on Carter and Roquan that big #13's gonna have a huge night
SNOREZVILLE
already*
I''ll remove it next time Montana wins the Brawl of the Wild, deal?
Another national title with an asteriskOne day college football will get there
The football game IS the commercials. 
Dos Equis Commercials have been the biggest meltdown of all time. When they started, they were so awesome. And now, they suck.
Commercials incoming!
Any game in which Alabama is currently losing is not boring in my opinion. I would be quite thrilled with a 3-0 ending. 
ANGRY DAWG
Calvin Ridley on the sideline probably screaming for Tua
I need more touchdown to stay awake
The real tragedy with this game is that this is JK Scott's last college game
That is one angry dawg.
Georgia is a very very good team. In fact they are such a good team that a team that was able to lead them the whole game and only lose of off a controversial penalty should also be considered a very good team. I''m not thinking of any teams in particular though...Edit: so basically Georgia is the best team in the country and that other team is #1.5
It's funny, commercials play just fine, in HD, but as soon as the game comes back and a play starts the stream starts lowering quality and buffering. Thanks, ESPN.
The Apprentice's Defense vs. The Master's Defense. Sorry if you're looking for an offensive shootout; it's only proper for this to be an old school slug match.
How the hell is JK Scott still around? Dudes as old as Barrett 
THESE PENALTY FLAGS BROUGHT TO YOU BY ENERGIZER. 
Two Alabama players tripped over the midfield ref lol
Eh if passing game doesn't get going soon this could go down hill.
McCarron did ok.
AJ was pretty good
I think I'm the only person in Georgia that doesn't like it. 
"Are you fucking kidding me"
Georgia get the ball back still in the lead. This offense makes me fucking suicidal
Y'all look for me at halftime. You won't be able to miss the hair.
someone is fucking cussing yo, lol
Um, guyze? I don't think our called quarterback runs are working.
AJ mcchesttats 
THWg
Good QBs in HS don't want to go hand the ball off 70 times in college.
Did I just see another F-bomb dropped by Smart?
Tua's balls might as well be on Hurt's shoulders.The real battle is this summer. 
Jalen does just barely good enough to never get replaced by Tua.
We have one.  He's on the bench.
New to football. DO yellow flags mean it's time for commercials?
Guys I have the craziest drinking game of all time, guaranteed blackout.Drink whenever:* an ad comes on
Flag? No commercials?
Is this real life?
Only one thing better in a football game than commercials, and that's FLAGS am I right?
Blows my mind. At least our QB aged like fine wine!
Look up the streaming app Sling...they have free 7 day trial 
Because they hate everyone. 
Kirby should suck up Saban and gain his powers 
FYI if you hate this many commercials, don't buy from the companies advertising. 
THIS GAME IS CRAZY
Who has the best name tonight Blankenship, Pappanastos or Ledbetter?
Well, that's weird! I thought I had set up my flair for FSU...
"FUCK"- Kirby Smart
Take a shot every time Kirby says fuck
If there''s a punt without a penalty, I will be surprised.
I'd say sometime in the future but I don't have 2020 vision
Kirby you potty mouth
Ridley is gonna pull a big TD pass against Parish before all this is said and done, no doubt.
I love hearing a clearly uncensored cuss word on national TV. 
"Fuck"
Alabama isnt playing like a championship team
Ledbetter sounds like what's going on with Flint's water supply.
[TERRANCE MOTHERFUCKER](https://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/ttte/images/7/7d/JamesandtheTroublewithTrees30.png)
We beat these two teams by a combined 35 points in the regular season, and our best player on offense nearly died in the process. Luck of the draw right. 
Lol he trucked that ref
Just start chugging your beer when the commercials starts and stop when it ends. 
Fuck the falcons
Kevin Sumlin is clearly having an absolute blast breaking down this game with the other coaches.
One thing I''ve always admired Saban for is how great his punters are. 
Eh, I thought the first one was good.  Also that dude really is interesting.  Like, I don''t know who he is, but he ain''t nothing to look at, so I bet he''s got a story or three.
We do. He's on the bench...
Aka every high profile sporting event. 
Working great. Better than watch Espn. 
The defenses are more exciting than the offenses. 
We need to be thankful.They'd win the Championship every fucking year if they had a competent QB.
Stfu
How is there an asterisk? 
I'd love to see a 12 minute 51 second touchdown drive here
I''m trying to watch my game on AppleTv Espn app. I want to watch the main game feed and it is slow and blurry. All other streams are good. Anybody have a fix?
pass interfence on a punt return. huh. /s
On one hand I'm sad I am missing the game because I'm at work on the other why would I want to watch hours of commercials?
Taylor Martinez would have been unstoppable. 
I honestly have no idea who I want to win, I feel like it should be clearer but it's not
I demand a car commercial, then a beer commercial, then another car commercial!
What''s up with all this football? I really want more advertising jammed down my fucking throat 
They could have fit a commercial between the punt and the penalty announcement
Media timeout
Can't wait for these commercials to start up again!
Too busy recruiting rbs and cbs
There seem to be more people ITT complaining about commercials tbh.
Hopefully you don't have to keep him as long as we've had to keep JT
Wow ESPN must not like money. I mean they didn't even go to a commercial after the punt.Edit: nevermind they trolled us all.
what did ya'll do with the Bama that played in the Sugar Bowl? Asking for a friend
we would call it 'snaggletooth'
theyve gotten commits from multiple 5 stars recently. no one wants to stay if they dont win the job immediately though
Smart people don't go to shit states. And a proven track record of qb development is huge. 
When are they not? 
Nice kick return.  For nought.
BRAND SYNERGIES.
Dilly Dilly
Defense wins championships. If you play phenomenal defense and don''t turn the ball over, you''ll have success. 
KIRBY SAID A BAD WORD
I will pay money to put Tua in
Probably, and I don't blame him
He eats a steady diet of Chipotle. 
> How has Alabama never been able to recruit a good ~~Qb~~ **K**?FTFY
-end of quarter commercials-2 plays-commercials after a score-1 play-injury commercials-3 plays-commercials for change in possession 
If it weren't for Lord Stanley's Cup, I'd probably agree with you.
Well I'm hurt
free legal stream for anyone that needs it: http://www.espn.com/watch/_/id/3267580/sounds-of-the-game-2018-college-football-playoff-national-championship
Lol ok I''m not the only one who heard that. 
I swear I just saw 2 plays in a row. Who slipped me acid? I have to be hallucinating 
One of my friends just texted me and said:“Is Post Malone the kicker for Georgia?” Lmao
HOLY COMMERCIALS BATMAN
4 minutes of the ref explaining the call followed by 15 minutes of commercials 
Sure take a break. Everyone sure needs one.
Of course more commercials
Oh man, I was worried for a moment that we'd have a full 5 minutes of game before more commercials
Is D'andre Walker related to Herschel by any chance?
That's what I'm saying lol
Which commercial are you in?
We'll take a break.
If I ever fucked up in football I would for sure not go to the sideline right by the coach.  You gotta run way to the side.  Its football 101
COMMENCE 2ND QUARTER KIRK HERBY ALABAMA OBSESSION
They get 5 stars they just don't develop them well
Kendrick is that you?
Lol is that fifa
Do we really need quarter threads? This game thread seem less active than the Rose/Sugar bowl threads.
I hope Georgia doesn''t defeat themselves like the Auburn game.
How are they gonna take another commercial
If nobody's mentioned it, Dish Network decided to do maintenance during the game so subscribers are locked out from the ESPN apps. Cool.
Why was that foul not brought to you by Energizer Battery??
Yeah sure ESPN I definitely want to watch an all-SEC game with 5 NBA analysts from Los Angeles who're talking about Steph Curry and doing band exercises on set
Except when Sony Michel runs. Hot Damn
Hurts has one pick all season. They don't care about good. They care about serviceable game management and following directions. 
Can't have a nice run without a block in the back.Also Georgia things.
-Michael Scott
Game minutes played 17 and 8 seconds commercials played 2 hours
Saban and Kirby are both good at making half time adjustments. What's the 2nd half going to look like?
STOP. WITH. THE. COMMERCIALS. 
I see this. I still can''t bring myself to go for them. THWg! 
you know what, fuck it... let's all storm The Benz and kill the red hat! if he's not on the field, ESPN can't go to commercial 
“We''ll take a break” oh fuck you 
More commercials!
Take a break?!? Wtf!
How do blocks in the back happen so often? Returns are barely ever 10 yards anyway 
Georgia needs to score so Hurts *has* to throw
ICE COLD DR PEPPER
Wow, dumbass play by Payne. So, so, so stupid.
TAKE A BREAK?!FUCK THIS GAME
Fuck these commercials 
Another break. This game could be over by now
More fucking commercials....
I hate that Dr. Pepper guy.
god dammit I thought they were not going to cut to a commercial
are you kendrick?
This is worse than the NFL. Fuck is up?
We just gonna pretend AJ didn't get invited to NY?
Just so we don''t have to watch anymore commercials
C O M M E R C I A L S
WOOHOO!! MORE COMMERCIALS!!!
AT&T & ESPN boardroom meeting: "Hey, how do we make an all-SEC National Championship game even MORE boring?" ...."uhh...how about 10 times the number of commercial breaks?" ...."Perfect."
We'll take a break. .Well fuck you.
wtf. more commercials?????
More commercials. Thank you jebus
Flagged for that right at the end of the play. Not smart
Shit they wouldn't even need a good QB if they would just recruit a good kicker.
"We'll take a break"No thanks, I'm well rested from 15 seconds ago.
HOLY FUCK. 
ALL OF YOU WHINING ABOUT THE WATCHESPN APP JUST SIGN UP FOR A WEEK FREE TRIAL OF YOUTUBE TV IT'S AMAZING.
At least the super bowl has original commercials...
Holy shit, I was joking about the post punt commercials
Wow, Kirby was not happy. At all.
So ive got this hypothesis that if i drink my six pack super fast, that gives my body more time to process it for work in the morning and ill be less hung over. Thoughts? 
AJ McCarron was second for the heisman. So decent maybe..
Thanks Danny. 
UGA's uniforms are fucking dope
WATCHESPN'S CODE WAS WRITTEN BY UNIVERSITY OF IOWA GRADUATES. TRY ESPN'S DATA CENTER STREAM: http://www.espn.com/watch/player?bucketId=2&id=3265225
Another break????? How many more years does ESPN have this contract?
Nah fuck you ESPN I'm out. I don't care about this game enough to waste my time on it
Totally unrelated, but I love your guys' unis
Wasn't even fucked needed. Jesus 
Roll call
Duh
Commercials are winning the 2018 college football championship
Hey, at least that "What's a computer?" commercial isn't in rotation.
ANOTHER FUCKING COMMERCIAL 
Commercials are going to kill football
Rich
I will pay money for fewer commercials
I wonder how the players feel about all these commercials 
Chlorophyll?!? More like borophyll....amirite hahaha....
HQ Trivia time!
At this point I hope the game ends with less than 10 total points and the highest viewership ever to spite SEC-haters. I also hope for the meteor to become a meteorite in Atlanta soon. So, grain of salt.
College kids can't fix the damage caused by professionals
Holy shit these commercials. Doesn't help they're all the same we've seen for 3 months.
There's been like 7 total plays in the last 30 minutes 
Wow, this really is the new copypasta. Where did this come from?
RIP
Punt???COMMERCIALS!!!!!!
Fuck your ad revenue
More fucking commercials...
both the WatchESPN app and DirecTV Now apps are being hugged to death and keep having to reloadWhy oh why doesn't YoutubeTV have a Roku app yet?
Kirby maaad.
keep it up Dawgs, keep attacking and bring this bad boy home
Final score: 9-6. 
oh really?!
Quit with the fucking commercials man
WHAT. THE. FUCK. This is awful by ESPN
More air time... Comercials or football?
My cousin will give me head if Alabama wins
someone start a brawl this is kind of a snoozefest
Wow I almost forgot they play commercials during this game in those two minutes. 
Commercials are probably pre-cached, while the stream is live. That's no excuse though because plenty of other services like FSGO can stream fine
Sweet more ads. /s
If I was Bama''s OC i''d call 4 verts every down, and tell Hurts to either chuck it to Ridley or tuck it and run
Why?!?!?! 
apolgise but english not 1st languagewill winner of game go on to play universitie of central florida?
Dude, I don't want to die.
C O M M E R C I A L SOMMERCIALS
 I heard you like commercials...
I was worried we weren't going to get another commercial break there.
I wish my boss let me take as many breaks as this football game does. 
Fucking Christ, these commercials. Not gonna miss this shit. 
[Never?](https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/players/aj-mccarron-1.html)
I'd like to make this a talking poo emoji! 
Jesus Christ this is almost unwatchable 
Glad the punt is over so i can watch commercials.
COMMERCIALS 
It makes my immature heart so happy to catch one lol 
We do. He's sitting on the bench
Fuck off espn this shit sucks ass
You'll take a break? How many damn breaks do you need?
Oh my god with these commercials. Fuck off
another commercial break? no way
This football game keeps interrupting all these great commercials! 
When Georgias kicker takes his glasses off https://i.imgur.com/BLp5lb4.jpg
3rd commercial break in under 10 minutes
holy shit, fuck these commercial breaksFuck. Right. Off
COMMERCIALS FOR MVP
I'll give up my firstborn.
Put money into making the experience more enjoyable? LOL no
Watching on ESPN NEWS. Looks like I'll be sober by the end of the he game.
Lower bowl 50 yard line is only like $13,000 per seat. Who can't afford that?!
I''m not even going to make half time at this rate Jesus fuck 
FUCK YOU ESPN. 
Yay more commercials 
I sure could go for Dr. Pepper...
We should go to commercial.  
Aw just fuck off with the commercials
CHECK THE REPLAY LARRY
IM SICK OF ALL THESE SOCCER AND CRICKET COMMERCIALS
Damn, he did play in that sugar bowl against you guys
Send me money and I'll see what I can do. 
My god. So many commercials 
I'm surprised there's not a fucking commercial between when the ball is snapped and the play is made.
FUCK ESPN
I need a Kirby Smart visor
That was an awkward lead in to a commercial break 
We now return to our regularly scheduled commercials. We apologize for interrupting your commercials with this boring football.
[deleted]
Do you want to live to see the second half?
I hate when I''m trying to watch commercials and it gets interrupted by the National championship 
Man, I'm gonna be hitting the recall button on my remote a lot tonight with all of these commercials.
Larry needs to retire.  Like Flo and Mayhem.
PRIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIME TIME. 
Wasn't that the dude who you guys were concerned about him "not being from America" or something
This is literally becoming unwatchable with these commercials.
This commercials are killing more than our shitty offense. 
Or just watch the Coaches Film Room 
Let''s take a break because fuck it?
Mother fucker these commercials are making this game unwatchable
Can you believe the charity of ESPN?Giving us football game in between commercials.
I'm having to mute the TV every 2 minutes with these commercials. This is ridiculous. 
ICE UP LARRY
/r/AccidentalBroadcast 
Not really 
Is that a thing? Who knew?
But I'm watching the game on my laptop with headphones on.
From what I've seen from fans (especially in Shreveport), we're much more enthusiastic now than we were after losing to Miami. Taggart knows how to hype a fanbase
Oh dear lord 
3 minutes and 9 secs of the actual game. Will update on how long the commercials last
THEY WERE IN THE HUDDLE WHY BREAK 
Commercials suck balls
Supposedly the YouTube Live or whatever has a good stream and a free 7 day trial. 
Fuck the saints right back.
You could get politicians elected on the promise that they would limit football commercials
These commercials are killing me..
I gotta say, Monday Night Raw is way more enjoyable 
^stream2watch ^is ^your ^friend
Is it only one play in between commercials? Ricockulous
Larry Culpepper looks like Kirby Smart''s loser twin brother 
ESPN is trying too be CBS it seems
ENOUGH OF THE FUCKING COMMERCIALS. Jesus Christ.
Oh good the Steve smith one, have only seen that 1274 times
I don't think our quarterback is working
This makes me hate ESPN. 
Just tuned in was there a delay a moment ago? Thought I saw an Alabama player hurt on the sidelines or something?
At least Barrett will take his age to newer horizons. Now we have the battle between Haskins, Burrow, and Martell!
Yeah and that starter was Eason which brought in fromm and he''s taken us to the promised land 
ESPN SKY CAN VIEW IS FREE TO WATCH I'M ON MOBILE OR I WOULD LINK
Well, ads are pre-loaded because they're planned in advance. It's not much of a conspiracy
It's so cute how people pretend the NFL has worse commercials when college football has way more and a longer halftime 
STOP WITH THE COMMERCIALS
The number of commericals in this game are almost exceeding the numbers of fans in attendance.
Get fucking set
way too many commercials
Now that we've taken a break, let's take another break. ICE COLD DR PEPPER HERE.
For those upset about the commercials, cut over to the Coaches Film Room - MUCH less commercials.
Honestly probably the smart move. The commercials are crazy.
We focus more on a qb being a manager and the qb never develops well. Jalen started with shaky passing ability and hasn't had a chance to develop. 
Just to save us from a commercial I'm all for it.
Ridley is going to be so happy to gave a qb that can throw next year.
fuck these dumb ass commercials
DO IT WOOOOOOO
Yea, I am out. This game is not worth 2 hours of commercials.
I might just stop watching. So many ads. This is actual horseshit.
This movie is gonna be such shit.
Commercials by far
The Madden strategy.
ADS ADS ADS
Great, a break. I can pee for the fifth time in 15 minutes
What is it with Hollywood and trains
Bruh.
commercial break when they cross midfield?
Are you Fing kidding me with the commercial
Lolollollollolil9l my mom is so lazy SHE OSNT EVEM WATCHING THE GAME AND MADE ME GO PICK MY SISTER UP FUCK OFFFFFFFF SO SHE CAN GO TO SLEEP 
4th in 2 minutes of game time this quarter ffs
If he was, we would have heard about it, every single game. 
https://youtu.be/15iLHlJPp_0
Literally dead from commercials 
Ok, special teams penalties and mistakes will kill potential field-flipping drives. Things like that are crucial in a close defensive game like this, with offenses that can explode on a whim.Also. ***FUCKING HELL ESPN ENOUGH ALREADY, I HAVE TO WORK TOMORROW PLAY THE DAMN GAME.***geez.
C H E C K T H E R E P L A Y L A R R Y

can we at least have new commercials?
espn is pretty gnarly with college games. they drag it out to nearly 5 hours. completely insane
too many commercials
This message brought to you by our sponsors.

That''s actually a rly good point 
Subscribe
Calm down dogs.
Why not do the split screen bullshit that FOX pulls
We're so insane to want to bench a 2 loss QB... but he's *that bad* passing the ball
This game is unwatchable with these commercials and awful play. 
And I thought CBS was bad. This shit is disgusting. 
Not in the national championship game when he''s been the unquestioned starter all season LMAO 
We should ban ads from the world. 
Welcome to B1G on Fox 
Ahhh.  My ole NCAA 06 strategy. 
Why is there a commercial?
Another commerical break?! Holy fuck. This is bullshit. 
Is this game on CBS? Geez, ads. 
Why are they showing so many commercials  This shit is making the NFL look reasonable
[deleted]
Don't worry, Georgia is playing. They ALLLWAYS start some dirty ass shit.
This shit is almost unwatchable with all the commercials. It was the same thing this weekend with the Wild Card games. 
Nice more commercials I was going flaccid for a bit.Also send chode pics to my inbox plz.
Is block in the back considered an aggressive penalty?
Then they sell the info you gave them
glad I tuned in for this commercials marathon.
Run heavy game = running clock = more commercials 
I've watched more commercials during this game than the entire season da fuq
This network spends days doing pre game coverage of this but uses every excuse in the book to show you something that''s not the game, smh. 
Media timeout
As a Florida fan, the answer is always Not Georgia 
http://www.espn.com/watch/_/id/3267580/sounds-of-the-game-2018-college-football-playoff-national-championship
Fuck these commercials with a chainsaw honestly 
What's up with the guy that keeps holding Kirby back?
Ah... the Madden strategy
yeah I can't get enough and it really helps bridge the gap from the end of the football season until the start of baseball season
Was that... Urkel in the train terrorism movie?
Holy shit the amount of commercials is just unbelievable.
This game is going to take 8 hours with these commercials
It''s /r/mildlyinfuriating type of content 
Woah ESPN, kids are watching this, control the background audio
Urkel's gone serious!
Football breaks between ads 
That's fucking urkel!
You can literally do anything and it would be better than what Daboll calls
Commercial Title Game? Seriously? How is this fair if one of the teams in ran uptempo? 
It''s been a while, hasn''t it?
Spoiler alert they stop the terror attack
Watching #2 really Hurts.
Media timeout
If I was to pull my balls out right now, would know what to do, would you act, would you know how to act?
Clearly gone with that kind of spelling.
Commercials will kill football before CTE does
Who's ready for another 9-6 final score SEC on SEC national championship? SEC! SEC!
command center doesn't have commercials
Agreed.
You didn't already?
That's saying something because the booking has been lazy the last few weeks.
Do it man. I'd do the same if it wasn't my team playing.
is 15:17 to Paris the sequel to 3:10 to Yuma? 
Damien Harris has averaged over 7 ypc over the last 2 years. What in the fucking fuck.
Eastwood sucks ass
Y'all ready for Kendrick?
More commercials...whyyyyyyy
Wtf is Urkel in that movie?! Ugh... Pam is in that movie too.
Easy. I have no interest in trucks, Dr Pepper or Budweiser. 
It''s Urkel!
This is triggering
The commercial situation in this game is approaching super bowl level.
Now timing how many minutes of commercial there are total.
Man if you''re sexually aroused by television advertising, you''re having a fucking day right now I bet 
What starts with a C and rhymes with prommercial?
Turning this shit commercial fest off.
Bama fans already calling for their QB to be benched. Shameful.An O'Korn on all your houses.
Do they *want* us to turn this shit off? The casual fan is only going to put up with so much. Another 3 and out and commercial and I'm done. My team ain't in this. Not even funny super bowl commercials either, this is ass.
hi this my first time watching american football. idk who to root for. i was thinking alabama cause they have a nice crimson red color scheme instead of that gross cherry red that georgia has
Because all their other positions except for kicker are great. Also they had McCarron for a couple titles so that kind of busts your question
Seriously, all these commercials are starting to turn me off from the game. I may start watching mystery science theater
Everyone change the channel during the commercials. Maybe it'll work lol
I think if someone sneezed they would go to commercial 
The force isn't strong with the offenses that's for sure! The kicker for Georgia is the only hope!
WATCHESPN'S CODE WAS WRITTEN BY UNIVERSITY OF IOWA GRADUATES. TRY ESPN'S DATA CENTER STREAM: http://www.espn.com/watch/player?bucketId=2&id=3265225
Turned the game on 10 minutes ago, all I''ve seen is fucking commercials and a punt...
I'm starting to wonder if there's even a game going on with all of these commercials playing. 
You get a commercial! You get a commercial!You get a commercial!Everyone's getting a commercial!
MORE COMMERCIALS YAY
Media timeout
I was just thinking the other day that I hadn''t seen Jaleel White in a while.
They make shit QBs look good, and can recruit because they win a lot
I''m sorry friend I didn''t mean to offend. 
Ads... Ads everywhere...
screw your mom
It is available to torrent. Some is actually in HD. Great comedy writers. 
I'm glad Stefan Urquelle is getting work these days
I'm just using them to track products I'll never buy again. Thanks ESPN.
only this?  what about this?  https://i.redd.it/mbiv5e1wb5501.jpg
The only winner in this game is ESPN. 
LOL coaches are being really critical of that Bama WR who didn't block anyone
Can''t argue with his prowess as a HC based on the results so far, but Kirby looks like this weird lovechild between Muschamp and Gruden.
Wow, I didn't know Urkel was involved in that train attack. 
Come on Bama offense.  UGA looks like the better team so far.
We should have been doing it earlier in the year.  Hard to put it all on him in a national championship game when he hasn't started a game to date.
You're only missing commercials.Chill out.
Some guy last week said he didn't know if it helped but he masturbated during halftime of the rose bowl.
MVP so far: Commercials
Really Urkle 
That's really smart...
Tua should come in after 1 failed drive after half unless hurts gets going. He will be the starter next year. 
So what''s the straw that breaks the camels back with commercials? When does it change?
I sincerely don''t understand how these many commercials can actually get more people to buy your product, how many people are talking or muting rn...
Sounds of the Game stream isn''t too bad. Still, tho, fuck Espn. 
I think it was
No disrespect... Our 3rd down offense is ass
Gary Sinise is my dude.
Holy shit as soon as the ref started talking the stream lagged to hell and came back to a commercial. This is so bad.
Peppah*
Yes
Hey man, if you follow the scientific method then your only choice is to test it.
I think Georgia''s gonna take this 
Yes.
That was urkle in that 15:17 to Paris commercial
NFL used to be worse but college football has passed it. 
Honestly the servers streaming the adds are probably better/can handle the traffic better than ESPNs streaming the game.
Just plug your laptop in to HDMI
You sound like maybe you shouldn''t be driving
If every CFB game had this many commercials, they would lose so many fans. 
You people talking about the commercials are as bad as the commercials. But there''s not enough football to talk about
Like ucf would do better lol
No one wins, both teams were killed by commercials.
Game flow = Zzzzzz
Got a feeling Tua will play some in this game
I'm going to bed at 10, fuck you ESPN/Disney. I have work in the morning. Ya know, like most of the CFB fans and the  students who watch the games 
"If something incredibly dangerous happened right here, right now, would you know what to do?""Uh, teacher? We're literally children""THERE ARE NO EXCUSES IN THIS CLASSROOM"
What the fuck is all these commercials lol
Now I ain't she a gold digga
Anything that gets us a title I''m okay with. 
He is kirbys belt
Yea I'm done watching soon if this keeps up
I'd prefer the Urkel as a teacher as a full movie myself.
Not on the coaches discussion broadcast
Switch to skycam. It's been actually  nice. No announcers. 1 solid cam, no effects, no hype. 
Media timeout
I am surprised they don't have super short commercials they can show during the punt hangtimes at this point.
lool
At least your schedule was pretty difficult 
I'm going to have to go to bed before halftime because of goddamn commercials.
Watch coaches corner broadcast y'all. I know it's not gameplay but at least they're talking football and it's not commercials.
"We're not born with it" I mean, some people are much more talented than others lol
ESPN UNVEILS ITS NEW PROGRAM: COMMERCIALS FOR AN HOUR, ONLY INTERRUPTED BY MORE COMMERCIALS!!!!
God dammit, ESPN, I'll write you a fucking check myself if you'll play fewer commercials. 
The number of commercials is honestly unbelievable. This is fucking unacceptable. 
My vote goes to UGA backup d-lineman Daquan Hawkins-Muckle
Don't worry, you'll only miss 8 seconds of the game with all these commercials
ESPN is going to start injuring players themselves to get more commercial breaks in.
Damn Cutcliffe throwing shade lmao. Just said a player wasnt't trying enough on a block
ESPN to UGA and Bama players: "We're gonna need you guys to fake an injury about every ten minutes so we can throw in about four or five commercials."
Commenting for update.
WHERE LEGENDS ARE WHAT?
Holyshit is that Steve Urkel??
What's the over/under for ads during k dot?
Georgia player was down.
Fuck both of them. Fuck everything. Fuck fuckerty fuck.
What can we do as fans to voice our serious displeasure at the rising number of commercials?I''m afraid the only answer is to stop watching and lol I''ll never do that.  
At this rate it'll be January 8, 2019
Media timeout
This is a pretty unbearable pace. If this trend continues, I probably won't watch the sport in a few years. That wasted time adds up.
Fuck. Not another "break". 
We saw a play, commercials!
If you have little passion for this game, these commercials make it almost damn unwatchable. 
I'm trying to figure out why everybody is shocked at the number of commercials. It's the same every year.
No please
What's the score?  Is Chevy winning?  Dr. Pepper looked pretty good on that last set of downs...
[deleted]
15:17 to Paris looks awesome. 
They have plenty of good college QB under Nick Saban, is very very hard to develop an all-pro QB. 
WATCHESPN'S CODE WAS WRITTEN BY UNIVERSITY OF IOWA GRADUATES. TRY ESPN'S DATA CENTER STREAM: http://www.espn.com/watch/player?bucketId=2&id=3265225
I know a lot of people are watching the regular view of the game, but if you have watchespn put on the coaches room. A. Gundy's mullet is prime viewing. B. No commercials. C. You pick up and see so much more.
If my team wasn''t playing in this game, I would turn it off because of the commercials.
This is seriously unwatchable. If there were spread no-huddle teams in this championship, ESPN would be the defense's twelfth-man. How can you get any rhythm when play stops every other minute?
this game gonna take 4 hours at this commercial rate
Every player and coach teaming up and chasing down whatever poor sonuvabitch is calling for these commercial breaks
Fuck off with these commercials. I've said it before...I wanna make a list of every commercial and try and avoid buying any of this bullshit.
Go Dawg
Anna
As a life long Georgia sports fan (besides GT, who I still respect), yes it would.
Damn you for losing and forcing us to watch SEC champ game 2....Big12 love from Texas
It almost feels like they are reviewing and taking things over just to show MORE commercials
Aight I was takin a shit. What I miss?
Also make sure the final score is 3-5.
It''d be different if these commercials were funny or something. Like how they used to do with the super bowl. But hell, even the super bowl commercials aren''t funny anymore.
Exactly. 
That false start on the field goal could be the play of the game
Too many. 
We had 60 points combined by this point. Boooo hiss
Put. On. The. Game. 
"Nobody's born with it" ... so is it Maybeliene?
The main stream sucks. But try the hometown radio feed. Same broadcast, less people streaming it, plus hometown radio broadcasters instead of ESPN announcers!Other option I like is the sky cam or the sounds of the game stream. Sounds of the game is great cuz it''s the same video feed of the main stream, but all you hear is the crowd, the bands, and the PA announcer!
commercials dominating the time of possession. 
I challenged myself to complete a whole 7x7 pack of flow free during commercial time this half. Currently on level 76**
What a cheater.
Lol second week in a row they've cut Bama short.
Alabama were legends are made
And under a minute of football 
You may be in the wrong thread 
Looks like Laura treated Urkel good all these years.
If you took a shot for every commercial you'd be dead by now.
I dont know how anyone who wasnt a fan of either team could sit here through these awful commercials... would not be worth it to me at all...
Me: This is a tide commercialMy wife: the laundry detergent? Safe to say I married the right woman 
Whats a Kendrick? sounds like shitty name for an artist
No way Saban pulls Hurts just because he's playing the way he's played all year. He'd have to throw like 2 picks to get pulled.Plus, does Tua even know the whole playbook?
http://www.espn.com/watch/_/id/3267580/sounds-of-the-game-2018-college-football-playoff-national-championship Not the skycam but it's the normal stream without commentators
Already caught up to real time after pausing for 30 min lol
What's Alabama known for academically? FSU for arts, Florida for STEM, that kind of thing
Does no one pay top dollar for these commercials? It''s just repeats of the same ads from all year
So is there actually a game going on, or is this CFP National Commercial Game?
They teased us there, seemed like a punt with no commercials... but no.
This is borderline unwatchable.. I can't even follow the fucking game. 
Is that Doug MFin Funny punting for Alabama?Imagine trying to convince people that you play for Alabama football.
This is unwatchable. Wtf is up with this amount of commercials???
Watch the coaches room during ads 
ESPN stream sucks!!!! In order to watch I have to stream the Homers just so it doesn''t freeze every 18 seconds.
Media timeout
#URKEL
Amen to that
Where is that?
Nah UGA has a cute doggo mascot and isn''t a red elephant wave. 
Which ESPN
I've literally never heard someone say, "The app chooses you."Ever. 
I would vote for them
What are these muscular men doing interrupting my commercials? 
15:17 to Paris looks good, no lie
ha. Dude was on fire. 
Say what you will about the NFL but they listened and they took action to try and reduce commercials. 
I''m only drinking during commercials. My kidneys are liver are going to quit. 
Wow! It's like we have good defenses or something...
We're going to be watching this until 2am, aren't we?
Is this CBS?
Ever heard that cliche, "went to a fight and a hockey game broke out?"  Well this feels like I tuned into QVC and a football game broke out...
Media timeout
Mayhem will come back. He's doing the Jesus thing and waiting juuuuuuust long enough to still remember him fondly Edit: cone typo
SEC ON CBS
Lol
Ya I know. They always have the best players on defense. They never have the best QB. Just weird that they don''t get them as well. 
Fucking lightweight 
I personally welcome the commercials, gives me plenty of time to read all of your insightful comments :D
Jimbo is on the SEC Network filmroom. I'm switching to that during breaks from now on!
Clint Eastwood don't you have a chair to talk to or something.
There have been 4 commercial breaks and 6 plays since the first quarter...What the fuck 
Media timeout
Man the coaches are on point on the coaches film room
Did I do thhaaaaat?
IT'S GONNA BE A BLOCKBUSTER  FIRST  THEN  THIS IS THE SONIC BLOCKBUSTER
So, what's everybody drinking?I've got me some Bud Light Lime (Shutup I like it)
Can confirm.Am dead.
Link?
Sorting comments by live is a joke. What the hell happened to new?
Shoulda went to bama with Lt Dan
Well, I think I would be dead at the first shot, possibly the second shot.
CONGRATULATIONS TO YOUR NATIONAL CHAMPION, BUD LIGHT!
Plot twist: The meteor hits the roof and fixes the opening mechanism.^(Or was it fixed?  Last I heard it was broken and they didn't really want to talk about it.)
These commercials suck ass. Coaching room it is I guess.
This is why I like FCS and D2 and G5 not on national tv. Well under 3 hour games.
because they need funding to fix WatchESPN
It is. I just noticed that as well
About a dozen ads
DONT YOU FUCKIN GIVE THEM THAT IDEA! DONT YOU DO IT!!!
I wish the game would stop interrupting my commercials 
This is infuriating. These breaks are out of fucking control.
Chevy needs to go
Yep
Robert Foster, all the coaches think you suck! LOL
STEVE URKEL IN AN ACTION MOVIE?!?
I'm surprised they were able to milk a full movie out of it. 
ESPN, not gonna continue watching if all I am seeing is commercials.  Watching for football not your stupid ads. 
This is ESPN and we are going to take a break.   Dear god there are too many commercials
Seriously. This is astounding. 
Honest question, why don't southern school commercials have southern accent voices?
I don't know if I'll even be able to finish the game if it's gonna be this bad. I have better shit to do than watch commercials
What number is Griffin wearing this game? Never seen the Knights in red before.
Are we at least gonna get a cool new movie trailer tonight during all these commercials?  Or is that kind of cool stuff solely for the Superbowl?
that clint eastwood movie looks like dogshit
Lmao, funny hearing the coaches audibly yelling at the players in the background. 
This.
Where else is it? I can't find it on another channel.Edit: Derp, it's on regular ESPN, I was just surfing during the millions of commercials
Thank you
No, that''s Jalel White
Not gonna be effective. The only way to prevent the hangover is to never stop drinking. 
You're god damn right. 
Dont forget to tune in after the game on ESPNADS for post game ads. 
Espn feed is shit. Im at 50mbp and shit''s buffering. Oh and fuck mike stoops
Whataburger commercials are always welcome, however.
Jesus fuck espn and these commercials 
Looks more like AKs on a Train, the sequel to Snakes on a Plane.
All these commercials and halftime performances are the issue with the length of games. Right...
Dan Lebatard Megacast > This Game 
Does anyone know what the difference in viewership is between the CFB Championship and the Super Bowl? While the ratings aren''t the same, you''d think that some companies would use the opportunity to create new commercials to target a similar audience at a fraction of the price. 
Preach.  All year. Same story.
While i don't quite agree, I respect the FUCK out of that opinion. 
There have officially been more commercial breaks than yards gained of offense this quarter.
Pat from Toyota is 10x more annoying than Larry Culpepper don't @ me
somebody point me in the right direction so I can put a fuck ton of money on this game ending well after midnight. 
Just watch the ESPNews film room. 
Until 2025 I think :-/ 
Do you like how dominant and overbearing Man U is? Root Bama. Do you have a heart? Root Georgia. 
 No glasses. Looked more like Stefan to me.
Where*
Sucks that this game has no rhythm to it because of all the commercial breaks
Great game you got here, espn 
Fuck bo Scarborough 
This has turned into a commercial thread.
Film it. Put it on the net. 
Urkle says go get the bad guys
Alabama: Fuck yeah we have a microscope in our gym now motherfuckers
I'm holding out for a halftime interview. 
I mean i kind of want to watch a football game eventually
Do you want to die? Take a shot for each commercial.
Toyota making fun of the disabled?
Really glad I didn't pay $2000 to watch players stand around during commercial breaks.
At least I''m drinking during the commercials 
Unfortunately they''re almost always going to do commercials after a three and out or score. 
I'm sure there's a commercial for it somewhere...
Yeah come back and let me know how dependable it feels when it's burning coolant and the suspension on your back left strut gives out.
ESPN showing all these commercials since they're losing revenue. For not showing sports.
We interrupt these commercials to bring you a football game.
This is hard to enjoy
Coach''s Show rarely has commercials. Just flip back over when the game comes back on if you don''t care for the smaller screen. 
I love a little football with my commercials. 
Currently getting looks from the wife....
ESPN I know you are hurting for cash..but come on man..
Man the skycam is so cool to watch the game from.
The link is there. Might as well use it.  Wires go both ways, right guys? Guys?
GET FUCKING SET
What I find awesome is they got the actual heroes to play themselves.
We should all complain at the advertisers for trying to sell us stuff when people are injured so that we get less commercials
2am Pacific Time 
I have been fucking worthless at work the day after the championship game for several years in a row now. Looks like tomorrow, the tradition continues. 
Kirby Smart's haircut cracks my shit up 
TIL this isn't an NCAA championship.  It's the only national championship that isn't sanctioned by the NCAA.
Goddamn these commercials. Anyone who actually works in advertising and does these fucking shitty commercials should be shot.
And Honda, Modelo, Dr. Pepper, Taco Bell and the other sponsors 
They're listening.
I expect nothing less FSU
Can you imagine people at the stadium being so confused at the amount of TV Timeouts lol
This is unwatchable. I'm bowing out for Netflix. Just like everything else, ESPN fucking ruins it. Fuck you ESPN
I haven''t seen one play yet 
I think the only way to stop all of these shitty commercials from being jammed down our throats is to just stop watching tv/sports. However, that's obviously not going to stop for a long time
Hey [espn](https://youtube.com/watch?v=xcO_U9Jceps)
It's impossible to do anything 
I'm working in California so it's only a quarter after six, but dammit I still want to watch 'rasslin and feed as Road Hog. These commercials are going to make doing those things rough.
Fellow Bama fans: Tua is NOT going in. Let's just hope Hurts wakes up. All this publicity about his stupid wallpapers and he goes and plays like garbage.
That was actually Stefan UrKel
Can we at least get good commercials like the superbowl?
I thought that was a parody car commercial
On mute zip recruiter ad looks like farmers only.com
wow excitmentthanks u
The coaches film room is an interesting combination of guys.Pat Fitzgerald is so pretty 
Yee haw
That's Stefan Urquelle son.
They don't actually watch broadcast TV
Fuck Dr Pepper, fuck Chevy, fuck ESPN, fuck this movie about a train and this other movie about terrorists, fuck the talking trophies, and fuck me.
TIL apps are like wands.
I thought the ad's during the cotton bowl were bad ... 
They showing so many fucking commercials. Got damn. 
Happy Rusev Day everyone!
Gimme pizza. P I z z a. 
There's been like 7 total plays in the last 30 minutes
Why does Hurts continue to NOT get his WIDE OPEN receivers the damn ball. Shit it''s getting annoying.
Tua needs to warm up his arm. Bama isn't going to qb draw it to the endzone
Isn't it sexist to require an all female crew
Yeah boooo good defenses Oklahoma doesn''t need that
Woodford reserve
The first quarter was too fast. Need to kill all momentum to rake in that ad money.
They had the teams on the field ready to go before they called this commercial
CFP trophy has to be the worst championship trophy in major sports.
Way more than that. Extended halftime for the Kendrick Lamar show
Some camerman with a sock full of nickels
Just go on a commercial break. You''ll be fine 
It's like I've got E-S-P^N I'll leave now. That was turrible.
YOU KNOW ME, DO YOU HAVE A MOTHER FUCKING ADDICTION? FIQURE IT THE FUCK OUT. 
[COMMERCIALS MAKE ME A SAD HENRY](https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/4.png?strip=all&w=960)
Only a thousand student tickets?CFB really doesn't give a shit about students, does it
theres a game playing? i thought i turned on an informercial
Coaches Commentary feed is way better. Plus, PAT FITZGERALD!!!! Gotta love him!
Quick aside because I'm a band member and this kind of stuff affects me: Shortening halftime does NOTHING to cut down on the overall time of football games. Football games are becoming 4.5 hours long because of these long-ass commercial breaks every 2 minutes. Good grief, this is unbearable. 
NDSU would beat Bama
Business. Great law school.
What channel?
That's not Urkel, obviously it's Stefan. 
"You must watch a 30 sec ad to see this play. Please turn off your adblocker"
This game keeps interrupting the ads
Local commercials suck. I live in Louisiana so they''re all church related
Perfect for movie trailers. See the trailer during the game, and the movie is released to theaters by the time the game is over while its still fresh on people's minds. 
ESPN is having excited erections lasting more than 4 hours right now
Holy shit this game is boring.
Game has no rhythm because of Alabama's offense.
I''d almost rather have commercials than this shit!!!!!https://i.imgur.com/uEsUJB2.jpg
That cut out of Saban is horrifying
Business 
Cord cutter here, I watch like 3 things with commercials all year.It is amazing how bad it is.
Say what you want, but NFL games take 3.5 hours almost on the dot. Every time 
Man the coaches are just roasting this guy haha
The speed of the game is actually good which is why they keep putting in the commercials. 
I noticed this on the nbc nightly news. I think there is actually more commercial time than news. Won't be watching anymore. Just gonna pop that channel on for jeopardy. 2 short commercials and 1 medium one for a half hour. I can live with that. Also I'm 23 and watch jeopardy. 
Won''t it be on the darkweb as soon as they search for it?
Got me some Guinness baby
I miss when Katherine Webb was always being shown 
Anyone in Florida just see that ticket clinic commercial?
I think id be fine if we never ran another designed QB run. 
Happy is so fucking good. Can't wait for Wednesday.
It doesn't. The consumer has no power in this exchange.
If you took a shot for every National Championship UCF has you'd be sober. 
bullet
....fuck commercials   *r/cfb erupts in agreement*
Tweet at espn that you are muting the commercials. 
Trying to decide if I'd rather: A. Have a fun, high scoring game with no commercials that Alabama wins, or:B. This awful slog of a game that's 1/2 commercials where Georgia grinds out a win.Not proud of the fact that A sounds pretty good right now
It just means more
/r/espnsucks should really be more active
FETCH THE COMMERCIAL STRETCHER
Fuck you another Car commercial 
I'm from the south and have friends at Alabama. It's definitely changed dramatically within the past decade because of the dominance of the football team. It's a much nicer campus with much better students than before. 
If ESPN wants people to stop illegally streaming they should actually provide a better streaming service. People will go wherever its most convenient, and if thats Watch ESPN thats where they'll go.
Sick and tired of this football game interrupting the commercials. Can we please see the GA and AU chic fil a one again??
The terrible rapping one is killing me. 
Champagne of beers here. Keeping it classy
Alabama''s entire Taco Bell student section was fratbros
Between all SEC game and so many commercials this is the worst game I've seen in awhile
What's with the college kids running around in some sort of armor in between the commercials? 
I''m fucking going to sleep over here let''s get the game on 
great cut Swift
UA in particular is trying to attract out of state students.
People at the game: "I feel like we're socializing more than watching football"
Seriously so fucking annoying 
ESPN is bleeding money due to losing subscribers and has to make up the revenue somehow?
A sip of water for each commercial would be enough to kill you
I can respect that position.Carry on.
LOL the old guy in the hat and sunglasses totally pretending to be a student.
No kick six reference? 
I don''t want to watch a rerun of jaguars-Bills this is a rip-off.
That''s the coach''s trophy and the team they vote #1 still gets it. https://www.sbnation.com/platform/amp/college-football/2017/1/19/14322518/college-football-national-championship-trophies-playoff-ap-coaches
Dear ESPN. I have to go to bed at some point. Looks like it will be before halftime
I can't decide if it is the lack of offense or the fact that I have only really seen commercials this past hour for the reason that I feel like I'm not getting into this game.
Damn, I *like* the show Chopped and that commercial was unbearable.
[deleted]
woot woot!
Whataburger is the best.
ty
I've been doing my homework for my class tomorrow, I expected to work on this pretty much the rest of the night. This game with these commercials are taking so fucking long that I'm actually ahead of schedule
Good angle ESPN ^^/s
Doubt it would be any better elsewhere.
A commercial for a new action movie.
If my team was not playing I would have already stopped watching this due to the amount of commercials
Can we get more commercials please??
We return to the game to bring you a taco bell ad
Media timeout
I hate the 'madden' camera angle 
Didn't Disney's CEO say something about reducing commercials?
Go back to soundcheck Kendrick
This commercial abuse is worse than if the Super Bowl was on CBS
NFL has it down with timing games.  
It''s all about dat Mercy life.
We watch less tv every year. Its a shock after youtube and Netflix being all you consume for months. 
Watching Hurts throw hurts me. 
If you knew you were directing an acclaimed film, would you rather cast Jamie Foxx or Denzel Washington?
THE BRODIE VS KAT
Swift is so scary 
I don't mind my commercial overlords. It gives me more time to drink. 
I'm assuming I'm not the only one whose ESPN app is taking a dump.
Woah now, Rodrigo is no random player. He''s simply the most accomplished Bulldog of all time.#RESPECT THE SPECS
Most people cannot afford ticket prices, airfare, hotel fees and everything that goes with going to a national championship game. Only reason Alabama travels well is they can drive their house. 
Y'ALL DON'T SCHOLARSHIP KICKERS THOUGH, DO YOU?
Who?
PREACH PREACHA
Not when you just came off 2 breaks in the last 3 plays. Usually they have to fit the game within a time block.
"Don't! Get! ELIMINATED!"
Media timeout
All you people complaining about streams need to get cable like an adult and quit bitching. You smugly comment to your friends about only having hulu/netflix and being "free of cable" then bitch when you can't watch sports. 
Welcome to commercialball!
If so he better be married to Laura
ITS JUST A PUNT, HOW LONG DO THESE COMMERCIALS NEED TO BE HOLY SHIT
great play call ,let's go baby
Dibs
I bet you I could get alcohol poisoning from a sip of beer after each commercial.
Because, contrary to the stereotype, not all of us have strong accents.
Holy shit...
Tbf, the Homers cast is actually pretty enjoyable.
I say that's logical
At least 10 different new movies, shows, and cars that you MUST GET NOW.
Can''t even get a decent view of the play when it isn''t on commercial 
Probably to avoid any stereotypes that a southern accent may illicit. 
Damn, ESPN getting their money's worth. 
Imagine if one of these teams was a no huddle pace offense.  Every time something happens the other team would get a break.
Jingoist, red-hat garbage. 
It's been a long time since 95.
Yup
No. They're broke as fuck why would they care about them?
I love how UGA is basically playing a home game.
Yes
**UPDATED**Sony Michel long runReview*Commercial*2 plays*Commercial*PlayFG*Commercial*Touchback1 play*Commercial*2 playsPunt*Commercial*

New game: Take a shot when someone complains about the commercials in the game thread. You'll be wasted in 2 minutes
WATCHESPN'S CODE WAS WRITTEN BY UNIVERSITY OF IOWA GRADUATES. TRY ESPN'S DATA CENTER STREAM: http://www.espn.com/watch/player?bucketId=2&id=3265225
It'll be interesting to see if Allstate responds on this next drive.
Conspiracy incoming: ESPN makes their watch ESPN app shitty for games like this so it frustrates you enough to say FUCK IT ILL JUST BUY CABLE. 
this megacast thing is so god damn dumb
Coaches room teeing off on the one gunner for not giving effort.  Love hearing the coaches.  Wish they had one of these every week.
Is this gonna be a 5 hour game?
Or a marketing tactic to scare old people
I've learned two Rachmaninoff piano concertos during these commercials. 
God damn i just wanna watch football
Ehh 
I think the game would be more interesting if we had more commercials. It would really add to the flow of the game, definitely not be annoying, and people would love the chance to look at some more ads!"I love those AT&T ads!" is what they all say!!
Can we all just take a moment and realize that UCF is the only winner tonight? 
GODS WE WERE LONG THEN
Besides the commercials, why can''t we just get a wide shot of the field? I hate all this extreme close up, weird angle shit! I know I''m getting old too because the coaches room and whatever the fuck is going on other channels is unnecessary, who watches football like this?
Holy shit, it hasn't even been five minutes in the second quarter. It feels like it should almost be halftime 
I'm just waiting for the Black Panther commercial. The rest of them suck
don't talk to the national champions like that
WatchESPN worked better during the cotton bowl. These commericals are new funding to fix this stream
Most students at Alabama are from out of state now. And I assume they don't wanna look too redneck.
Lol, the *Wilddog*?
Over/under on number of plays until next commercial: 6
Well played.
Has a football team's plan ever not been "get the ball to your play makers"?
"It just means more" Ho Lee Fuk.
Swift is scary. I like it. 
People complaining about commercialsI''m just watching Lebatard.
Wild dog
We'll nothing much has happened besides commercials
Wouldn't doubt it
Seriously why are people watching the main broadcast? No commercials on ESPNEWS and lots of good analysis
classic wild dog formation, lol
At least international football uses split screens when they need to play commercials, which is already way less often than this.This is just embarrassing.
Sober 8 years and this game is seriously making me reconsider that life choice. 
If you ever feel like the patriotic messages are over the top at these games, we literally had a marquee matchup College Basketball game on an aircraft carrier.
These coaches are shitting on the gunner from that punt. If these guys saw it Saban saw it and that kid is dead.
It's the wild dog Chubb. 
Yo ESPN put the yellow bar back on the field, I don't know when to get excited.
You've just described 90% of the male population at Alabama.
Legend (VA) Brown Ale
Someone from ESPN is gonna run on the field and Charlie horse a player so they can take an injury commercial break. 
Much better than last year''s starter, Yasir Babaganoush.
Some of you need to go back to Watch ESPN. PlayStation Vue just started buffering and my heart stopped.
Sew Tua's arms and talent onto jalens legs.
He meant reducing the time between commercials obviously, gotta make money for the mouse
Really unfortunate for him that we have this stoppage. Extra time to continue breaking down how awful he was on that play, lol.
Maybe one day!
SWIFT!!! 
[deleted]
same. watching on browser been okay.
Wild Dawg'no'
What are you, a boosted grill?
Mind sending a link. Can''t find anything official 
Once the thread returns from the commercial break it will get more... *Buffering...**Buffering...*We'll be right back after these crystal clear ads
Keep it up. Well on our way to beat the comment count on the first quarter!
It is pretty standard to use the broadcast standard midwest accent for commercials going to a national audience. 
Again! Again! Do it again!
That should be a t-shirt...
The receiver was RIGHT THERE between the iPhone X and Northwestern Mutual commercials.
For real
Agreed our guys just looked like they didnt care much on the sidelines in the bowl
HEY MODS!! LETS MAKE A PETITION FOR EVERYONE TO SIGN DURING THE COMMERCIALS THAT PROTESTS THESE COMMERCIALS. WE'LL HAVE PLENTY OF TIME TO SIGN IT 
8 min of commercials in first 2 min of 2nd quarter. Fuck that.
Nick Chubb is giving me a chub.
I run that play in NCAA 05 all the time 
Game was supposed to start over 1 hour ago and we are only 3 minutes into the 2nd quarter.15 minute quarters LUL
If we're lucky
There are more tickets, but 1000 are free
Sounds about right
Well hello, fellow tank main.
This thread started at the start of the 2nd. It is 16min old. We only have seen 2:30 of the second quarter. Literally 13:30 of commercials in the last 16min.
"it worked for a touchdown against Oklahoma"This ain't Oklahoma. Saban wouldn't hire stoops to be his janitor nowadays
Georgia is winning the play calling battle bigly
Rookie mistake
The occasional break from the commercials to show the game is pretty interesting.
Appeal to the rest of the country and globally probablyAs a person from California, people make fun of the South all the time, especially with mocking of accents
This is why I keep cable TBH.
Do the players have to warm up between commercial breaks?
Taco Bell is really cool for that ticket thing they do.
I just imagine the director for the broadcast freaking out when there is break in action. GO COMMERCIAL!!!! NOW!!!
CLUCK CLUCK CLUCK
Or get PS Vue and not put money in the pockets of Comcast execs
Vikings subreddit, I think. There have been a lot of spin-offs.  I''m just here to reap the easy karma, don''t mind me. 
Hah. Time block. You''re funny. 
I swear he said dick chaeny
Creature Comforts Bibo pilsner, representin' Athens, GA.My buddy digs Bud Light lime. We rib him for it.
It looks like ESPN is following the CBS model for showing as little football as possible between commerical breaks.
This game started an hour ago. Ugh. 
These angles are weird.  Even the normal ones are shifted to have a bigger vide of the backfield when it should be the opposite.  I wanna see more downfield. 
SEC ON CBS
Please whoop ass Georgia 
Band member at a sometimes-televised FCS school: I dreamt of games off of TV because I'd be home two hours sooner
Streaming through Hulu's LiveTV beta means enjoying commercials AND buffering. So fun in the middle of play I tell you what
Eason?
I''m done. More commercials than football. I''ll watch the highlights tomorrow. 
Testify. 
More like commercial mas, am I right?
I wonder when the Cleveland Browns will win a Super Bowl 
Oh shit, first down - time for a commercial break.
Watchespn has a sky cam only channel if you like
How do i get this?
[Flair up or shut up my dude!](https://flair.redditcfb.com/)
Saban retires if Bama winsKiffin becomes HC of Bama
Ahh time for a break in the commercials to see a few plays 
That sounds pretty awesome, tbh.
"Eason"
ELUSIVE
You're not really watching sports, either.You're mostly watching commercials, haha.

Eason pulls it*Fromm
*yes*
Niche comment
well hot dam, we shall take it, lol
I think Jim has a touch of color in his hair.
Those of you annoyed with commercials, switch to ESPN News. The coaches are discussing the effort level of each gunner on that punt.
woooo
EASON??????????????
So without two NOTs I don't think we do much if I'm just being honest. 
go dawgs!
Yeah, this is awesome to see
[deleted]
He just called him Eason!
Fromm, bitch. Not Eason. 
white boy got some wheels
Man Swift is a special talent. I thought he was an undersized scat back type but he''s got a great build to him.
Hard to say how much of this is CFP contracts versus ESPN contracts though
Lmfao Fowler just called Fromm Eason 
[deleted]
And he gets another name wrong
Fromm with a little skip to my lou
Shit, get Vue, sling or something. Cheaper and work well for the most part. 
Eason?!  
Swift the future
They never get the names right
It's early morning here so I'm getting about 7 different commercials shown in different orders every break
Did Fowler just call Fromm "Eason"?
LOL HE SAID EASON
He wasn''t far Fromm being tackled for a loss there. 
What does it mean to not live inside a phonebooth?
eason?
A penalty on a return. Surprise. 
Last time it was too many wide shots. I''m not sure they know what they''re doing.
Hahahahaha he just said Eason
Eason holds it what 
P H O N E B O O T H
He just called him Eason LUL
Watchespn is able to connect on every stream except the actual game for me
FROMM CANT RUN
“Eason pulls it” yep ESPN has lost it. 
Nothing sounds more dated than phone booth references
Literally any fucking jump cut is gonna kill this defense, playing like absolute shit.
The wire cam is the best worst addition to football. Great for replays and occasional looks but I prefer to see the field. 
That's Stephan Urquel.
Y''all got anymore of them Rose Bowls??
Did Fowler just call Fromm “Eason”?
He called Fromm Eason on that play.
Did it work?!
Did Fowler just say Eason?
That would be Fromm. The guy who can throw. 
Did Fowler say Eason pulls it?? 
Atta boy Fromm. GO DAWGS
“Eason pulls it”????
The worst part about the commercial breaks is being at the game. There's no flow. 
You need cable for most of WatchESPN. Unless you get ESPN3 through your isp 
Football 
It''s the watch espn app. I''m watching on my PS4
Did he say Eason? Cmon guys tighten up
what a move by Fromm hot dam
This game needs more spider 2 y banana 
I would also like to follow that up by asking why southern school coaches wear visors instead of baseball caps?
[Flair up or shut up my dude!](https://flair.redditcfb.com/)
Thanks fam
"Being an adult" is voting with your wallet and being smarter than the last generation.
"Drug Enforcement Agency" It's Drug Enforcement Administration lmao... no wonder that movie is trash they can't even do simple fact checking 
Jake "Mike Vick" Fromm
Fromm runs ?
Students are money later. Tickets are money now.
>  get cable like an adult Spoken like a true tool. 
You're not missing anything
Vue is sucking ass tonight too. I think there's just a ton of people watching bogging down servers.
Did he say eason pulls it?
I''ll put it on the dark web
Announcer calling Fromm Eason, wtf
Running the wildcat against Saban? Nice.
All GA backs run the ball
Wild dawg 
hey lets take a breather here guy 
Eason huh?
Fowler sucks.  Learn the damn roster.  
Eason?
Fromm with the wheels 
Never said we would
ok, I can understand calling Ridley Wims (8 vs. 6) and Swift Michel (7 vs. 1)but Eason?what the shit Fowler
Did fowler seriously just say Eason?
Did he just call him Eason?
Or, companies that advertise streaming should actually have a decent stream. For the record I''m watching this on cable.
Did he just say Eason?
ESPN Executives:"We are losing viewers, but is it because we are replacing good content with crap and lots of commercials? NO its the Viewers who are wrong!"
Damn Eason wanted the starting job back so bad he murdered Fromm and is wearing his uniform 
Chris called Fromm Eason
if espn were looking at these comments, this would be the only comment they would see.
Monte Kiffin?
GO DAWGS GO!
Did Herbstreit just call Jim Cheney, “Dick Cheney”?
Go dawgs!
Bold move ESPN. Let's see how it plays out for them.
These casters are on drugs
I heard that
All the dumb kids from my high school went to UCF
doing my part
“Eason pulls it...”
C'mon Fowler. You were doing so good
THEY WANT EASON INclearly Bama bias
Or people like ESPN need to realize that cable is a dying thing and finally embrace streaming. Has nothing to do with "adult" but knowing times are changing. 
Did Chris Fowler really just call Fromm Eason lol
They should have scheduled another game after it, there were very few ads in the 4th quarter of the Rose Bowl.
Dank.
With this many commercials we'll beat it for sure!
I was so excited there for a sec
Did he say Eason?
*Running back Fromm*
I would shill for Taco Bell any day. They are awesome
Lol he just said Eason instead of Fromm and then played it off like he didn't 
[deleted]
God I wish they updated the NCAA games. 
You do realize you need a cable account to use the watchespn app right?
Plot twist: Eason has been playing in Fromm's Jersey all year
That''s some ghetto ass cord management in the coaches box 
SCHWIFTY
Jake "Eason" Fromm
He just called Fromm Easom
DUEL THREAT 
How are you guys watching this? watch ESPN is worthless right now. 
In fairness, “feral Dawg” isn''t as catchy. 
You really need to rethink things if 100% of punts contain a penalty. 
Yup
It bwoken
I've had no buffering on psvue 
Thanks man. So much better than Espn's shitty website
Holy fucking commercials!! Can I watch the game please??!?!
Flashback to Panthers yesterday 
yes
Right now we're losing on all fronts. GA wants it more. I hate these games. 
Privyet.
I'm enjoying the coaches feed. It has Mike Gundy's Hair talking, Pat Fitzgerald, and some guys who I honestly have no idea who they are...
lol I wish
Somebody needs to get inside the Bama lockerroom at half Saban is gonna have a heart attack 
Well he''s on the sidelines so...
Oh hai Jim
[Flair up or shut up my dude!](https://flair.redditcfb.com/)Or calm down.Or both.
I'm surprised we haven't seen Tua yet
Except constantly getting our players names wrong!
If Penn State was playing and I didn't have tickets, if be the same.But I'm not invested in this game.
“Generic White Georgia Quarterback”
Let's start tackling please
Fromm got cuts
It's a conspiracy...
Fowler you''re a fucking bum. 
Fromm is trying to take Matt Ryans white Michael Vick trophy 
THE DR. PEPPER GURNEY 
Just woke up. 3-0. Exciting ball
That's how the Bama Tractor Beam works. 
Yes.
I didn''t quite hear it, but did Fowler call him Eason? I thought maybe they ran something to throw Bama off, but that was Fromm. Did he actually call him Eason? Lol 
I HAVE 477 COMMERCIALS TO GET THROUGH TONIGHT GOD DAMN IT
Noon games with the triple option do seem to go faster. 
Cable
He's made a few mistakes so far.
Yep
I''m predicting the second half looks like this:- Dr. Pepper- SEC- Chevy- Apple- SEC- Nationwide- Movie- Football play- Capital One- Dr. Pepper- Beer- Another beer- SEC or university commercial- cut back to announcers- Papa Johns- Chevy- Honda- Crowd shot- Play- Timeout- Taco Bell- SEC- ESPN commercialThat should get us to the 2 minute warning around midnight or so.
Honestly what is the play-to-commercial ratio? It has to be close to 1:1.
Did he just say Eason?
He's getting a lot of UGA players confused. 
It''s been awful all year.  Glad I''m not the only one. 
Go home Chris you''re drunk
Yes
I've never seen anything quite like these Megacast things on the extra ESPN channels.
The Fromm King. 
Eason
Wonder if espn is making Georgia go hurry up so they can get to commercials sooner 
Yep
Anyone else just lose the feed?
Seriously. Daboll''s playcalling will lose us this game. 
Really hard to choose a team to root for 
Did he just call Fromm Eason?
dude said Eason and blew my mind
God. This is weirdest national championship game.
> ~~Watch~~ESPN is ass my dudes
What if right before Kendrick''s performance they drop a surprise trailer for NCAA Football 19
Jake Fromm was inspired by Blake Bortles
Fromm coming straight out of middle earth
Inaccurate? The pass got tipped didn't it?
Murica!
Sling has no locals so I just get the annoying music over and over
“Eason pulls it” wtf announcers 
The freezing UGA fan one
Can we have a coaches room for more games? I love this
~~If you''re Georgia and Fromm struggles, do you think of switching to Eason? ~~ dude is slinging it now 
sling is perfect for once
That''s some crazy perspective when he said he was in prom last year lol 
LLWS DRINK
They''re surely not living inside a phone booth tonight. Whatever that means. 
Set during the first quarter of the Rose Bowl.
I thought the same thing and I wasn''t sure
ESP Nads 
ESPN''s response: “okay cool.” *shreds petition*
Eason is playing great today 
Matt Vick***
[**ME REALIZING THIS IS THE LAST GAME THREAD OF THE SEASON.**](https://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/hello-darkness-gob-gif-wall-4.gif?w=650)    
A lot of people forget that some teams employ the method of throwing it to the offensive linemen and hoping for the best
So you mean to tell me ESPN is showing this game on all their channels, and LaVar Ball isn't a part of *any* of those broadcasts?Impressive show of restraint, honestly.
Well you're not wromg.
YouTube TV free trial
Fowler, you interested in this game?
When From is under center you can tell the direction of the play by his feet before the snap
Most of us sound just like everyone else, we just say y'all more. 
What this game is teaching me so far is how ridiculously well executed Oklahoma's offense is. Georgia's defense playing light years better in this first half compared to last week
Both your opinion, and your downvote, are appreciated.  I hope you feel better.
Lmao if he's juking us out its over
How many future broadcast contracts has ESPN cost itself in the last 2 years?
It was truly an impressive run there from Eason
She''s always the elephant in the room so I just pick her immediately now. Relieves a lot of frustration I have with comp.
Can't wait to watch an AFC East vs AFC West Superbowl! Wouldn't that be great?
Fowler: Great move by Easton. Umm - pretty sure that's Jake Fromm
Scenes. 
Apparently ive been missing out my whole life. Pretty damn good
go dwags

[A message from Lane](https://twitter.com/lane_kiffin/status/950544378849910784)
Did they just call Fromm Eason?
Interesting flair. I actually transferred from PSU to tech lol
I would cry with joy. 
I was born in 1995. I don't know what that is.
Nothing like calling a star QB by the name of his backup who hasn't played in four months, amiright?
Lol Eason?  hasn't played since week 1 how do you make that mistake
LLWS reference.. Everyone drink.
Do a lot of people live in phone booths?Posted from my cell phone.

Man watching this coaches room stream is awesome. I think I'm a duke fan now.
3rd and long. GET. OFF. THE. FIELD.
You can watch a frame every few minutes on watch espn!
spider 2 y right banana
Clemson played a couple of non-widely televised games this season and they were over with in a little under 3 hours. Weirdest feeling ever.
Oh no they just mentioned every Fromm factoid out there. We're going to die tonight
Hey, they're showing a football game between commercials! Sweet!
W H I T E Q B R U N N I N GHITEQBRUNNING
10-3 final score
Biggest winner of all!
Best thing ever
I''d cry 
I had to double check and make sure I didn't miss an injury due to commercial induced PTSD.
I've seen too many plays in a row. My eyes are really strained right now. It would be nice if the cable companies could slip in a couple of commercials between each play or two to give my eyes a rest
[deleted]
Guys guys guys the commercials are so ESPN can pay all the new people they've hired these past few months..
The coaches'' commentary on ESPNN is cool as heck.
Yeah he doesn''t know who''s playing lol. Just shouting random names at this point. 
Their sounds of the game stream is pretty solid. No announcers though.
Bigger response than the Black Panther trailer
I don't think that's legal
I really appreciate how the announcer knew how to pronounce Houston County
2 more
https://youtu.be/xTfS0nAgfuE
I wish Alabama could go back to the good old pocket passer with a little mobility, but no, lets get a predator look a like who is scared to throw.
Hey, I live in China and would like to watch college football. How am I supposed to "get cable like an adult"?
Pls
Nfl is doing that now too so wtf?
This game is so hard to watch. Barely any scoring, and death by commercials. dear god, why is my life so fucking hard
Did anyone hear the announcer call Sabam "Satin"? Ha. Classic stuff.
Yep, earlier he called Ridley Wins...these guys suck
That would be almost as fire as Kendrick's performance 
He called him Eason. 
It's still awarded to the champion. It's just a secondary piece of hardware instead of the premier trophy.
heard this as well
We purchase cable tv...
I was about to say that's way too low, then I saw you said plays. I still think it's too low
COME ON GEORGIA 
I switched over to the WatchESPN "Command Center" and it's been working great for me. Probably a lot fewer people on this stream.
Saying Eason is the QB is like failing an open note test.
How about just a competent qb.  Give me fucking coker, mcelroy,hell, even JPW.
Hmm, thanks. I'll keep an eye out.>I''m just here to reap the easy karma, don''t mind me.No judgments at all, my man. Karma is karma.
Our offense is garbage, which is going to wear about our defense.
Phrase of the first half: "Should have pulled it."
I have Direct TV Now so I guess it''s “internet cable.” Running like shit periodically. 
Fromm looks a lot more nervous in this gameThan the Oklahoma one 
Bills v Jags is rubbing off
In a perfect world..
I wonder, how much does having a slim lead against Alabama feel like trying to run it from under a falling building
Doesn't look like anything to me....Nah, you're good husker.
No. Raw is more enjoyable than this gsme
Go on...
Because they pay 10k-20k a year in tuition I guess
No the commercials win
BRING ME THE COMMERCIAL-BREAK STRETCHER!
No commercial break in between plays?
Satan?
I love how watchespn only works in between plays
Is Georgia any good? I''ll hang up and listen.
Did anyone watch that documentary on Fromm that floated around a while ago?    I wish I had a documentary as a high school student. 
[removed]
NO
If you don''t like commercials blame the three and outs. 
I may be ignorant, but I have never heard anyone outside of ESPN refer to Russell Westbrook as “The Brodie.”  Always Russ, RW, or Westbrook.  
Maybe everybody would stop complaining about the commercials and the WatchESPN
R.I.P. Number 47 from Georgia
great fucking throw 
Satan?
LIL BRO 
Finally. 
Nice
DAWGS
Sadness. I'm working for my university right now:/
BIG DAWG SZN
fat boi Jim Chaney has gone goth for this game
Or, the Big 12 defense sucks. 
Did you know Calvin and Riley are brothers?
Ridley > Ridley
LET'S GO BABY!
Fuck ESPN holy shit, how can you not figure out how to stream. Hope they go bankrupt
I can''t hear that name without thinking of The Good Place 
WOo
this bama defense sucks
Lmao THE WRONG RIDLEY 
Yeah we are gonna lose lol
Commercial saving catch!
that was a nice pass
Little Ridley!
Get a fucking name right ESPN
Riley > Calvin 
[deleted]
That's why I started playing tanks. Nobody usually complains and I can just do what I want.
Just fed my cat wet food and he ate it and is STILL meowing
You can download updated rosters!!! A new game would be sweet though. Although we would have an Ultimate Team mode...hope they  would at least call it NUT.
Holy shit he was Julio Jones against the Rams open.
ESPN app stream is trash, r/cfbstreams is showing no love. feelsbadman.guess ill watch the highlights later 
[deleted]
What is the mom feeding these Ridley kids 
Wow, kind of surprised with bama defense on that one.
Not getting any points on the first drive for Bama changed the momentum of this game
That blocking gave me a boner
You can download custom updated rosters pretty easily
The main stream sucks. But try the hometown radio feed. Same broadcast, less people streaming it, plus hometown radio broadcasters instead of ESPN announcers!Other option I like is the sky cam or the sounds of the game stream. Sounds of the game is great cuz it''s the same video feed of the main stream, but all you hear is the crowd, the bands, and the PA announcer!
Vulva logo trophy 
Our players were so much more hyped than yours. We didn't win because we were a better team, we won because we were a better team at one point
nice fucking throw Jake
Wide the fuck open.
I like this Ridley.
That was a Riley good catch. 
I wonder why
I wish our band had pom poms...
I'm surprised they can talk with fromms dick so far down their throat. 
Words are hard for Chris Fowler
Bama hatred is a powerful force
[deleted]
your usual 16.5 step drop.
Keep Alabama off the field and out of sync 
dawgs r barking
Me niether!
Great job picking up the blitz
The Fromm Bomb is clearer for takeoff
I'm surprised we haven't gone to the idoicracy-esqe of constant commercials brimming the screen
UCF says miss me yet? :)
I choose to believe this. 
Same guy who did the block in the back
I can literally only get so erect
NFL isn't on cable except for Monday night football games 
Boooooooooooo!!! We want more possession changes!Show us more commercials!!!!
Damn, burnt them
*lunchpail player intensifies*
Who played in the LLWS? 
Anyone else thinks hurts has a concussion from that first half tackle? Back of his head hit hard. Not sure he is 100%.
I'm excited for the first down as it means I don't have to watch another commercial for 2 minutes.
Nope, there's two more after halftime
Bandwagon PSU fan. IDK why. I just like them. Entertaining team to watch.
Nice job by Fromm to stick that right over the LB 
Probably at half time I will.  Then with watching before work I won't have to hide from the internet all day either.
Is Herb having a stroke? Eason? Satin?
ww great play right there
bro this is gonna be such a low scoring game.
Yep
Yep they''re gonna call him little brother all night
Get dude out of the booth. He can't pronounce names correctly, and when he does its not that person making the play. fuck
Georgia radio room stream is pretty good for those who have to use the app.edit: Fuck I made a mistake by telling all of you, starting to dip in and out of quality now
B-E-A-UTIFUL
Georgia did a great job of establishing a run game and now they''re finding holes in the secondary.  This is excellent to watch.
The commercials aren''t why I will never buy a Chevy. 
Can someone explain why the Oklahoma defense is on the field wearing Bama jerseys rn?
Same song and dance as last year. Fuckin put in Tua and leave Jalen as RB. 
Bamas band director girl as an ass..dayum
Ooooo that in-stadium stat tower is really sweet.
Georgia OC playing 4d chess. Alabama OC playing pong. 
2010 version preferably 
The main ESPN stream sucks. But try the hometown radio feed.

Sounds of the game is great cuz it''s the same video feed of the main stream, but all you hear is the crowd, the bands, and the PA announcer!
Are Alabama fans or ESPN more pissed about the first down conversion?
Welcome to 2018 where ESPN still can't manage to stream a single game without stutter and crashes every 30 seconds.
oh shit one of these QBs can actually pass
Uhhh why do Fowler and Herbie keep messing up names
Hey it's Little Brother (tm)!
#ROLL DAWG
(With consent)
The trick play to end all trick plays.
3-6 on 3rd down, basically our season average. 
WHOOOO
We need to get off the field on third down
this
WOW when the blitz doesn't get home, their receivers are wide fucking open.
Did you know Riley Ridley is Calvin Ridley's little brother?!!!
Fromm''s gonna be a star
HELL YES!
[DEEP BREATH]wrong.
go daggs. 
Alabama is daring UGA to throw downfield.
been like that for about 5 years now
YouTube TV has been my friend 
Great conversion
It really is pathetic. The local NBC affiliate here can stream NBA games perfectly but "The worldwide leader" can't run a competent stream.
Don't forget buffering
the champ is here
To people on watch espn, try just the ESPN app. For some reason they just gave up on the watch one and on other programs that I couldn't be at the TV I've had good experiences with the regular ESPN app
Watching college teams complete passes really confuses me.
Riley Ridley > Calvin Ridley don''t @ me
Having a RB for a QB will hurt Bama''s chances of matching Georgia''s offense.
This reminds me of that episode of *Game Of Thrones* where the *Main Character* almost *died* but *did not* 
great drive dawgs, keep it up
For real thanks for the link. You could've worded it a little nicer, but thank you nonetheless.
Georgia looking pretty good rn\#HotTake
Third and long right where they want us.....
I mean they're all over 18
Go bears!
Lol it sure as hell isn't gonna be you guys like your AD claims it will #Power6 though
Michigan fans be like "Wow... so this is what an offense is. Amazing."
Has the stream improved 
Fun fact: Riley Ridley is Calvin Ridley''s younger brother. 
I see finebaum chizik and McElroy?
Georgia's O-Line really protecting well
COVER HIM
hot take
That pass was minimally better than the intentional grounding in the Rose Bowl
D A W G S
I bet Yelawolf is slangin some Alabama slanguage right about now.
You mean Satin
Fromm saving us from more commercials
Did not know Riley's name was Cavin. lol wtf mom and dad?
That's what I'm watching :(
DAWGS!
Satan*
Too bad this brilliance will be buried. 
LMAO. Yeah. My B.
Try streaming it through your cable providers website. Someone said that works better than ESPNs website.
The main ESPN stream sucks. But try the hometown radio feed.

Feel like Bama would be better with Tua
Beautiful pass!
Bama playing to lose tonight!
Yes 
L I T T L E B R O T H E R ITTLEBROTHER
The mouse won't go bankrupt anytime soon. It's expanding and going to bring this incredibly reliable and quality service to non cable subscribers. 
Amazing how you can move the ball with a QB who can throw. Take some notes, Bama. 
Happens online all the time, including /r/NBA.
I can't read that, it shows as *******
Calvin and Cavin. I hope their next kid is Cvin
I just noticed the word "Atlanta" is slightly off center at midfield, and I can't unsee it. 
If Georgia keeps their heads on, don't see how they couldn't pull this one out. One of a few teams that can meet Bamer talent wise.
A touchdown here would be so big.  I love our D vs their O right now.
True if big 
Soft soft satin. 
Bad play call, anything that takes that long to develop will go nowhere against Alabama
IS IT NOT ALREADY?
UGA just went all “I''m your huckleberry” on them. 
Will his NFL jersey read "Calvin Ridley's Brother?"
I forget what they look like sometimes
Commercials lasted 2:32. So this game is a little less than half ads
Fromm is impressive as heck right now, the poise this freshman has is unreal
If Alabama loses this game, they'll be no better in my mind than Syracuse 
Not available with my package
For the first time in history of college football, Georgia is playing Alabama in 2018
This drive is uniqua
Saquon Barkley on the carry! Wait...
who gives a fuck about brothers
Pass rush isn't getting to Fromm. Ruruh, Scooby.
The main ESPN stream sucks. But try the hometown radio feed.

You MONSTER!!
I actually did not
But.. if they''re college cheerleaders, they''re of legal age. 
Bamas marching band looks like they want Dixie to rise again
Ford is playing 16d chess and paying for those commercials.
Dish Network i assume?
> When are they gonna realize that over-commercialization is a bad thing.If a tenth of the people who complained about it actually turned the game off, they might consider it.
Are they really brothers?
How is it that video game streams are more reliable than fuckin EPSN. 
Really, say it 18 more times so it sinks in
Your own brother is shitting on your team my dude
Someone please explain to me what the line was doing there. The QB had time and did not get hit. How came Texas did not do that this year?
UCF would be up 14-0;)
You'd think I would have heard that somewhere.
Calvinball must be awesome 
And Georgia is saying I'm your huckleberry....
The whole "effort" segment with Cutcliffe and Fitzgerald was awesome.
WATCHESPN'S CODE WAS WRITTEN BY UNIVERSITY OF IOWA GRADUATES. TRY ESPN'S DATA CENTER STREAM: http://www.espn.com/watch/player?bucketId=2&id=3265225
The Empire did nothing wrong 
I am so unhappy. 
How many games of NCAA football 14 do you think I can play between now and Kendrick?
Is Georgia a second half team? 
lol is he still a thing
HEY GUYS WHATS THIS THING THW TEAMS ARE DOING TO KEEP THE OTHERS FROM SCORING??
Riley Ridley stepping up. Been waiting for this all season.
@
IDC about the brothers. It's not that interesting
Man any RB has to feel super beat up after a game against Bama
Have they shown any split-jerseyed Ridley family members?
Wow they just called the dome cheap... 
where is the Alabama defense I saw in the Sugar Bowl? THAT team was playing out of their minds. 
BUT DID YOU KNOW THAT KIRBY SMART USED TO COACH FOR ALABAMA? LET US TELL YOU AGAIN.
Part of that is the use of the RB & TE in protection.
It says Jimbo is supposed to be there too on the ticker. Maybe taking a break? 
So we're gonna have to rely on Hurts' arm today.Oh jesus.
Satisfying how it was just out of reach of that defender he threw it over. 
I would pay good money to put Tua in.
I miss Jennings
If only we had a defense half as good as either of these two...
I've come to the conclusion that they only offer the app for the illusion of streaming.
thank you for this
Theyre going that way
This is some god damn bullshit ESPN. Watch ESPN is unwatchable. 
solid run to make it a mangeable 3rd down   
Anyone else wondering if they've broken jaylen because they are trying to work on his game? I don't know what it is, but he's just broken and not what he was last year. 
To be fair none of this has been Calvin''s fault. 
GO TO YOUR CORNER
Georgia QB is legit
Watching our defense slowly die while the offense shits the bed. I said GA by 14pnts and got ripped in r/rolltide.
Swift is a true freshman right? And they have James Cook coming in next year. Run game gonna be as OP as this year
Shit
1 down away from commercials. woohoo.
Fuck my shit up fam
If I''ve learned one thing so far watching this game, it''s at the watch ESPN app is terrible
Depends on quarter length. 
Theyre a classic team, good colors, some interesting players over the past couple years. You should go see a game at Beaver if you get a chance. Loved the football atmosphere of both schools. 
ESPN: Fromm commanded the US army during Desert Storm when he was 6
Fromm!
Georgie knows da wae 
Riley > Calvin 
Well the bad announcing at least makes the ncaa 14 game realistic 
Got a pic? 
lmao
Oh.Well then fuck that guy.Figuratively.
We're winning right now with our offense and TOP
Depending on quarter length, as many as you want pal
Ridley I and Ridley II would be sweet jerseys
Thunder fans and Westbrook himself. 
he da real MVP. 
Nope, wish the announcers would let us know
I'm so drunk I look like David Hasselhoff eating a cheeseburger only with popcorn
https://i.imgur.com/cd1bZvg.jpg
Amen man. You should hear our director rant about stuff like this, and Temple doesn't even get that many televised games lol
They have been alot
Really not that close.  NCAA is like 25-30 million.  Super Bowl is around 100 million now if not more
CATCH MAN
REEHEEHEE RINGER IN MY RUTT
@/u/ImXavierrYou right though.
Bama defense going to get tired. 
I crei.
Just realized something... and I really don't want to celebrate Alabama.... I really don't...But I like these finals because it finally slaps all the SEC haters in the mouth who have to shitpost week in and out about "but muh conference, but muh exposure, bluh"
Take my money that's the only way I'll be able to make my school's football team any good.
is 6-0 an insurmountable lead? can bama get 3 safeties in the 2nd half to tie it up?
Just when I'm about to type "nice" I hear the UGA band play "and to hell with Georgia tech." Boo! Boo! Boo!
what a pass and catch!
Makes me wish OSU made the playoffs. We would've killed Clemson lol
That catch doe
^fuck
Great pass
They're getting their moneys worth
Holy shit what a throw and catch 
Have an upboat for waiting
WE ARE RESPECTING WOMEN 
HUH, I HAVEN'T HAD ANY PROBLEMS AT ALL. SORRY MAN!
what a fucking throw
Is the Georgia band playing the intro to Big Balls by AC/DC?
Mossed son 
Damn good throw 
Ok just making sure I was seeing the right thing.
They were in the Rose Bowl...
DON''T LET HIM HELP YOU UP WIMS
Future heisman material?
Who are both of these quarterbacks and why are neither of them Sam Darnold?
Wims redeemed
He touched the ref!!! Boot him from the game
What are you talking about? Satan is still coaching ‘Bama and Eason is throwing well tonight!
I didn't win HQ tonight, so now GA has to win so I feel better
Riley is a 21 year old Soph and Calvin is a 23 year old Junior and it doesn't look like either red-shirted. Kinda weird but I guess it doesn't matter.
Has anyone figured out how to hide the control bar on ESPN''s turd of a web player?
Hot take.
Hobbs?
There you go Wims get some 
Dang, Georgia lookin' good!!!
Fuuuuuck you
No matter what, the Ridley family has natty. Great players, the both of them. 
Georgia, you scary.
B1G Refs ftw!
Interference. LOL
Yes sir. 
We have no defense on 3rd.
Hell yeah, Dawgs!
WOOT WOOT!
What is Fromm's favorite route? I don't think you've told me enough
Ejection!! Initiated contact with an official. 
Better than Equanimious and Amon-Ra and Osiris
Amazing catch
I mean, their ratings and views have allegedly been dropping quite a lot recently so...
B1G refs help people up no problem...
Is this the first time in 10 (?) years Alabama hasn't had an amazing ILB? This half feels like it would be way different with Reuben or CJ in there.
I guess you could call it UnwatchableESPN
What the fuck, they've ran the clock on two out of bounds plays now. Gotta make room for commercials and keep it under 4 hrs!
 S L A N T S O N L Y
Fromm Browns 2020 confirmed 
Appreciate that kind of dedication!
damn what a catch
It''s time for the Bama Order....to end. -Skywalker probably 
This Lebatard show megacast is fucking amazing
Fromm next Luck confirmed? 
FrOmM cAn''T tHrOw!
Careful Wims don''t slap the line judge''s hand away.
"fuck these commercials!  Long drive time!"
Bama dynasty over

Nice catch
If anyone ever asks me what fromm's favorite route it...trust me i'll know atp
What a catch!
WOW!
Great hand and footwork 
SNAP THE BAWL DAWGS
Wow thought for sure he was out
He was definitely in..
Wims showed up
I''ll do Orisa if no one goes tank and there''s a Mercy. I hardly ever get to play Reaper, who I''ve been maining lately.Do you play comp?
Such a great matchup. Who you got ... Jake Fromm State Farm or one hurty boi?
Fuck reminiscing on the Auburn game where we couldn''t get off the field on 3rd down. Help 
Michigan fans also be like "Can Shea do that please?"
I'll start a game of NCAA 05 on my laptop using the Dolphin emulator and keep y'all updated
Georgia WR making sure he doesn't get ejected by letting the ref help him up. Smart move.
Hey did you all know that Matthew Stafford and Clayton Kershaw played baseball together in school?
Wooow thought that he didn''t get a foot down. Looked good tho 
I keep it to 5
THERE IS NO NEED FOR A REVIEW
Is it time to review a play?  Commercial!
SNAP THE FUCKING BALL
Why did you take so long to snap it???
That ducking Renior question
Fucking review everything 
And commercial time 
Stevan ridley is their uncle. I just made that up.
That''s a catch 
Review so we can go to commercial
Fromm to Wims on the back shoulder passfuck I wish Wims wasn't a senior...
What the hell is this football shit? Where are the commercials?
This is so boring 
Here comes a commercial
Jesus that was nice
I tell you what, that was one of those plays you call on a Wims. 
Damn, no need to review that. These guys are playing to win!
10 points might be enough
HOORAY MORE COMMERCIALS
Only 9 more minutes of football and 47 more minutes of commercials until Kendrick Lamar! 
I like how we a running Swift more, keeping Chubb and Michel fresh for later in the game.
The best way to keep a team from scoring is to not let them score.
Go grab one of the feeds. You tried to do it the right way.
Darnold has both of these teams right where he wants them
WHY REVIEW OBVIOUS CALLS
would have landed out if his legs didn't get tangled with the defender.
Incoming commercials
corner saved him by tying up that leg lol
Wait wait review it for commercials
Time for another commercial
A review? Time for a commercial!
They must be new at this.
Shit you could probably fit in a Road to Glory
Commercialssssssssss
He touched the ref when the ref helped him up! Eject him!!!
The play under review
Can we see the replay please??
Please let this game be tied at the end of the fourth. That's all I want. 
Bama will hire Hugh Freeze at halftime
Sorta not really. Hit and miss for me, though the commercials come through just fine. 
They say the truth hurts and sometimes needs to be said :-(
I just want everyone to know that I was at Jordan-Hare for the Iron Bowl this year. And I remember as the Bama fans were leaving early, I shouted to them “BETTER LUCK NEXT YEAR”. Boy, do I regret saying that now
Commercial review
Backshoulder Wims^TM
No catch. Bobble while laying out of bounds. ESPN is clueless. 
Shit, me neither fucking Jean Renoir
If we can''t stop them on 3rd down, we will lose. It''s that simple. 
Two awful reviews. 
DRINK
Great catch kid!!
Anyone else watching the command center stream and seeing the guy follow Saban around with the cup of water lmao
Back shoulder fade! Drink!
WE'LL TAKE A BREAK
Gg Bama?
OH FFS REVIEW = COMMERCIALS
Again, I am just glad that our D gets to chill for a while.
These reviews are momentum killers
I have no idea how I have access to the skycam on ESPN, but I'm not complaining. 
Should have just snapped the ball.
Guess we got to much football that time.
Yay! Commercials
Fuck a break
Refs conspiring for more commercials 
I JUST WANT TO SAY I AM WATCHING THE GAME BUT IM NOT ENJOYING IT
Yes!!! More commercials!!!!!! 
W I M S
What a fucking catch 
why the fuck would you not snap the ball faster
IN
Gotta get that review so we can watch more goddamn commercials.
WHAT A CATCH 
Gonna be a catch tho
Fuck this shit. More commercials incoming.
What? I said my dude!
Gotta get more commercials in, for no damn reason.
My son started whining on that completion, the 7 month old has spoken...that he is a baby and doesnt have  any useful opinions  on the game
IT'S CLEARLY A CATCH WHY THE FUCK ARE YOU REVIEWING IT
I get this odd feeling that the "review" is for commercial purposes. 
They sustained a couple more injuries
They back fam
I wouldn''t even be mad 
HQ IS ASS
Refs are getting paid to cause commercial breaks
This game is driving me crazy, and the commercials aren't helping.
[deleted]
Nope, they'll review it for more commercials.
> We''ll take a breakFuck you
That was such an easy call why the fuck are you reviewing this???
I swear they do the reviews just so they can have more commercials 
"review that so we can get more commercials in"
"Flag on the refs, not enough commercial opportunities" - review booth
Take a break everyone. It''s been 5 minutes since the last one.
[deleted]
Someone earlier suggested that these reviews are intentional to maximize commercial breaks. This one seems like a prime candidate.
Shot time boys!
That's bullshit kills the tempo. A clear fucking catch
These fucking reviews
5 minute commercial break to review this.
"We haven't played ads in over a minute. Quick, review a play!"
OH SHIT VERY NICE
"The ruling on the field is that ESPN wants more commercials"
INJECT THE COMMERCIAL INTO MY VEINS 
A review just to show more commercials. 
Under review for further commercials
He's in bounds but he got away with a push
First play: Left middle openSecond Play: Overcoverage in the middle costs Bama pointsIs Saban getting outcoached rn? Is it just me?
COMMERCIALS
WHY CAN WE NOT WATCH THE FUCKING REVIEW.
JFC this game will be on until the 2018 season starts 
Fuck you ESPN
what a laser by Fromm, that was sexy, great catch too
Let's perform another pointless review.
"The ruling on the field is we've gone too long without a commercial"
Lmao, this is so fucking pathetic, this defense is trash when it plays a team that has a half decent QB.
Yay more commercials
Saban should take notes. This is what a football team looks like when you have a quarterback that can actually throw and move the ball downfield. 
But commercials 
Because he wouldn't have it any other way
It's inBut I'm bias so.. lol
Thank you
This review is just an excuse for more commercials...
They just wanted more commercials
Kirby''s offensive play calling is absolutely brilliant. Execution isn''t there every time but the calls are perfect. Keeping the Bama defense on their heels. 
WHO''S THAT COMIN DOWN THE TRACK
ESPN wanted that review more than the refs.
In the NFL I'm pretty sure it would be ruled incompleteEdit: even with both feet. They love calling back those bobbles
I wondered why he had a desert Strom trading card 
WE'LL TAKE A BREAK I hate ESPN so much. such a shitty network
Hey it's a close catch let's go ahead and take all day to snap the ball. Never fucking get why teams always do this 
Gotta get those BS reviews in so that ad money flows 
Wims out here going full Mike Williams on us
As long as Hurts is under center.
Gotta review that so we can pump out more commercials. holy fuuuckkk REEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
NOOOO! TOO MANY COMMERCIALS 
Lol reviewing just for the sake of reviewing. This kills the Dawgs momentum.
We seriously need a commercial for this????
Lol
I like Fromm just as much as anyone, but can the announcers please stop just sucking him off with commentary.Well I guess they don't Darnold or JT Barrett....
Obvious catch. Definitely review it. SMH
High football IQ there
He wouldn't have it any other way.
We want to be sure, and we can make more money
I wouldn''t say over. Just that the Georgia dynasty is just starting. Alabama is also a young team.
ESPN: hey review that so we show more commercials!
What a fucking catch
Yes! Another commercial.  And it was catch.
Holy shit so many commercials
Great catch 
Wait guys, what's that (-1) number mean?
Yeah ask Kentucky about that :\
ESPN telling the refs they need more commercials
Nooooooooooooooooooo not another break
I remember when Sony Michel's high school tape came out and I literally thought he was playing 4 year olds and now here we are god damn time flies
We need X files music when the head official comes in
Georgia you need to hurry the fuck up there
PLEASE. GIVE US A BREAK FROM THESE BREAKS!!
They just want more commercials. Fucking hell 
Of course they're going to comm--You know what, I'm just gonna make use of the mute button from now on.
Enough breaks this is crazy...
He tried to pull him OOB, lol.
You're going to commercial during a quick review! !!!!!!?????!!!
I chose to believe this game is 10-3 and bama scored when they should have 
Go DAWGS!!!!
Fuck, here we go. 
Unwatchable 
Why do they always wait until the very last possible second?!
BEAUTIFUL
Wow
Our LBs spent most of the year injured, so never really had a chance for one to step up into that role.
I know a guy named Cavan. It's not that unique.
ADVERTISING REVENUE
When is it not?
Need more commercials. 
Gotta sell some insurance 
I do. But I'm mid gold after a season off and I'm on PS4.
Riley Ridley wears 8. Calvin Ridley wears 3. They are 2 brothers. The game is being played in Atlanta. 2, 8, 3. The Atlanta Falcons blew a 28-3 lead.
The CFP music is epic af 
3 plays without a commercial, better review that catch
How long are they going to do this "Homers" garbage. It's super distracting. 
He bobbled it. 
GRRRRRR......
Is Dan Aykroyd refereeing this game?
"We'll take a break"OH YOU DONT FUCKING SAY
Are the not officials in the booth watching replays? Why do we have to review this. HURRY UP TEMPO TEMPO 
OH. MY. GOD.Just as there was some fluid football going, *someone* decides we need more commercials.Fuck that. They know it's a catch.
This is almost unwatchable 
Think that was the longest break without commercials so far. Aaaaand it's gone.
Commercials!!!!!!
Well they score a TD on D every game so you have to score at least 8 to beat them.
MOAR COMMERCIALS
hot take
That's a big ol' confirmation, good buddy.
FUUUUUUUUUUUUUIUCK
We were wrong all season about who paid off the refs. It was ESPN the whole time.
Wims knows to let the ref help you up.
Want to see replay. Looked like an obvious movement of the ball at end
For more commercials obviously.
Nooooo 
Bama can't get off the field on third down jeez
Brian Daboll is crippling this team. I've been the biggest Jalen supporter all year and still believe in him, but he's shown no improvement from freshman to sophomore year. That's all Daboll's fault, not Jalen's.
Refs should not be helping players up.
Daisy Ridley is their sister
Georgia could be up 28-0 and id still be scared Alabama will win. 
That was a nice catch
Holy shit....they did that just to show more crap
Thankful for the commercial b/c I couldn't remember if people were impressed by the new Chevys or not
Called it. Any opportunity for another commercial. and it kills the drive momentum. Free time out
Georgia marching
I just kept getting an error when I tried to watch. Had to switch to dish anywhere 
Be careful calling teams “Little Brother”. Ask a Michigan fan. They''ll tell you why lol.
ref ruling more commericals
I too enjoy the teleportation route
 More commercials.
The refs are working with ESPN, I swear to god that was clear as hell they just want more fucking commercials 
Let's go Georgia!
Remember when our kicker fucking sucks?
reviewed just for more commercials...
ESPN is challenging the lack of ads on that play.
I feel like they lowkey reviewed the play just as an excuse to air more commercials...
I love to shit on ESPN as much as the next guy, but all the different ways they provide to watch the NCG is fucking awesome
Sure let's just kill our momentum by reviewing a play that was fairly clear and going to commercial!
Cheeky punch to the head 
Ugh! They had to review it.... and commercials. 
Damn Georgia has a lot of young talent. I didn't realize Riley was Sophomore. Regardless of this game they look set for a while
Outstanding catch.
As an Alabama fan, it's game over. GG
Thanks Ohio State? 
Jalen hurts is mediocre don''t @ me
They need to stop reviewing obvious calls 
Obvious catch being reviewed just for more commercials 
Feeling great with my uga and the points pick 
Too many consecutive plays, ESPN called in a review 
The ruling on the field is that our sponsors need another commercial.  
They know NFL viewers are watching this, so they're trying to provide an authentic experience with this review.
Reviewing every play equals 5 hour games 
My thoughts EXACTLY 
Rat Poison. 
Damn cfb refs seem way better than nfl refs
My cat wants in from the cold, yet he always climbs on me when I''m trying to watch the game. Should I let him in? 
actually getting hyped boxscore watching
It's one of those factoids that elicits an unenthusiastic "huh" from me
Conspiracy= excess booth reviews to squeeze more commercials in 
"Quick! Needlessly review it so we can get more commercials in!"
I can't wait for ESPN to finally die, fuck them
COMMERCIALS!
They're doing this shit on purpose to show more commercials 
They're only calling the review just so they can cram in more commercials.
If Georgia keeps scoring more points than Alabama, it doesn''t look good for Alabama 
Did he bobble at the end? Too bad espn is too greedy to show more replays 
New drinking game, a shot for every commercial break
fuck these reviews on obvious calls its an excuse to show more commercials
Just in case we haven''t seen the new Chevy commercial 
Can't miss an opportunity to stick in 10 more commercials
Why are they reviewing it? Because it's close enough and a pretty important play and it's the national championship game.
Advertisers must fucking love replay reviews
Let's watch commercials again...FUCK 
These reviews HAVE to just be an excuse to have more commercials
This game won't be done until fucking midnight 
WOOF WOOF WOOF WOOF WOOF WOOF 
I''m so hyped for Kendrick Lamar 
Another review... 
3rd down defense is double plus ungood.
Psssssstttttt, hey ref, we need some more commercials, review the play so we can play some commercials.....
So far I clocked 12 minutes of total commercials in the first half and I am currently closing in on 10 minutes of comercials in the second half 
IN!
Overs win. The number was 8.
Reviews are just commercial abuse. That's a ten second look Max to confirm.
lets review these commericals
Im thoroughly convinced that these "reviews" are being planned just for commercials. 
Damn they better not take that away. Don't be like the NFL where you nit pick every damn thing. Dude makes the catch and is down before ball is moving.
ESPN'S NIGHT OF TOO MANY COMMERCIALS
ESPN calls review of play in lieu of commercials 
these aren't PAC refs, thankfully 
Kirby doesn't call offensive plays.
Like by scoring more?
I don''t want to jinx it, but hats off to the B1G officials. They are calling the game right, but it appears that they “aren''t present” in the sense of they are letting the game play without overdoing it, but aren''t making bad calls. They''ve been pretty on point thus far. 
ESPN TO refs: hey we need another commercial break can you review a call please?
Are we actually having commercials during a review!? Lmao this is a new low
How about making bama use some challenges
This trivia round is about top 8 songs from various years past as it is Jan 8th. This is even more infuriating as I'm a metal head and I think all of these songs are not pleasing to my ears.
How is the team who dismantled the mighty Mercer struggling so much?
So getting a hand down when going out of bounds counts, but when you're in the middle of the field you can put a hand down for balance and not be ruled down? I understand he's in with the foot and elbow as well, but that seems odd to me. 
Review during season: stay with the game. Review in CHAMPIONSHIP GAME: cut away to commercial 
The ball did come out at the end though. I'm not sure how much that counts to college but in the NFL that's considered a dropped pass 
God dammit.
football interrupting my commercials
HQ is the most depressing daily ritual. Second most is rooting for my college football teams.
Alabama gonna have a tough time if Georgia keeps hogging the ball like this. They're winning the ToP battle 2:1
So, what's it like having a qb at qb?
That''s no good on sundays. Didn''t get it notorized. 
But the ball came out when he hit the ground so its not a cat... oh wait this isnt the dumbass NFL rules neat
he bobbled it a bit when he hit the ground 
Yeah but COMMERCIALS
I like you.
But when will we watch commercials. 
How are we supposed to maintain any fucking momentum on offense when they call time on fucking everything. The ref was RIGHT THERE 
mfw i am espn and there's a quasi-reviewable play :)
He's clearly in, but we sold a shitload of commercials.  Ahem, I mean the play is under review.
That was close, we almost went 2 minutes without ads.
Mayhem is back. WOOOO!!! GO STATE!!!
I thought I was having internet issues. The stream on the espn app actually sucking for others? 
Like the joke, and both are good, but having a competent passing QB is the huge difference.
Commercials. 
**my liver:** fade me fam
true freshman out here running the offense out of multiple formations, making throws between the hash markshmmmmmmmmmm
I almost think the only way Bama wins this is if Tua is put in so that a couple of passes can be completed.
It''s just called two brothers hahahaha 
More Allstate commercials.
> Chaney's
*Clearly lands inbounds**Officials buzz down for a review**ESPN has commercial orgasm*
*We gotta get a few more in so ESPN  meets their financials***THE PREVIOUS PLAY IS UNDER FURTHER REVIEW**
this game isn't ending until 1 and I have an 8 AM class rip 
We need more commercials. 
i'm pissed about that review cause now we have to watch fucking commercials
for fucks sake
"HEY! DON'T TOUCH ME! DON'T TOUCH ME!!"
review my ass
The ball moved. But who knows what a catch is anymore
So that they can put in more ads
He threw that ball like he was TP'ing a house on Halloween!
I agree. I have watched several Alabama games this season, and I have never been impressed with Jalen Hurts.
Oh man if Georgia shuts out Bama, this might be better than anything on Pornhub.
The NCAA needs to get reviews under control. This is gonna be an outrageous 5 minutes to decide this obvious cal. 
Yeahhh he''s mayhem guy again
Impressive QB play from a true freshman
Delet ths
Fromm is going to win the Heisman in 2 years. I'm calling it. Also calling NFL MVP in 7 years. You heard it here first.
HERE IT COMES THE COMMERCIALS
[removed]
"Think a drive will stave off the commercials? I DONT THINK SO" espn
"We'll take a break"
bc commercials.
Yes. That''s obvious.
We do, the first two strings are hurt
get this touchdown Dawgs,  no settling for 3, put the pressure on bama
Oh wait, you only need *one* foot down instead of two, right? (NFL watcher here)
Oh shit, plot twist\#TeamMayhem
He''s in
FOX, not ESPN, is the network who sucks Barrett off
That shitty moment when you see true freshman Fromm make an adjustment at the line when the great Gus Malzohn hasn't let a QB ever audible. 
“We want to be sure we can get this right” = “we want to be sure there are as many commercials as possible”.
He's worse than that
Looks like Ca**l**vin may take the L versus Cavin Ridley.
ESPN - call a review so we can put in more commmeeeeerrrrrcials
Come on Georgia get up there and snap the ball that's a close call on the sideline.
The momentum of this game is being completely ruined by ESPN 
Fuck this
You know what I miss Ryan O'Reilly?  You not being on my TV every 2 minutes.
i fucking got that john renoir question right and it didnt register cause of a glitch, would have been an insane savage question
Well, let's be honest.  He was a terrible passer last year, too.  He is terribly one dimensional.  
remember last week's second half?
Am I the only one that saw him lose the ball when he landed?
Football is a delicacy. We need the review because if you experience too much football too often you won't appreciate it as much. we need a moment to cleanse the palate before the next play
Looks like targeting to me. 
When you stop posting on the reddit game thread during the game, the commercial breaks don''t seem as frequent. 
Called the review just to get more commercials in.
Brother made a good point after he hits the ground the ball slides up his forearm
No it's for the commercials 
Yes
I absolutely fucking loathe the flow of this game. 
Are aliens invading the game or something damn
I think they're looking at whether he had control of the ball. He was down on the ground when the defender knock it a little loose, should be a catch.
So glad the NFL doesn't do this shiiiiit.
Do fingertips count like a toe?Also, does that loss of control when the Alabama player takes a swipe at it factor in? I don''t think it would, with him having completed the catch in my mind at that point, but idk what a catch is anymore 
Refs mic sounds like some kind of laser gun out of a 1950's monster movie.
The ball comes out after he lands, but only after the Bama player hit the ball. It will probably stand since he survived the ground, but then it got knocked out by an incident after the impact with the ground.
Dude, it's been like, 10 plays without a commercial. It wouldn't have mattered if that was a RB iso up the middle. Shit was getting reviewed.
Yes you monster 
Fromm way better than Hurts so far  
If you need a good laugh here's a parody of Chevy's "Real People" commercialshttps://youtu.be/xTfS0nAgfuE
Yea the dawgs are gonna take this one. They have all the momentum and are making all the plays 
How does the lack of a tennis ball mean you run into the wall...
Thank you.
If you hustle, depending on commercials, 4-6
Mayhem is officially back, we get it—now put the fuckin game on. 
I dont watch too much college ball. Why have there been 2 calls reviewed without a challenge from Saban? Just different procedure in college I''m assuming?
If he doesn't climb on you while you watch commercials, then you'll be fine.
These reviews are getting ridiculous
Mayhem is back
We need more commercials!! Review it!!!
You''re being too generous. 
Excellent 
[When Fowler says we'll take a quick break](https://media.giphy.com/media/GV3aYiEP8qbao/giphy.gif)
Officials trying to drag the game as much s possible lol
STOP THE GAME! STOP THE GAME! THERE'S A CLOSE ENOUGH PLAY WE CAN FIT SOME COMMERCIALS IN THERE!
Bama's defense is going to get worn down like it did against Clemson last year.  They are spending way too much time out there on the field.
What the hell a commercial?!? 
That Jean Renoir question was savage
Yeah. I didnt think he was inbounds but replay shows he was. Good call.
What a waste of time. No we don't want to watch the end of the game on the east coast. Keep wasting our time please.
He was down and then the Bama player tried to rip it out. He caused the bobble not the ground. Catch
"the ruling on the field was a rush for 1 yard. that ruling is under review." *COMMERCIALS*
$$$$$$$$$
MAYHEM BACK 
If they go to commercials I swearEdit: whaaaaaaaa!!!!!
The ball kinda moves at the end, is that enough to change the ruling? Was a sick catch though 
This Allstate commercial reminds me of a Logan paul video.
Does anyone remember an lsu bama game in like 2008 when Patrick Peterson was denied a game sealing interception on the sideline bc, even though his foot was in, he was touching Julio Jones who was out of bounds thus they ruled it incomplete?The same should apply here no?
Ive only ever seen the Mayhem actor in one movie.  John Wick.
Reviews = $$$
Looks like he might have lost it when he landed
SAME
If we're lucky 
This is the definition of an anecdotal argument 
I guess I am the only one who saw the ball moving around when he was out of bounds...
Yes.
This is like a twitch chat. So many comments that nobody is even reading them. We just throwing our words out there in the hopes that someone cares lol. 
Did anyone else hear the UFO hovering over the stadium
Wait I always thought that was an insult to italian people that party and stuff at jersey shore, kind of like guido, is this not what it is?
If we manage to take a double digit lead into the half too? Yes please.
That''s a good question.
Bruh ESPN just reviewed it, it's a catcha very clutch catch
Don''t you love commercials
This ref sounds just like dan aykroyd
They have to get this right. 
This kills the Bama.
Not a question of quality, but closeness to Calvin.
Honestly I'd prefer commercials over Lamar
Let him freeze
Conference shit post about people shitposting about conferences. Nice job.
Lol since when do booth reviews include commercial breaks?
Looked good on that view before an hour of commercials. The suspense is killing me.
I couldn't believe that it was a catch first time seeing that, but I think Averett's calf saved it.
Well duh 15 commercials
I didn't know CBS was broadcasting the game 
I knew they were setting those up for something. 
Allstate pulling the long con.
We''re not allowed to watch replays. Only commercials.
lol I feel ya! It hurts the bands tremendously, and it's only a cheap fix. There were several times this season when we didn't even have time to cadence onto the field; just sprint on. 
20 bucks says they start reviewing field goals so that we can get commercial breaks.
MAYHEM IS BACK
Correct, only one foot needed
finally a commercial break. 5 minutes i can do anything i want!!!
These reviews are killing the pace of the game... but at least they're giving our defense a breather because our offense sure as shit can't stay out on the field. 
Damn, I thought Mayham we returning for SB. 
But Georgia ain''t played nobody Pawwwwwwl
[Every college coach tweeting that Georgia must run the ball](https://twitter.com/TCUCoachP/status/950544263036719104), meanwhile Fromm's just tossing his way into Bama's red zone. 
Thanks ref for killing our up tempo offense with another unnecessary review... 
IIRC another team from Georgia gave up a similar lead during a championship football game last year. Happened within the last quarter too.
Oh Mayhem is BACK????? #WHAT A SURPRISE!!!
We were getting too much game time in, so more commercials 
Is this what could've been if we had a good QB in the 2011 NCG? Reopening old wounds here for me :(
Did the fucking broadcaster radio the Ref saying “WE NEED MORE COMMERCIALS! REVIEW THE PLAY!”
The prophecy is true
I hate you but a memes a meme. Upvote
They don't have to look as close for stuff like both feet down
Nice. Frustrating sometimes. But nice. 
No catch. He bobbled the ball out of bounds. 
Can we get a commercial break flair?
Mayhem turned evil again
It was hit out while he was on the ground already 
word bro
The ruling on the field is that we've had enough damn commercials. That ruling is under review.
They're only challenging that play to make room for more commercials. Everyone knows it. 
Ref brought his theramin to the championship game
And... We'll take a break
[deleted]
Your class gets together and wakes and bakes? Crazy kids
Allstate has the only decent commercial 
"Okay, we're going to take a break break"
Man up
Wait, where does the whole 10 come from? They''ve only gotten in FG range once, right?
Holy shit how is anyone reading these comments. It''s like 15 a second 
Fromm is scary calm and good. 
I mean.... its only 3-0...
Honestly these commercials are making me think football would be the worst sport to watch if you had no interest in the game 
Fellow Georgia fans take a moment to appreciate Wims, please.Nobody talks about my boy, he is a playmaker. 
They're getting a ton of breathers with commercials
Our offense has to do something
You's a bitch now Mayhem
Mayhem's back! Yay mayhem!
You know they called in so they could get more commercials 
There''s a porn for that. 
Flair up before shit talking. 
[YOU KNOW WHAT YOU DID](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/g3R9OAOOAaM/maxresdefault.jpg)
Shut him in another room.
I CALLED IT during the Rose Bowl that Mayhem would crack during the NCG
Why the hell don't teams hurry up and snap the ball on close plays? It's like they're inviting a challenge. 
> Ackryoid Uhhhhh, no?Dan Capron. Workers comp attorney in Chicago.Also, [Flair up or shut up my dude!](https://flair.redditcfb.com/)
FR
Im beginning to think these reviews are intentional so they can play more commercials.
Jake Fromm is changing protections and plays at the line vs Alabama in the natl title game and he was playing high school football last year. That's insane 
This is the second needless review of the night. 
Shut the fuck up, Jon Hamm
True Freshman QB making changes at the line...crazy 
Ball came loose. Great review
Yes, it should stand as called
Yeah Idk for sure but imagine any part of the hand, counts as “in.”
Eventually ESPNs gonna figure out that whole rule of entertainment about not wasting the viewers time.
And we're back in commercial. Such a boring game so far
I like how an entire ESPN crew can''t notice the play is at LEAST questionable
The reviews have been on Georgia for starters
Hurts inability to throw is going to cost Bama the natty once again 
Fuck ESPN
Ball got knocked loose, but did he have possession long enough? Who knows 
WHAT TIME IS IT?COMMERCIAL TIME 
I know! That's amazing to me. 
Goddamn Imma pray for you.
God I miss Verne. Even with the messed up names. That was just extra entertainment. 
Ref: “This was clearly a catch, but we''d like to take the opportunity to fit in 4 more commercials.”“After Allstate commercial review, the ruling on the field is confirmed.”
Sorry, network says we need another commercial break so we're reviewing this catch.  
Does anyone else not see he bobbled the ball after coming down? Doesn't fucking matter his foot and hand were in bounds. I feel like I'm taking crazy pills... Announcers are clueless and I came here assuming you people would notice. 
Correct.
Reviewing plays just for more commercials at this point
 Correct 
The Allstate mayhem guy is behind all these commercials.
WE NEED TO GET JALEN OUT, Georgia is getting more offensive drives THAN WE ARE! WE CANT PASS THE BALL.
*THIS CALL IS UNDER FURTHER REVIEW*TIME FOR MORE COMMERCIALS!
good point 
*tips fedora*
NFL maybe that''s not a catch. I''m not sure if it survived the ground.
He was decent in Brooklyn Nine-Nine
I don''t want no mayhem. I WANT CHAOS
I dunno about this. He had a hand down, but he juggled it out of bounds. I think it is an incomplete pass.
Mayhem is back on the menu boys
Minkah is blitzing a lot 
These commercial breaks tho. Come on man. 
Shit, it could be that score with 1 minute remaining I would be scared. The natural state of the Georgia fan is to be nervous for at least an hour after the game.
He also plays the vulture in Brooklyn 99
We also have the #1 recruiting class (so far) coming in.
Even the coaches in the film room complained about the commercials
what a fucking catch 
Damn, this thread is live. Comments end up half way down the page.
It must be nice to have a qb 
I can't believe I'm saying this but...go Bama. UGA keeps taking all the croots.
Don''t say that remember last week with Oklahoma 
Great awareness to keep that left foot in the air before getting a hand and a foot in 
Welcome back Mayhem! 
So are we just reviewing shit so there's more commercial time?
I can't imagine how awesome this game would be if the teams were allowed to actually play without media timeouts. 
Once again, the main stream on ESPN is completely unwatchable on watchespn. Absolutely ridiculous. 
Fuck espn
Mayhem is backAll is right in the world
I think B1G refs were at the Rose Bowl, and it was the same way.
Aliens known as "corporate America"
drink a verification can to continue watching 
ESPN trying to milk the end of the season for all it's worth
[GPOY watching this](https://m.imgur.com/nkqOEPs) 
Amazing athlete, average QB. 
Not in college 1 foot is all you need. Or In this case the hand first. 
So stupid.Georgia tries to go fast and they slow down the game. At least make it a coach challenge
Film Room on ESPNEWS with the HCs is fuckin lit.
Fuck ESPN
It's hard to watch even if you have interest
[Flair up or shut up my dude!](https://flair.redditcfb.com/)
So, still an authentic NFL TV experience.
Yes only one. That being said, he got a hand and a foot down which I believe would also count in the NFL. THAT being said, I think he lost the ball when he landed but that's just me.
Yep one. And you don''t have to be touched to be down. 
JON HAMM IS A GIFT FROM GOD
Damn bro yeah happened to be earlier in the day
They probably just google your name and dark web. Charge old people who still don''t understand what QWERTY means with respect to a computer
If you get a hand and a foot down in the NFL, is it a catch?
Mayhem is back!
It's the only part of the stream that doesnt buffer every 3 seconds.
Don''t go. You can burn an absence
First half sure, but anything can change in the 2nd half
lost it while in the process of going to the ground out of boundsshould be incomplete
to many fucking commercial yo 
And the fuck is someone going to do with your email address but no password?Send you a spooky email?
I care bb. 
Subscribe
Fuck ESPN
Instead of laughing at the ridiculous superstition that walking under a rather uninspiring arch will keep you from graduating. Would you like me to insult the sub-par education the institution provides instead?
So does it matter he its touching a player that touches OB before he makes contact in bounds?  Looked like he did but not sure of the rule.
I'd post a snarky comment about the commercials but I'm too exhausted to do so because of the constant barrage of them
I really hope the Tide don't put the kid from Hawaii in...he scares me...and I think he's > hurts
The referee talks like he is the detective in a murder mystery at the dinner theatre playhouse.
in college, all plays are reviewed by the crew in the booth and the replay official can buzz down to the field for extended review at his discretion at any time
At least the super bowl has GOOD commercials. Jesus..
Yeah guys I can't afford your cars where are the Geo Metro commercials
Sick of the rap. 
I hate the complete catch rule in the ncaa as you only need one foot down. That''s a no catch in the nfl as it should be. It doesn''t really prepare them for the nfl.
I hate how much time these reviews give defences time to rest and get reoriented when they're on their heels. Goes both ways
Woo good thing we got a commercial break! I was starting to enjoy the flow of the game! 
Love CFB to death but I'm absolutely over reviewing every single play. 
I read every single one of them.
[deleted]
Just like life
They're getting plenty of rest with these commercials.
Who shit in your cereal this morning? 
I prefer living
I can't imagine what being at the games with the man in the red hat is like. 
Will Alabama get shut out??
This is beyond CBS, this some next level Bullshit
Yep, he is better overall. Hurts is ass my dude if you want anything other than a screen
I....... I like your idea. 
I'm expecting some "his left foot was on the Alabama player, who was out of bounds...therefore, his left foot was contacting out of bounds. Therefore the pass is incomplete"
STFU, what did Tennessee do this year?
Bruh
As a racing fan, bitching about commercial breaks feels so familiar.
Thats why they should start Tua :( 
Big game . Plus commercials for everyone !!!
Can't they just show us endless replays like the NFL??
I mean, it's Hollywood.  What'd you expect? Haha
Lol Allstate 
I care. Don''t sell yourself short. 
Yep. Don't even necessarily need a foot, I don't believe. Any part of your body, as long as it hits first.
nah fuck that place north of Texas
At my school we expect the basketball games to last longer than the football games haha
Anyone have a working stream?
Agree. He was down before the ball was knocked loose.
Yep, one foot and you're good
Refs are talking straight to the broadcast booth right now.  "No, we got about two more we gotta fit in.  Give us two more minutes"
Ya, Georgia might be doing well right now, but what if they had Sam Darnold?-ESPN, probably 
DGD.  Period.
Sure didn't. They did send the band to congratulate the one true champion, UCF, though.
Correct
After he'd already survived the ground. The defender hit him in the forearm.
Refs in the booth can call for reviews. Coaches can challenge, but they almost never have to.
He was Tina Feys boyfriend on and off in 30 Rock as well
Kirby Smart looks like he enjoys a good hard shell taco and drives a pickup truck with a shell.
What a dumb fucking decision to not snap the ball
And what does it even mean if our email address is on the dark web? Do I even care?
Another review that shouldn''t be happening.  They shouldn''t be getting buzzed for things that are clear on a single replay.
raise ur dongers
He's mostly known for being in 30 rock
Frenemy  BFF Boo roomie squad
Then can we get the holding call. 
Review the play, the hamsters over at WatchESPN need a break on the wheel.
THE BRODIEKAT
Damn ESPN, I have heard more commentary from Mayhem than from Herbstreit....
ESPN RN. Last game of the season Brent can't hold back on the commercials now.
The Blue Jackets scored! They''re only down 2-1
Bit of a bobble, they might overturn :/
Shhh let me believe
Is it now? Last I checked in, it was boring as hell
I''m feeling the love!
No
Saban dialing them up.
[[Cocks vs Army]]
What are y'all drinking this quarter? 
They were chomping at the bit to throw it to another commercial break
Where are all these alternate streams? 
Fromm would be drafted top ten if he was eligible rn
for real, this shit is annoying
Who tf buys an iPhone "for their squad"?
Disgustingly long commercials is helping give Bama a breather. Fuck off ESPN
I think we are setting a new all time for commercials.
I think they''re reviewing if he had control of the ball. I agree he was in, but didn''t get a good look at the ball movement because commercials are clearly more important. 
Indeed.Now, for housekeeping purposes, [Flair up or shut up my dude!](https://flair.redditcfb.com/)
so they can run more commercials
Just my opinion here but I think Saban needs to look for a new oc. Hurts makes stupid plays but I don't think he's getting a ton of great calls to begin with. 
An out of bounds player is touching the ball it has to be out of bounds no?
For the SEC, it just means more
Thanks, bro. 
Dying here, unable to watch any of it. r/cfbstreams has gone downhill, not a single working link. ESPN is worthless. I'm in Thailand so not like I can head over to the local bar and catch it. 
Um are QB''s allowed to make good passes? Can someone tell ours? :(
I doubt anyone disagrees
Please keep updating this 
Losing a challenge means you can't challenge again and you lose a timeout. Those are valuable things. And the officials can review unprovoked
Take a shot every time there's a commercial break
We want viewers to feel a sense of accomplishment when they finally get to watch the game. 
On mobileI check out the top 5 each time I refresh and upvote as appropriate. 
Only way to watch this game. Better than having commercials shoved down your throat every 2 minutes. 
No catch. He lost control going down to the ground. 
they commercialized the fuck out of this game.  It's worse than watching the Superbowl
Big Ten refs are all right. 
This is one of those tough to call. He survived the ground, but juggled the ball out of bounds after he landed.
I thought he would last to the super bowl. 
Correct
He's also in Brooklyn 99. Kinda plays the same guy.
https://youtu.be/etMlNW5w-50This guy at the game you think?
Really hard to see who''s going to win this game. On the one hand Bama has that SEC speed; on the other hand Georgia has that SEC speed. 
"Papa John's Confirmed" 
coaches don't challenge in CFB.  All reviews come from the booth.  They look at anything close
Is cat buckeye fan?
Remember when football games weren't interrupted by unnecessary reviews?
Opportunities for commercials 
TUA!
[Here go.](https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://img.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp-content/uploads/sites/36/2017/08/PIA01492-1-1024x1024.jpg&w=480)
I'd like to thank all you random internet strangers for giving me something to do while the ads are on. 
I''m surprised they didn''t wait until the Super Bowl to bring mayhem back.
If this was Bama-OU it would be a crazy advantage for Bama having all of these commercials slowing the game down.
Google some Chevy commercials and you''ll see what we see.
Who doesn't?
Ah, it's really hurting you guys right now. Being one step off in a game like this fucks with your whole defense
AT&T will now delay the game by 3 mins so it can show it at 2x speed to make more room for commercials. ESPN approves.
I don't mind some buffering, I don't mind some adds. But when adds buffer, I suffer.  
Is it ok that I genuinely had a tinge of excitement with mayhem coming back?
It''s fucked up how much time this gives the defense to catch their breath and game plan. 
Those fuckers have pipeline going. 
They''re trying to make the run pass option a thing. STOP TRYING TO MAKE IT A THING. 
Are you even able to walk outside right now? Without freezing? 
This commercial break is under review*Cuts to another commercial break*
I''m a little surprised that Jake Fromm''s LLWS experience hasn''t been brought up. There''s still time though. 
Nick Saban once tested positive for steroids, and Kirby Smart used to hold the frogger record at his hometown Pizza Parlor back in the early 80's.
I''m reading!
I read all of your comments.  Always.  I love you.
Yes, idk about hands though...
Dude you're gonna watch and they know it
They do but refs don''t give a shit. They review it even after the ball is snapped. 
Wrong sport. 
Obv a catch.
Fun fact! Refs are paid by the review
Ya basic
Who are Auburn fans rooting for?
No one is reading these comments
So why didn't you ask off for work tomorrow? 
Sigh
Either that or they spam you with emails after you give it to them
Looks like Fromm has settled in from the early adrenaline.
Nice, we needed to have a review break its been to long since we've had some commercials
At least when this game ends it will be spring game season.
Do you guys actually thing ESPN called the review? Lol. I know we all fucking despise ESPN but come the fuck on.
there is a push-out rule in college football no?
I don't use the live comment thing, I just sort by new and refresh every now and then 
My hdmi port broke some time ago and I'm too poor to replace it
Alabama doesn't look as good as I thought they'd be. What's going on...
The amount of commercials is absolutely insane!  Can we get more?
This is the south. Someone has a gun, he may be shot
Since we have an extended halftime, this game is going to last till nearly 1 a.m.This is embarrassing.
What kind of shit are you watching on Pornhub?
Someone is a baller
Must be nice to have a Good QB that can throw more than five yards down the field. 
UGA looks like the better team so far :/ 
Doubt it 
It counts as being in bounds, not down. 
There's a free stream on ESPN
Calls have both originally been made in Georgia''s favor, so it would be Saban having to challenge. Why would Kirby challenge a catch that was called a catch in the first place
I'm just going to sleep during the commercials so I can get a full 8 hours before this game is over next morning
Almost as bad as CBS
The ball came loose.
LOTS of ball to be played, never underestimate Saban
lol, fair enough
I''d much rather be watching commercials than reviewing video of the game and discussing football. 
Hopefully they run out of commercials by halftime.
Commercials have ruined it for me. Officially. Rugby is the supreme contact sport. 
If our offense doesn't do something next possession that's game.
I think that is a pretty common opinion to have.
I'm almost positive they're going to review any play they can tonight to get as many ads in as they can
No
Sure Chaney 
I've always wanted to watch more commercials than football
missed the game so far because I chose to go to a lecture for a class I was unsure I was going to take.  "management for engineers" NAH THAT SHIT WAS BORING AND HAD A LOT OF BOOKS, THANKS FOR WASTING MY TIME DAWG IMA TAKE SOME MORE MATH
Does hand down in bounds count? Or does it need to be a foot?
This one wasn't ESPN's fault... My Chromecast froze and I had to reboot it.So that makes it Google 1, ESPN 532
I think espn is actually forcing these replay reviews 
I'd rather not die 
No idea why Georgia was going so freaking slow. Hike the damn ball so they can't review it. Why does this always happen? Fromm was just meandering up to the line, looking around, didn't get set at all. And then the refs come in with their own T.O.The foresight and awareness of the players and coaches is nonexistent. 
I'm bringing everybody down with me
You right, need to set my shit up, will do it now. I'm a dawgs fan btw.
Did they really just say his name was Cavin?
Where's the commercial for 15 year old toyotas
Well considering it wasn't a catch....
[Flair up my dude!](https://flair.redditcfb.com/)
Does anyone have a counter running of how many minutes of commercials have run vs minutes of football?
Is this game sponsored by Mercedes?Is the half time featuring Kendrick Lamar?
Does anyone have a link to a stream?  I'm trying to watch the watchESPN stream but it is so fucking choppy.
There''s a football game?
probably. he went to the rose bowl
The commercials
Bane
Unless there's a commercial on.
There's obviously no such thing tonight.
Overreaction: Fromm will win 6 Super Bowls! He is THE GOAT! 
These commercials are too deep for me i don't like it. Makes me uncomfortable
I choose life.
Thanks for bringing back those memories
yup
What happens when they run out of commercials?
So what seemed a close, but clear catch will be overturned?
I'm just sitting here thinking about the points we didn't score when we should have scored them.
This game might beat out Fox in commericals
Came here for the football. Left with 2 new vehicles, a brand new iPhone, and getting my taxes done cheap.
I'm reading this thread. Haven't even thought of flipping the actual game on.
Nobody is reading? Speak for yourself.
Really?  I think they may overturn this... if it''s the nfl, it''s coming back. 
Where that at 
[Flair up my dude!](https://flair.redditcfb.com/)
Even the Film Room is split. Catch rules are brutal. 
Bold prediction: Taylor Swift shocks the world and joins Kendrick at halftime. 
This play under review is brought to you by Nissan, it''s your turn to drive. 
It has. 
UGA is looking good.
What's the over/under in Vegas for game length? 
Why the fuck does that need to be reviewed? Are they serously just doing it for the commercials?
If you hate commercials and have espn news then put on the coaches film room
Georgia was going to score if there wasn''t a review there.
Who the heck is that?
we'll all be dead by halftime
He is still scooting home from California.
**FUCK YOU ESPN. YOU CANNOT STREAM THE GAME, BUT THOSE COMMERCIALS SURE RUN SMOOTH AS BUTTER. FUCK YOU.**
National Commercial Break Bowl
Meteor
Not a movie, but he plays a character on the TV show Brooklyn Nine-Nine
I care...
Team Meteor.
North Korea to bomb the game. 
Yep
They had a 30 minute thing about it before the show.
At least? Dude spring ball blosz 
I hear he's had a tough time adjusting to American Life.
Now thats a STEAMING Hot take. 
Auburn 2929 champs, calling it now
I think what you're doing could be considered murder in some places.
Commercial *
I'd hate to be Jeremy Pruitt at halftime 
He had full possession and was down. The Alabama player knocked the ball loose but that shouldn't matter because he'd already caught it and was down. This is gonna be an NFL nonsense technicality call if they rule incomplete 
Your comment is under further review. Let''s go to a quick commercial break that lasts three times longer than it takes to do the review
There's a sub for that I believe 
hes way better than hurts. hurts is not a good qb. he can run but he isnt a good passer.
No, and it shouldn''t be in college either.
Kendrick bb
Dammit SEC Network. Why show commercials the same time ESPN does? Do like the coaches room and have none!
[Flair up my dude!](https://flair.redditcfb.com/)
After he was already on the ground lol
wtf why does football keep interrupting my commercials
new kung-fu kenny
Sweeeeet Caaaaroliiiiiiine
thanks, so do I, lol :)
They're going to play commercials over the Kendrick concert, aren't they?
Our offense looks so bad, and our qb play is pretty typical Jalen so a 10 point deficit seems insurmountable 
Geico shoulda done this commercial. He falls in the water and they tell him at least they saved money on car insurance.
Jon Hamm is a national treasure
SWEET CAROLINA
That turbotax commercial was terrifying.
I'm 16 shots in
These commercials are long and shitty, but at least my taxes are free
Could that Benz logo be any larger? Wtf
K dot
I know, right? ATT trying to be cool like T-Mobile and they just can't be T-Mobile. Look at us, fellow kids.
hail the bison
the only thing I can figure is that they want to ensure that he had possession of the ball throughout the catch since there's no doubt that he got a foot and a hand in before anything else.
They mentioned it on this drive.
If you are watching via the ESPN stream, watch the command center feed.  Some form of watching people watch football instead of commercials.
I don't have a death wish.
Because Allstate needs me to know I'm in good hands during the National Championship presented by AT&T featuring the Taco Bell student section where I can get an iPhone 8 to know that I'm protected by Capitol One while doing my taxes through Turbo Tax so I can maybe afford the Mercedes I've always wamted
That's ample time for Georgia to become the team everyone hates on /r/cfb!
Must be nice to take 5 minute random timeouts to reset your defense after a long drive
Suicide is never the answer
As is tradition. 
These reviews kill momentum
BLACK PANTHER PARTY
Alabama just because it has come down to me and my brother in our bowl mania group. 
FIRE. DABOLL.
Love it even as a shitpost!
No:(
What's it like to get a stop on 3rd down?
Some great wisdom right there
Yeah I love the insights I'm getting from these coaches on the fly.
hockey
I swear anyway. 
I think they just showed a few mins ago on ESPN News that they confirmed the call and UGA lined up to run a play and they blew it dead Bc ESPN was still in commercial.Honestly fuck ESPN, can we start tweeting @ then and blow them up?
Im liking how this game is going but Saban and those half time adjustments scare me 
Fam I know it's the Natty but you don't need to die on this day. 
Take a shot every time this awful NBA Saturday Primetime commercial plays. My stream plays it 3x in a row almost every stoppage.
Lets kill of of UGAs momentum with commercials.
New kenny?!
Exactly...this commercial is fucking stupid. And you still gotta pay $699 per phone smfh
Georgia did about a week ago
What a strange time for Sweet Caroline
Very subtle advertising there
My wife asked why they aren''t having replays for Bama, and then she said, oh yeah, Bama isn''t doing anything
b/c Hurts is a RB playing QB
"On the Mercedes-Benz halftime report, MORE. COMMERCIALS"
I was waiting to take a shot for every point Bama got, but the bottle is still sealed.
Idk they have some Frank ocean concerts on there
"hey refs, we need another commercial break, review some obvious call"
bama killed that run, lol
Coaches room is having alot less commercials
Why do they need half an hour of commercials every time there is an obvious call that the refs got right in the first place? this is horseshit.
"Coming up, on the Mercedes Benz halftime report, more commercials!"
Alabama seems kind of out of sorts 
[proof](https://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/7nhkux/comment/ds1yian?st=JC70JN48&sh=5f48fafa) 
No
Like, what do they EXACTLY say they will do? I'm curious what they would actually do for you.
So it's just a giant fucking Disney ad for a halftime show
We''re playing like we''re stunned, letting them make every play. We always do this when a couple things don''t go our way. 
ded
Is there even a single advertising team that does a unique job anymore?
Over/under on halftime length?
I want Kendrick.
I thought they''d drag the mayhem thing on till the Super Bowl at least. 
If you guys are watching the film room cast David Cutcliffe Duke Coach is putting on a clinic
Is there a petition or something so we can complain about the reviews and commercials?
My stopwatch doesn't go that high
A tie. If they played this game all night and neither team won, I would be happy.
Sometimes it happens with ads, too (even ones that play often), it's just much more common during the actual game. 
My great uncle died falling off a cruise ship.
Anyone want to guess the over/under on how much of Kendrick's performance will be censored?
I found a working sd stream on firstrow
Some of the alt streams on ESPN are fine, like coaches room, sky can, homers
Shit, no one beats cocks like army.  
The half time show will probably be stopped by a commercial.
Chubb looking flat today 
I wanna go to a game at Mercedes Benz stadium sometime. That stadium is so fucking dope.
Could have had it all on the keeper there
DB smacks it as he's on his back already down.
Yeah no that dude is either dead or internally bleeding. The fuck is this commercial TurboTax?
Well he drove a scooter from Athens to Pasadena last week so I'd say there's a good chance. He's fairly dedicated to the team.
Saban forgot to renew his contract with the devil. 
Way too early to play sweet Caroline 
I would legit be ok with pulling Jalen at halftime. This is getting sad. He can't complete shit. 
Omg they are only mentioning the half time report. At this rate, we will reach half time in an hour lol
Jalen Hurts is JT Barrett
At this rate, next year's CCG will have a commercial after every play
New music?
Must've had a bet there how many times can Kendrick Lamar can be said in a statement meow?
Bama: *loses the National Championship*Reporter: Nick how do you feel about this crushing defeat?Nick: Well at least my taxes are free
I can identify with that guy jumping of the boat.
More commercials than offense. Sounds like what we expected lol
Took your DC and several recruits away
Welcome to Disney's presentation of some football Brought to you By Star Wars, Marvel, The Black Panther, Bob Iger's mom, and Mickey Mouse
Kirby is a Saban pawn, and Alabama never “screwed up” and had penalty issues with Smart, so that could be a big part of it. Smart is also extremely disciplined and the guys aren''t committing atrocious penalties.

I''m off but I got called in for a job interview. Not sure how I feel about it. I''m used to drinking towards a victory. 
OK ILL CAPITALIZE
Final score; 3-0 UGA. You heard it here first folks.
Procedural thing, gotta get set.Also, [Flair up my dude!](https://flair.redditcfb.com/)
Lol did they even show the ruling? Or did they show too many commercials?
I wonder who sponsored the halftime report
The main ESPN stream sucks. But try the hometown radio feed. Same broadcast, less people streaming it, plus hometown radio broadcasters instead of ESPN announcers!Other option I like is the sky cam or the sounds of the game stream. Sounds of the game is great cuz it''s the same video feed of the main stream, but all you hear is the crowd, the bands, and the PA announcer!
You know there are too many commercials when they have time to play Sweet Caroline during a fucking review 
So reviews are now excuses for commercial breaks to run mid-drive?
But no look back on the season we just had?
Prediction: Field goal, commercial, kick-off, commercial, punt, commercial.
ESPN playing so many commercials because that''s all that actually works on the watchESPN app..
Fromm is Jesus at QB. Why does UGA even run it? 
Restaurant next to me closes at 10. Been waiting for commercials to end fuck
Why are they not showing replays? I mean I love commercials, but really
That counter would be too depressing
That sounds pretty accurate to me
Might want to sit down Reece. At this pace halftime is a good two hours away.
EAT SHIT PITT!Wait, sorry, WVU conditioned me for whenever I hear that song.
If only colleges and universities had music programs that could be put on display for halftime shows....
Is there going to be a thread for the halftime show???
/r/FellowKids 
Ah thats right. My mistake.
r/hiphopheads is leaking
Who is 94 for bama, dude is a beast
I want that touchdown, please no field goal
*Mountain dew for me and you*
Who is this guy holding Kirby back all game?
Wait... Kirby has a pants holder?
I've never been more excited about the halftime show more than during this ass game.
Only read the top 4 then f5
pm'd
Kelvin.  He's an absolute zero
[Flair up my dude!](https://flair.redditcfb.com/)
Rece with his manufactured TV voice smh
We need another commercial break, so let's use this big play that was obviously the correct call as an excuse to review the play so we can cut to one.
Can you get a whiter narrator than that iphone commercial? holy shit.
For me the commercials are actually pretty crappy too
Idk what it's even like to get a stop on first
That is a silver lining.
Maybe the Clemson gameplan was still shit, but Alabama attacked Bryant relentlessly and forced his hand 
The giant Merc logo is what this whole thing is about.
Kendrick is the only non-Disney thing about the halftime
ESPN trolls reddit for content.  You will have your wish granted.
Sure, close enough to warrant review IMO though.
I think it's a girl.Small sample size, but I've lived under 3 different women and one group of guys.The guys were loud on weekends because they had people over. The girls were loud always because they're 115 lbs of pure cement. 
That's what cracks me up.  Like the commercials are crystal clear, but the game is trash.
I can't wait for ESPN to start broadcasting and streaming in 4K. I'm excited about the players looking like Minecraft characters.
They just needed to show more commercials.They didn't really need to review that catch.
I'm regretting saying I'd go into work at 730. 
Nope, its just like Hollywood. Rehash old shit or just make shit.
Lol, love how Kirby is being kept on a leash.
ADS ADS ADS!A D S ADS ADS ADS!
Ugh right? At least they pause the sport when they force feed us our corporate sponsorship here
Football > no football
[Flair up my dude!](https://flair.redditcfb.com/)
"this game is being played the way we thought?"Terribly?
Implying the game will end before noon
But that star of the sea
His hammer, maybe. 
Fromm is gonna run one in on 3rd, can feel it in my plums 
You saw the black peace sign too?
I was watching the coaches film room version of the game and it was amazing! No commercials and live breakdown by real coaches 
Championship games against Alabama bring back the worst memories for Texas fans...so welcome to the pit of misery! Dilly dilly!
I''m just here to watch Bama fans panic 
Lmao who's the assistant responsible for keeping Kirby off the field 
Tomorrow's headlines: "All of r/cfb dies from alcohol poisoning"
Like rural Michigan is that much better....
One of the coach was just holding Kirby by the belt. That was of odd 
Who can out adjust who?
It somehow looks like both sets of genitalia at the same time
So much advertising, its really ridiculous. 
Man there's really no streams avbl? Lame
Is there a slight audio dealy or just me?
Wims butterfingers
They should put a handle on Kirby
TFW I''ll never grab Kirby Smart''s butt on national tv
Two.  Lots of "reviews" await, I'm sure.
It was 
Bama looks so bad
LOL they keep cutting Dan off when he starts ripping the game 
[deleted]
How long has this drive been?
Hold me back bro
Put on ESPN news, basically no commercials and it''s pretty interesting to listen to them chop it up
td please
This play is huge here. 
come on dawgs, get that touchdown pretty please
Sick Kirby wedgie 
94 is an animal
And yes, I know that's not possible. Unfortunately.
gotta catch that
Yo dawg, we heard you like kendrick lamar, so we put on some kendrick lamar, then we'll show some more kendrick lamar, so you can listen to kendrick lamar while you listen to kendrick lamar. 
To point out the ridiculous amount of ads in this game, I'm going to play a game of NCAA 2005 in my dynasty and see how far I get when Kendrick Lamar hits the stage. I'll post updates in this thread to keep y'all informed. Right now it's the kickoff of the game in Week 8 of 2018 between my #1 Florida Gators (4-0) at home against #14 LSU (3-1). LSU won the toss and chose to receive
6-0 snoozefest coming up.
SEC Network feed with synchronized local radio is fucking awesome. Better than Chris Fowler''s dumbass 
Im glad that they could fit an extra commercial in so we didn't have to deal with watching the refs decision on the review. What a joke.
ESPN's streaming servers are actually just a spare Raspberry Pi they found in the engineering department's break room.
I feel like I need to pee but I just peed. Not sure if from beer or nerves.
Hopefully we find out right now...
Because Chubb and Michel?
That db got there a bit early...
Hour & 10 
I'm a little confused by the fact that they kept pointing out that he got his hand down, so he was in. Anywhere else on the field if you put your hand on the ground you aren't considered down as a runner, so why on the sideline?
You would be surprised how few people affiliated with CFB care about it preparing players for the NFL.
Einstök White Ale, delicious Icelandic beer production <3
Fromm is NFL talent. Hurtz about to become a punt returner.
/r/cfb mods have the in with ESPN to air 18x the usual commercials, thereby giving them time to stand up all these pesky game threads.
Lol, why is that guy holding Kirby back? :P 
How much you think Kirby's restraint guy makes? 
Gotta throw it again here.
Who is the guy holding Kirby smart by the pants all game?
Says here on your resume that you held Kirby Smart's pants. Tell us about that. 
Who would win? Some reddish elephunks or some peach cobbler woofy bois.
Pro tip: If you use one of the other ESPN streams, you won't have any buffering issues. Film Room has no commercials too, might miss the initial play on that one though. 
Kirby on a tight leash 
get these Georgia receivers some glue 
[deleted]
38min. 6 commercial breaks
I like how that guy has to hold on to Kirby Smart by his belt hilarious
Halftime concerts at a CFB game. What is this world coming to?
Eventually we'll be in some Black Mirror type future where the broadcast is 99% commercials only interrupted for by a guy who reads the score off, then resumes commercials.And to change your channel, you have to watch another set of commercials.
That's kinda what ABC pays for
WE MISSED THE CALL?!?!
The number 4 seed always sucks
The main ESPN stream sucks. But try the hometown radio feed. Same broadcast, less people streaming it, plus hometown radio broadcasters instead of ESPN announcers!Other option I like is the sky cam or the sounds of the game stream. Sounds of the game is great cuz it''s the same video feed of the main stream, but all you hear is the crowd, the bands, and the PA announcer!
Given Rose Bowl, SEC, ND games, Yes.Given the Auburn game, No.I'll go with yes.
Payne I believe
Anyone else''s ESPN stream absolute crap?I''m using a Roku 10 feet from the router
RUN THE BALL THIS CLOSE TO THE END ZONE. HAVE THE SEAHAWKS TAUGHT YOU NOTHING
Is there a different broadcast. I'd  rather watch his En Espanol bro. Damn ESPN why bro why this high school quality sideline Snapchat BS? This sideline idea is a No MAS!
I'm just sad about yesterday...
let's go baby!
Guess you don't have to survive the ground in college. 
Not a Daboll fan.
Da''ron Payne, caught a TD last week too
Georgia TD -> Georgia winGeorgia FG -> Bama win
Holy hell. That is a giant hanging commercial next to Reese.
Sweet Carolineeee... suck my balllllssssssss
LMAO I was watching on ESPN 2 and not ESPN. Whew...
I'm actually salty about our momentum being stifled on this drive by commercials
He just seems on a different planet tonight.
Who is the dude holding Kirbys pants?
Lmao Kirby Smart's designated pants guy 
This game is so boring. Just cancel it already. 
I thought UCF wasn't playing today.
Wallace with the freebie PI because bama
I'm setting it at 40 mins.
All the comments about the commercials are more obnoxious than the commercials themselves. Is this your first time watching a sporting event in the last 2 decades?
They need Alabama to win
A D S A D S ADS ADS ADS!
You''ll have blood on your hands
Nobody is perfect?
Who is Mr Clean putting his hand down Kirby's pants
Learning so much from Cutcliffe. 
Kendrick will stop mid-Humble to shill Dr Pepper.
i saw that, players went from like 800k to 200k in one question and it wasnt even savage wtf
SO, I guess the review was confirmed?  Thanks ESPN.
Its ridiculous that coaches need other staff to grab their pants to keep them off the field
Georgia and Bama just tryna repeat the 2011 Bama-LSU regular season game 
Insightful. 
Why was that dude holding kirby smarts belt?
The first ever half time performance! 
Oh yeah, that's right.  Kendrick Lamar.  I actually forgot about that.  Meh
*removes sun glasses*Don''t you get it? Halftime IS the commercial!
These lame espn commercials gave Bama's defense a break when Georgia was in a rhythm.
So this guys job is told the georgia coaches waistband so he doesn''t run in the field?
FUCK
Touchdown please please please
Fuck they caught us. SCATTER.
Daron Payne. Got the key int and a TD last week. 
How is it that we have all these commercials but ESPN can''t pay for enough server support that the WatchESPN app doesn''t stutter like Colin Firth in ‘The King''s Speech''
I think the commercials are Cleary dominating this game
Yiu know who would really help them out? Aaron Judge--ESPN definitely 
It's extremely infuriating. 
Georgia is pretty good too? 
Loving the Lebetard megacast 
Our S&C coach, also moonlight as a coach wrangler
Guys, in case you weren't aware, Saturday starts NBA prime time on ABC.  
Screw it with commercials. Im sick and have an 8am tomorrow. Im gonna go to bed.
Damn
What about that TurboTax commercial with the dancing bear?
$$$
SEC ON CBS
*Me drowning in commercials as the football game slowly steers away from me.* "At least my taxes are free."
I'm just a really big fan of the fact that Georgia's kicker wears glasses inside his helmet. Never seen that before
Holding the coach by the belt? That's ridiculous.They should just put him on one of those toddler leashes.
Shhiiiiiiiitttt if only that was a pick...
Well that throw was almost disastrous 
dang it
Jesus Christ even the Kendrick Lamar commercial at halftime is really just a Black Panther commercial
that could have ended terribly
Settle for field goal for Georgia 
Wonder how much they're paying the guy to hold Kirby to the sidelines
Okay, one play. I need another commercial break. Is that family still stuck in that Chevy?
Man that was dangerous. Don't know how it wasn't picked honestly. 
Like that, finally.
UGA, so I don''t have to hear UAT fans all year (I live in Bama). 
My condolences 
Awh this clears it up. Thank you
Gundy''s mullet on Coaches Film Room is fucking glorious 
Stone Cold Steve Austin on the UGA sideline. woah.
Lucky that wasn''t picked lol. Dangerous throw 
9-6 calling it
Yeah I'd fire his ass.
The meteor.Otherwise, probably depends on where they are from and how old they are. My parents are pulling for UGA and I'm pulling for Bama. UGA fans have been shitty to me and Bama fans have been pretty cool. But I get the Bama hate too.
I for one enjoy field goals
Rich Chigga performing at halftime! its lit
On the subject of Kendrick Lamar, I mentioned to my girlfriend how I used to make this toast sandwich with apple butter and maple syrup when I worked at a breakfast place in high school. She said "you mean syrup sandwiches?"I forgot about syrup sandwiches.
Now over to Guy LeDouche
Anyone here likes to suffer enough to watch Finebaum's film room NCG on SEC Network?
THIS GAME IS AN INSTANT CLASSIC!!!!!!!!
Uhh why are they passing it
REGULATION IS OPPRESSION
I'm not saying the fix is in, but its funny anytime Georgia gets a big third down and is in the red zone the play is "reviewed" and alabama gets a free time out,  kills the momentum, and gets to set up their defense. Not going to be surprised if we have to kick again.
That's a win by the D.
25 minutes
So if the Huskies were playing the ducks for the Natty trophy and there's a play that puts them first and goal that was close enough that there is a shadow of a doubt you wouldn't want it reviewed to be 100% sure?
I want to be Kirbys butt holder
Really dumb pass
All 45,000 people spread out amongst the empty seats are enthralled by this big time game
Keep him from getting on the field
Damn fromm was ready to risk it all right there
The fact this doesn''t have 200 upvotes makes me sad. Seriously. He''s like the Auburn of Politics. Everyone has a reason to hate him. 
Just *another* classic SEC barnburner.
That hurts 
no
Would be nice if the Alabama announcers could get the Georgia players names correct. 
JUST RUN THE BALL
Let's go bubbles!
The cameraman looking right into the back of the coach lol
Lol that guy holding Kirby''s pants so he doesn''t charge the field 
Michel was like “WHY CANT YOU BE TOM BRADY”
I desperately need the link to the Stugotz Marlins vs Cardinals broadcast 
it's not the advertising teams its the companies who hire them. The companies usually override ideas or even worse suggest stuff
Both teams defense is playing very well though
All of us
6-0 doesn't feel like shit against bama 
Ugh. These replays are momentum killers 
Give the trophy to UCF already
The main ESPN stream sucks. But try the hometown radio feed. Same broadcast, less people streaming it, plus hometown radio broadcasters instead of ESPN announcers!Other option I like is the sky cam or the sounds of the game stream. Sounds of the game is great cuz it''s the same video feed of the main stream, but all you hear is the crowd, the bands, and the PA announcer!
G L A S S E S K I C K E RLASSESKICKER
This is the stupidest CFB championship game ever.
This game gives me flashbacks to that LSU-Bama game that finished 9-6
Oh, OK.  there's the freshman QB.
It is always ass on every device. Why I've used cfbstreams all year
As a Carolina Panthers fan, I'm getting some bad flashbacks to yesterday's game with all these Red Zone breakdowns.
Mods there should be a halftime thread too. Shits gonna be the length of a quarter. Probably complete with commercials midsong.
Glasses kicker gon be mvp 
Ok, why is there a guy with the job of holding on to Kirby Smart's pants? 
6-0 at the half.. I think so!
And you don't run the ball because.....?
He's the S&C coach 
and does he make more than the guy who holds Venables?
It's the kind of thing that makes you want to sing, "Bitch, don't kill my vibe!"
Goggles remains perfect
Maybe you have a UTI
You won't be able to tell because of all the f****** commercials
A team has momentum? Call a commercial break so that it stays close.
This game is ass cancer.
In the history of half times!
Blakenship -- MVP
The ESPNU Voices MegaCast is fucking atrocious
Get a PSVUE, YoutubeTV or Sling trial and watch the regular network like that.
Hopefully
He prevents sideline penalties. Kirby gets a little animated. 
Agreed
Kick -> commercial.FML
My guess for the final score cannot deal with another fg
UGA field goal, long Bama TD drive, half time, long Bama TD drive, ball game.
There's always a coaches belt guy. He just holds coaches back when they get pissed and want to tackle somebody on the field.
Awww man. How is it on console? Is it less or more punishing? Last season I played before 7 was season 3 and I only maxed out at like ~2001 mmr.Had some late night games day before with some lvl 700s+ >_>
Hello, may I interest you in my reverse funnel scheme
IN STADIUM, POP NOISE HURTSWHOS IDEA WAS THIS
Based on what I've heard here in the past week, it has something to do with being in the SEC. Apparently it just means more.
To keep him from running into the field
Maybe Bama's kicker just needs glasses
W(h)im(p)s
Gofundme for a Kirby leash
Called it long ago lol
GOGGLES PART 2
Tuck that necklace away, Fromm. Aqib Talib bout to come snatch it
Goggles for MVP
YOU DON'T?
The broadcast with only crowd noise is pretty nice. No weird camera angles or commentary
I don''t know about my friends on CFB right now but every time I see a commercial, I make a mental note to never purchase that item for life... purely out of football interruption spite. 
In this game every point really does mean more.
Is the kicker that guy from Coach?
This is great
Man they should've run there. why 3 passes
Blue Jackets tie it up!!
Watching grass grow is more exhilarating than this game is. 
when is that supposed to happen anyway?  Football in 4k is one of the main reasons I switched to DirectTv but it's all basketball and golf.Every once in awhile there will be a cfb game in 4k but instead of the 5 ranked matchups they'll have that day, Baylor v. OU or some bullshit is shown instead.
Rich Rod is available. You guys can have him.
GLASSESEdit: GOGGLES
Can''t wait to see the Black Panther trailer tonight.
5k comments. I feel like we can hit 12k before the 2nd quarter ends
I lowered the resolution just so it would work without buffering 
#BUM BUM BUM
I'll take that. Good job holding.
I dont like the new iphone emoji commercials, bring the ones back with the blinde girl singing the big boi song
There will be! Have no fear!
That''s ESPN2. ESPN is the main feed
Man your Goggles folks. 
Nerd 
It''s not :(
Georgia won the title the year after clemson last time...
bama gonna score on this drive now
C''mon Bama! Auburn died for this 
On ESPN News they showed the Ref confirming the catch and then Georgia lined up to run the next play and they blew it dead Bc ESPN was still in commercial. Took 3 more minutes before they came back.
We just run screaming anyway for the shock factor lol, but we're still down to the second most of the time
9:30 and we just reached the halfway point of the game. Fuuuuckkk......
Hedley Lamarr? Now I'm excited.https://youtu.be/gBmkyDTX08Y
We're still going to finish this half in 90 minutes.
ESPN seems so desperate for every. Single. Penny. It feels like no other network has half of the commercials.
Review and commercial break stalled Georgia. So obnoxious just let them play.
This game actually sucks
Fieldgoalian Dynomite
Fromm panicked or he would have seen 1 wide open
We're gonna have a kicker MVP at this rate 
Kendrick better perform DNA tonight.
Your comment is gonna get buried probably cause sooooo many people are commenting, but know that I saw this and about crapped my pants laughing
Woops
This isn't a "DAE SEC sucks?" thing but this goes to show why it's not fun to watch two college teams playing an NFL style.
There will be one!
Airing his nervous farts
It might be better if they could play more than two downs in a row without a commercial. 
Rodrigo got Clout Goggles
To prevent a penalty for being too far out on the field.
Nighty night 
Yes, unwatchable 
What if Kendrick Lamar reveals a UCF National Champions shirt during his performance?
Game will not end 3-2 confirmed.
Goggles again!
Ya boy specs
Everyone knew this game would be ass . 
Red zone stand to hold them to a FG?  I''ll take it.
GOGGLES!
GOGGLES SIR
No.
Hey, how did that dude manage to use his leg to kick the ball through those big yellow forks? Can we get someone to do that?
COMMERCIAL INCOMING!
SI made that article about how punters might be the winning factor. Turns out it's kickers.
I'll take the 3. Better than goose egg
[deleted]
ALL HAIL THE ROD
I''m a simple man. I see “EAT SHIT PITT”, I upvote. 
Did you see lsu Alabama a few years ago...
Fromm really hasn't made any good passes
G O O D B O Y E SEORGIA_Edit: thank you
Blankenship is easily the best kicker who''s worn glasses, had a mustache and been named Blankenship, of all time. 
He gets excited 
Defense!
Georgia kicker is peak BMS special teams 
SEC defense or SEC offense?
MILHOUSE SCORES AGAIN!
Georgia wins 12-3 in a game with only field goals, calling it now
This nerd really wearing glasses?
Spoiler, it isn't
Seriously he can't keep getting away with it!
The Alabama players was standing out of bounds holding the Georgia receiver up and touched the ball. How does that not make it out of bounds? That seems like a massive loophole.
Field Goals and Commercials. 
>OutsideAre you talking about /r/outside?
real nice of them to give Bama's defense a free timeout.... the commercials are ridiculous.
The only cool thing in Georgia is Road Atlanta
There's suffering then there's self flagellation.
Jesus looked at them and said, "With man this is impossible, but with GOGGLES all things are possible."
Levi Wallace you are making Tucson proud I don't care about the rest of the team, okay?
This is not how a football game is meant to be played.
I can''t be the only one who''d rather have the band do something insane than fucking Kendrick Lamar
No it doesn't 
SON DON'T TALK ABOUT MY NERD LIKE THAT
AIN'T NOTHING BLANK ABOUT BLANKENSHIP
Georgia not getting a touchdown is going to hurt 
Alright fellas get ready for another commercial break
I''m getting unpleasant flashbacks to Bama LSU
I guess we can't complain.  We got our money's worth in the GA OU game.
truth
The real hero
So he doesn''t run onfield and DDT someone
Uhhhh, I hate Greg mcellroy after his whole spiel on how Penn State was the best team in the big ten at the fiesta bowl.
Why does he do that?  Just to make sure coach isn't on the field when the ball is snapped or his he giving Kirby resistance training all game?
Get ready for more commercials.
Kickers Win Championships^TM
Next season if rodrigo doesn''t take his team picture with his goggles on I will be *very* disappointed. 
What has GA done with the team that was run first?
Lmfao
I'm a tide fan but I can't help but like Blankenship 
Damn, Michel was wide open.
Kicker gets MVP?
This kicker looks like his girlfriend cheated on him with Baker Mayfield. 
Was Fromm trying to throw a pick-six on third and goal?
It is, but you have to dig the irony of making fun of rednecks with a typo like this lol> I here
I firmly disagree.  This game is great, low scoring but incredibly exciting defenses.
Yeah. The throwing lane wasn't there to lead Sony.
I would disagree. They're clearly struggling against your defense and any points matter vs their defense right now. 
It's a foul if the coach enters the field.
Dawgs are looking like the Falcons.  Not sure FG's will cut it.
The ads are such cancer. Completely breaking these games.
ohhh trust me, it feels like shit. 
Alabama needs to score more points if they want to win.
If your defense is notoriously aggressive you get to do that.
What else you got going on tonight? Do you have ESPN News?It's a defensive battle which is fine, but the main ESPN is cramming in as many commercials as possible. The Coach's room makes it much better.
THANK YOU BASED GOGGLES
It would be halfway through halftime
Water is wet
And then people here whine about cord cutting...
Yup. I think you are right.
Reviews killing momentum
One step closer to a 6-9 All-SEC National Championship final score.Nice.
even tho we got points that felt like such a huge downer after such a great drive, huge hold by bama
Georgia is going to lose this game, they can't finish drives. Alabama has been trash offensively but I have faith they can actually score at the end of their drives 
That is the only way I think we have a chance to win.  Hurts is just not good enough at finding open receivers to win against y'alls defense.  If his first target is not open then he pretty much never completes a pass.
Please tell me Blankenship is also known as Wild Thing
If that throw was in front of sony that would have been a td
Do you like commercials?
Guess the asshats tryna price gouge people got fucked
I was just memeing. lol it would be fucking hilarious though if it happened.
Dawgs have been so solid so far. But it feels like settling for FGs won't get it done against Saban.
LSU vs. Bama *The Squeakquel*. 
An exilerating match to be sure 
Goggles MVP as always
You ever watch a CBS game?
Try the stream with the Georgia radio calls its working for me
The way this game is going, 3 points is a win. 
it could be 6-4
I''m *shocked* we don''t have a commercial break here before the kickoff.
Pls no more QB draws, our O-line will not block for Jalen
Fuck this, I'm putting on a replay of the UCF natty game
I'd take pre-recorded clips of John Madden hastily arranged and played over the current commentary. 
you mean brian?
Incoming commercial. 
holding them to 3 is a win. that could've been a lot worse. 
The main ESPN stream sucks. But try the hometown radio feed. Same broadcast, less people streaming it, plus hometown radio broadcasters instead of ESPN announcers!Other option I like is the sky cam or the sounds of the game stream. Sounds of the game is great cuz it''s the same video feed of the main stream, but all you hear is the crowd, the bands, and the PA announcer!
16 plays.  That's bad coaching on Daboll's part.
As long as the result is the same for bama, idc.
Boring... Boring... Boring... makes me regret missing Monday night Raw for this.
Watch the Premier League, constant gameplay for an entire 45 minutes.
Hey guys 
CBS?
My Roku is maybe 2 feet from my router and I'm having issues. Fuck ESPN, DirectvNow and Grande Communications. I blame all of them equally, regardless of if it's deserved.EDIT: What does it matter anyway because this ENTIRE FUCKING GAME IS JUST COMMERCIALS ANYWAY
3 beers
Numerically, 2018 is an aesthetic year.
TD58!
“And now for a quick commercial break, we haven''t had one in a while”
Can we bring back Oklahoma at halftime and have an entertaining game?
Them dawgs is being hell, but those need to be sixes and not half sixes. 
ope
r/cfb would lose its mind
HOT TAKE ALERT
Yeah, that's why people are commenting about it. Way more commercials than 2 decades ago
sure, but I was also just making a joke lol. well, partially with how many fucking commercials are playing 
I know the kicker's on the football team... but if he wasn't I think he'd get negative poon.
Im back. And I missed the part when Georgia took all the momentum. And now my mom decided to watch the game. God I'm pissed now.
we want Tua
Gotta respect the BCG's on the kicker.
Thomas davis sighting
This why no one wants an all SEC championship 
Boom in the shot
chubby dagg bammer
How long is halftime? Is it actually extended? 
You mean 6-9
That was close
I'm drunk and I hat all y'all!
r/nedforpresident
Worst timeline confirmed
Who is 94 for Bama? He's a monster
This is going to be a game of field goals, isn''t it
Peyton is better
I got placed Plat at around 2600 my first season but I ran with a whole crew. A bunch of kids, man. I hate playing with kids.
What if Kendrick Lamar reveals a UCF National Champions shirt during his performance? 
[Serious] can someone good with stats go through this game and track commercials (#, total run times) and compare that to actual game play time?? I think it would be seriously eye opening considering there has been 9 commercial breaks already so far with 7:55 still left to play in the 2nd quarter 
ESPN is goddamn unwatchable between the constant commercials and buffering. Geez wonder why people are cutting the cord left and right and your shitty greedy company is in the process of going bankrupt.
>sees GatoradeSee, we're the real National Champions
3 is better than 0
This game is turning out to be what I thought. 
Sigh... I miss Kiffin
How about we take a shot downfield for once ?
This requires Bama to score a field goal....
there's a sub with better cfbstreams. dont think i can mention it even though I technically did. wink 
2 passes
Bama shoutout pls
I'm happy with only 3 there bu we need points. 
[I wrote a new fight song for Georgia.](https://youtu.be/-q00RW0EM3U)
I thought it was before
Final score gonna be 21-0 without a touchdown
Well their ratings have gone to shit on anything that's not a major sporting event, they probably need all these ads to keep the lights on and to keep Kirk's hair gelled
No way Alabama actually scores a field goal.
Shouldn''t Texas fans at least be semi-interested in elite defensive play?
Don't give them any ideas. 
OOTL. Explain?
It would be nice if the Bama offense could do something.  Shitty play calling so far.  Hurts is also playing badly.
It's tied??!!! Wtf are these guys on
Why are we not at commercial after a score?
officials in the booth can call for a review of anything that seems questionable instead of relying on a coaches challenge.  It isn't uncommon to also see a coach burn a time out instead of doing a formal challenge to get the booth some more time to have another look at the play.
Yes.Also, [You've been visited by me, the Flair Fairy, so flair up or shut up, my dude!](https://flair.redditcfb.com/)
The Georgia Bulldogs are Fromming at the mouth 
GO DAWGS
Thanks, Harvard
Who is Nick Saban sacrificing in a pentagram during half time?
pretty awesome the whole stadium except for a few dingdongs cheered for the POTUS.this game sucks so far.
I believe he player "sockar" before. Some foreign sport. 
[deleted]
This game turned into Alabama / LSU so gradually we didn''t even notice.
mad props by bama, great stop esp, when the Dawgs had a great drive going
Time to kneel 3 downs to give them back the ball
Two QBs and a punter sitting on a bench
yeah its been like a whole 2 minutes, way too long
‘We gotta review this play to make sure we called it correctly.... and to get in a few more commercials.'' 
I like Georgia''s band. They play some dank post scoring stuff
I love big games. The only time it is socially acceptable to eat chips as a meal.
Is this going to be a repeat of the last all SEC National Championship game?
This is more rugby than football
Yup.  I said so in the first quarter game thread before it started and was downvoted, probably by UGA and Bama fans.  This one is a real snoozefest.
Works for 2017
"Get Back" guys for coaches is so stupid. I mean, you're a grown man, can you not control yourself on a sideline? I don't buy the "oh, he's just eccentric and really intense" argument at all. It looks fucking cringey. 
Absolute snooze fest. Jags-Bills game was more exciting. 
Points are points. There will be more chances. 
That would mean he went to tech 
Or more likely a review = more commercial time
Every score I have not seen the play, it freezes and than the score is different.
"Flow of the game" maybe if it wasn't ruined by constant commercials
Georgia kicker for MVP
Blankenship is like a real life Carlos Danger
did we reach the commercial quota with 7 mins to go in the 2nd quarter?
I like football.When my team scores a touchdown, I think to myself "yes".When the other team scores a touchdown, I think to myself "no"
Let's just all be thankful we don't have to listen Boomer Sooner at any point
Yup!
They fooled us, no commercial!
fuck I wanted 7 there
This game destroys arguments to my friends that CFB is better than NFL.
Jalen Hurts has been terrible.He really needs to show something this drive.
That kicker looks like he will be in the nfl. He has goggles. That's pro level shit
Talib would snatch Fromm's chain
imagine if it was all draftkings ;)
One can only dream!

DONT YOU DARE TALK ABOUT GOGGLES LIKE THAT
Is the prez there?
Daaron Payne (there's an apostrophe in his first name somewhere).
Just sort of feels like someone outracing a storybook monster
Im convinced the Seahawks somehow cast some weird voodoo spell over all of football. Why does no one run it while within the goal line?! 
It's not worth as many sportsball points, but I guess that what they're gonna do.
Squinty.
Aha ahahaaaa
Who dat
all hand sin
This trivia round was all about whom has played for the natty since 2012. I think yall can guess I fucking crushed it.

Still waiting for an SEC east defensive struggle to end 5-2 or somethingedit: in OT
I am ok with that.
Rodrigo Blankenship is actually someone in the witness protection program. The name, the glasses, it's the only thing that makes sense
Call him a nerd all you want, he's the only one to score in the game so far 
Not sure if this has been discussed, but try watching the sounds of the game broadcast on watchespn! Feels like youre at the game without the commentators and it actually works without buffering!!!!!
SEC speed
Alright. I put on my lucky shirt and invoked the wisdom of the champions and coaches of our past. Goddamnit jalen that's all i can do. Its up to yall now.
Sweet
BAMA HERE SHOUTING
His kicker 
Fuck him- Packers fan.
Hell, temple band has an arrangement of humble in the same key as the original. Let's see a joint performance if we can get the music down there in time
Boy we got a real barnburner here.
It's this new thing where some coaches have no spatial awareness and need to be contained to the sideline because they get so worked up. It's pretty embarrassing imo.
Ok offense... The D did their part, lets do something!!!
GOGGLES
Soon enough they won't be able to get any pennies so they gotta get all they can
Before, in 1980. It was Penn State in 1982.
If it''s another Chevy “real people” commercial I''m going to off myself.
I went to my high school state game and it was the same shit. You just stand around and look at each other whenever it goes to commercial break.
What''s the TOP for each team so far?
[You've been visited by me, the Flair Fairy, so flair up or shut up, my dude!](https://flair.redditcfb.com/)
Yeah
What is with all these booth reviews? Shouldn't the coach have to challenge? Is this a special case for the championship game
Hopefully Alabama''s offense has gotten off the bus now. 
They would be down by 17+ at this point in the game
How many people will seppuku themselves if this game ends 6-0
He's my favorite college football kicker.
What are points? 
whoah... a change of possession and... NO commercial?aw shit, did I drink myself to death already?
"I'm a friendly armadiiilloo..."
Real Actors, Not People
So...is Goggles NFL-ready? Asking for a friend. 
All the northern football team fans mad because they don''t know what defense is. 
I really should have bet the under and not thought twice about it.
He just called roquan Raekwon lol
THEM DAWGS IS HELL
Now a 3 and out for Bama.
your turn D, keep shutting their shit down, let's go boys!
Blankenship reminds me of Ricky "Wild Thing" Vaughn
Bama is 1-1 this season when facing a deficit of six points or more.
Hasn't even declared but the Bucs have already announced they're taking Rodrigo Blankenship with their first 3 picks.
I literally just said that to myself before I saw this. Maybe an all-SEC NCG is a bad idea.
Except Alabama''s LSU and Georgia''s Alabama 
Yeeeeeeah.  Thanks!
That would be fun to watch
p h y s i c a l i t y 
Bench Jalen
Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz. Boring.  I'm going to sleep after this half.
Brandon burlsworth?
Worth it, even for this game.
How? Hurts won't make a throw, GA run defense is solid. 
Just listen to humble by Kendrick Lamar.
lol 3-3 at the half then 10-3 to end it :P
The true natty
Meh, ill leave it... Not proofreading on mobile is my bad
I don't mind the commercials, gives me time to check on dinner lol
WHO WOULD WIN: AN ELITE ALABAMA FOOTBALL TEAM [OR] ONE GLASSES BOI
Thank youuuuuu
No, YOU took the over. Not me, YOU.
I hate everything 
Plenty of extra time with all the commercials...
:(
>Raekwon SmithReally?
It's always acceptable if you're depressed!
Them redcoats is hell don't they
I, for one, welcome our new UCF football overlords.
Woah, that''s weird. A field goal to a kickoff without a commercial? Unexpected.

I was up at Purdue three weeks ago and it was 20 out. Haha isn''t it like -20 now lol. PS you guys win at life for having spicy chicken biscuits still. Those got discontinued in the south 4 years ago. 
some h8ers in here cant APPRECIATE good DEFENSE ^^^andevenbettercommercials
That HURTs
It looks like he was in the NFL in the early 80s
Hurts makes his runs look so effortless.  
The Bills/Colts blizzard game was the greatest game ever 
I think, did they just go straight from a goal to the next drive with no commercials?
Blankenship is a great kicker. His huge Rose Bowl kick was impressive. 
On one hand I'm like "It's the National Championship game of course there will be a lot of commercials" on the other hand I'm like "damn this is a lot of commercials."
Georgia's going to be kicking themselves for all these opportunities  they've missed.
Is Kenny Blankenship the Georgia kicker's [dad?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMY70C3ctAU) 
Theyre like binoculars so he can see exactly where he wants to kick
Wanna take that back now?
well fudge, lol
Double Damn
Oh god damnit, don''t let him do that Georgia 
Maybe Bama's kicker needs his own pair of glasses.
This isn't NFL style. NFL qb's can make passes
ESPN killed the Dawgs momentum. That commercial break is absurd
Wait? Field Goal, Kickoff, Touchback. What's missing?
Was that... A change of possession without seeing a Chevy ad? Holy shit. 
I can't wait for the 4 1/2 minutes of Kendrick Lamar playing separated by 41 1/2 minutes of commercials at halftime
I don''t this you know what in the clear means 
Yep not knowing lyrics of SSB but trying real hard. 
That would most likely require our kicker to be able to nail a field goal... I'm not convinced that'll ever happen
not I, said the Dawg
http://www.espn.com/watch/player?bucketId=2&id=3265228
57 total yards offense and 57 total minutes commercial in the first 20 mins of the game
That particular one was "Hail to Georgia"
It sucks for everyone, everywhere
ah. More argument that hurts isn't a good QB.He's a better rb
he looked like he was going for a nice stroll
And that's why you put up w Jalen Hurt's somewhat inaccurate arm.
\o
Good call.
THE BEST IN COLLEGE FOOTBALL
Comment didn''t age well 
Yeah?
Well they were stopped and had to kick a field goal too, they just missed
That didnt age well.
Helped only slightly by the 5 minute review/commercial timeout
You mean they had points and a kickoff without a commercial? 
What about when no one scores a touchdown?
Thanks you the real MVP. 
dawgs please
Fromm has a large head. 
one of the espn megacasts is commenting on all of the other ones instead of the actual game, lol
Wut now?
The crowd was absolutely roaring at the beginning. Now they're all just "meh".
Free trial of PSVue is EXCELLENT compared to ESPN
Holy shit there weren't commercials
Made one bad throw. Our Oline however needs to show up. 
Haha.
No, it really does
“It''s growing on me” lmao fuck you
Jalen Hurts about to pull a Blake Bortles.
Ball hits 2 receivers in the hands and they don''t catch it, tried to run off the end of the line when it needn''t worked all game. Super exciting. 
Georgie band needs to play Neck
This is slightly more entertaining than the last time two SEC teams played for the natty.
Only Alabama wanted Alabama in the top 4
Ya he looks nervous and his run has already became predictable 
RIP in peace

okay, that was a great run
Well, he shows his legs...
I barely feel like I did anything, but you're welcome.
I wish Gary were calling this game. Just to make it as painful as possible to watch.
good ole run stuff
Jalen!!
Shit I went to get water b/c I was expecting a commercial and missed like 3 plays hahaha
Thanks Hartucky
I mean it's impressive just boring 
Up next on Jaylen vs Georgia
Not even close to halfway yet...
What a block by 75 got up there quick 
I sure hope we don't have any touchdowns in this game
We have 17 total passing yards thru 1.5 quarters smdh
Good job on Hurts for getting out of bounds and not taking a hit.
Jokes on You, He's going to the Falcons after $ Bryant retires 
On track for 14-13 Bama, this is looking a lot like our '14 game against them, when Chaney and Pittman had us hopeful for the future.
haha I figured.Just thought it was funny.
Holy shit I got almost a full minute without lagging or skipping ahead on WatchESPN PS4 app!!
Raekwan Smith? Are they going to fuck up everyone's name tonight?

Can someone explain to me why Georgia, Grambling, and the Packers all use the same logo just with different colors? It's like a high school using a colleges logo with different colors. Like why. Can't you be creative?
Yes. 
Ask Logan Paul
15:11 UGA and 7:25 Bama
The big plus on Hurts is that he makes running for 30 yards look like the easiest thing in the world 
There should be at least ten commercials in there
Jalen Hurts in the CFB version of Tyrod Taylor. 
Has Jalen Hurts not progressed in the passing game or is this just Alabama offense?
This guy gets it. He's not bitching about the commercials of the low score. Mans is just happy to be eating chips.
Ive been watching the datacenter stream without problems and i actually think i prefer it
UGA = 15:11Alabama = 7:16
Hey, our RB, I mean "qb", did a thing
If Georgia wins this game I will stick my hand in the garbage disposal and come out unharmed
$3.50
Commercials 
Hell fucking yeah
lmao
Can we just put Jalen in at half back and get Tua in there at QB? I feel like we're trying to convince ourselves that our stud running back is actually a QB.
Talib is a bitch
Georgia's had success against this Bama Defense but all they got to show is 6 points. It could hurt them later.
But you have to come down in bounds, and a hand isn't "down". Maybe it's just semantics, but my initial reaction was to think that putting a hand on the ground isn't actually down. I think this is an instance where common sense should take precedence and I'm overthinking it with the hand being down rule. 
Well it is an SEC game... I thought we'd be in the clear but CBS fucking found us, dammit.
I don''t hate everything anymore. 
Frosty''s on the sideline.
Hurts doesn't seem like he does too much
Big gashing run like that was exactly the momentum Alabama needed...cmon defense, stuff em.
Right? The amount of commercials are ridiculous. 
Damn that hit
**BOOM BABY!**

Bottom right corner of the screen, dude.
Just run the ball
he just dipped his sack on him
Boom goes the dynamite 
Lol
blindside boi
Hurtsdontit
Over/Under at 44.5 lol. 
Sort by live is fucking useless on mobile for this game.
Woooo!!!
Missssssed tackle
Gotem 
***BELLAMY OH MY***
And he got sacked...
That was fast
If Alabama scores here, this game is over
What's really fun when you beat Bama is playing Rammer Jammer.
Humble yourself 
And that's why you don't put up with his nonexistent pocket presence.
[You've been visited by me, the Flair Fairy, so flair up or shut up, my dude!](https://flair.redditcfb.com/)
I didn''t realize I was still in the First quarter thread... 
It's like he has dementia and has to be corralled by his nurse.
Hurts is an unremarkable QB.
"Ill just hold the ball and count to 1,000."
they miss derek henry right now
The endzone is lava! 
What the fuck Jonah 
I...I think they did. Could it be...the prophecy?
If Jalen couldn''t scramble as well as he does, he''d be considered a bad QB.
*defensive battle*
Sacked from The Blind Side by Sandra Bullock.
Fuck, you had all day.
Damn Bama you are supposed to protect the QB.
cruncha muncha cruncha muncha fritos on his sub
Rip Hurts
Humble Yourself 
Is there a record yet for longest first half in football?
Who's ya Daddy!
I TAKE THE OVER!!
Commercials: Stream Flawlessly. Game: Freeze every ten seconds 
0-6 Georgia
6-0 Georgia leading
Shit, I've listened to that song a ton and never paid attention to that line. Thanks!
it is the law of the land:   if you have not won a national championship in 35 years, you must first play Alabama in the NCG and lose to them in a close heartbreaker and then beat them the next year
Get him
Hurts, you gotta know you can't just stand there
the commercial guy got let go mid game i guess.
If only he could pass as effectively.
Bama, quit being a bitch and either commit to running the triple option, or let your QB throw it. 
o no herts
[You've been visited by me, the Flair Fairy, so flair up or shut up, my dude!](https://flair.redditcfb.com/)
I am kinda letting my expectations rise a little you guys.Someone remind me I'm going to be sad.
Yeah, Hurts can''t throw downfield. And he held on WAY too long there.
WOOT WOOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Remember in the movie The Blindside where Ole Miss is good? LOL 
 #pocketpresence
I really like the Coaches fillroom as well. It's quite informative.
CALL SANDRA BULLOCK FOR THAT BLINDSIDE
Blankenship for player of the game. He's been solid in the playoffs. Yes there was an early miss last game, but he's been solid since.
So much inside holding
You can't hold on to the ball that long. Fucking dunce. 
It''s sad that he was dropped after his glasses concentrated the sun and burned down the stadium though. 
S A C K
"I'm not watching the national championship." - r/CFB*posts 20,000 comments in the first half*
I've seen potatoes with better pocket presence than that
My god Hurts is awful. You don't have all day to throw the ball.
**BOOOOOOOOOM**
Owwww
Our offense has minimal creativity and we have QB who can't throw it/can't get it off his hands. Frustrating. 
Hurts is cancer 
Even worse I have to stream the film room with the Mullet
they did run once? Oh I missed that. that D was tired should've run on them.
Flat footed. AWFUL as  qb
Hurts just sits there in the pocket and takes those fucking sacks. 
Par for the course right there, Jalen. 
MSU will get their's in a couple hours
Anytime. Keep up the good work, hoping yalls defense continues to reward it.
Bama wide outs are poor blockers.  
Well the buffering wouldn't happen if watching via regular cable, but I get ya. I gave up on app and just enjoy watching these comments in the thread.
So did I make the right choice playing Okami instead of watching the game?
How much holding are they gonna let slide. Jesus. 
K
>hit from the blindside As if he has another side right now
thats on hurts, you had plenty of time
Sack!
Hurts pocket presence is lacking. 
Bellamy in the house!
<3
Hurts doing his best Brodie Croyle impression.
Wait, are you allowed to hit quarterbacks? I thought it was 2018???
How is WatchESPN so unbelievably shitty?
youtubetv free trial!!!
Even worse I have to stream the film room with the Mullet
Should be on the bottom right of the screen. If you don't have a stream going it's 6-0 Georgia
Damn! Never had one from Iceland! 
6 minutes until cranky Saban interview
Wow lolol
So Hurts will never be a NFL QB will he?
For the amlunt of money made from these commercials alone tonight, they should pay the players. 
SACK!
Dayum! No spidey senses?
We're not going to hit 10k unless they ramp the commercials back up
Bullshit targeting rule allows quarterbacks to run like that. No fear.
Dude isn''t even moving his feet. God this is brutal, and this is coming from a neutral fan. 
Never saw that comeing
We want Tua
This is a record, more than 2 plays without a commercial. 
**Davin Bellamy you damn good Dawg you!**
What is up with Hurts standing so flat footed?
Chippy chippy 
Done.-Bellamy
Jalen meh. I feel like you are just gaslighting me right now. 
TODDDD!!!
But seriously, to those that want to know when an email address that they have has been compromised, check out https://haveibeenpwned.comIt's free, and will cover most events in this day and age.
I feel like getting some dinner and then coming back for the 4th quarter will be a better use of my time than sitting at work trying to watch a shitty ESPN stream while everyone else leaves. 
Jalen Squirts
dude got tackled and still got the sack
That's just how it works
I think Georgia is an example of when a great coordinator is also a great head coach. Their defense is reminiscent of Alabama''s defenses under Smart. 
Chippy
Great 2-play sequence from Davin.
CHIPPINESS ALERT
I don't know who to root for. maybe a sinkhole?
facemask???
SAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACK
3rd and 15? HB dive. 
This is like when lsu didn''t have a first down in the game against Alabama a few years ago
Ooooooh, chippiness 
Lol @ this Bama offense.  It's putrid.
that under looking real sexy right about now.
G L A D I A T O R M I C E 
CAT FIGHT
That''s a fucking forfeit play following Jalen doing Jalen things. 
Green Bay created it. A few years later our coach asked for permission to use it.We actually changed the dimensions of it - which led the Packers to do the same!
if these teams played the browns, what would the score be
THIS GAME IS JUST MEH
I WANT TO SEE A FIGHT
[I wish you'd flair up, my dude.](https://flair.redditcfb.com/)
Fuck Jalen Hurts I hate this dude can we please put in Tua
hurts pocket cadence is weird to me. he just kind of stands there like he's holding a beer or something
3 and 15Let's run up the middle.
FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT *kiss kiss kiss*
Brian Daboll is shitty, man. I miss the Lane Train.
Of course they run it on 3rd and 15.
That has to be 15 against Georgia
I haven't seen a sack that impressive since the locker room at the Y
Imagine the memes if Alabama gets shut out
I think I've seen 4 total plays this quarter by using WATCHESPN 
I want more hate in this game, no offense.
A fucking draw on 3rd and 15. \#FireDaboll
Both QBs are dropping _way_ too deep imo. Are the pass rushes that much better than the O-Line.
Holy shit you called it 
Good decision by Hurd not to throw to the Back on that play, sack sucks the INT would have been worse
For, like, contrast????
His name is Goggles. This is well established.
Go Dawgs
It would seem to me that Georgia would like to have a National Championship.
Saban gonna kill that kid 
How is that not a flag on Georgia. At least off-setting. 
Please don't start a fight don't do nothing stupid and shoot ourselves in the foot
Lucky flags didn't come out there.
I''m just here to watch Jeremy Pruitt get hired
FUCK DABOLLFUCK JALEN
Don't jenx it
Wow hurts held the ball and stood still? NO WAY?! 
C o n s e r v a t i v e. 
Hey guys it''s about 8:30 where I''m at right now and I''m pretty tired. Should I go to sleep now or should I stay up and watch this game? Work tomorrow btw
HUMBLE YO SELF
Ridley is actually good, and so is Ruggs...usually 
I hope you took under
Does anyone else feel like ESPN has some sort of filter on these cameras. The color isn't as vibrant as a normal football broadcast it seems. Maybe it's just the lights in the stadium
Bellamy just brutal on that sack.
It could be 100 to nothing and he'd still be grumpy. 
This looks exactly like the kinda game the Tide lose
A brick might be an improvement for sure.  
Fun fact: Alabama has been sacked this game more time than they have points
Both the score and the fighting is like a hockey game.... 
I want a cookie 
SKO JAWJA DAWHGS
Who does he think he is? JT Barrett?
Jalen Turds
Not trying to be a fasionista, but those 2018 patches on the jerseys are fucking ugly
CHIP-PY
let's go baby, another great stop after that great bama break off run, let's fucking go DAWGS!
[It's true](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ieAbJv6HlU)
Why wouldn't you even try to pass there? Cmon Bama take a chance 
me as that little scuffle happened:H8FEEDSTHEDAWGH8FEEDSTHEDAWGH8FEEDSTHEDAWGH8FEEDSTHEDAWGH8FEEDSTHEDAWGH8FEEDSTHEDAWGH8FEEDSTHEDAWG
3rd and 15? How about a hb dive
3rd and 15 and you run it up the middle? The fuck is with this play calling. 
Kirby is on a tight leash 
NOOOO
Alabama? more like every player on their team including 2nd thru 4th string could beat the living pulp out of me so I'm not gonna finish this joke
Ah fuck
someone please tell me who the dude holding Kirby's pants is lmao 
We're up 6 and I feel like we're behind. 
Halen is garbage.
No flag on those... extracurriculars?
Coaches film room is lit af
Wtf was that Bama? 
Can''t be living in the phone booth like that. It''s 2018, you gotta live outside the phone booth. 
SABAN IS PISSED
In what world is that not a penalty on UGA. Blatant grabbing of the facemask and twisting the head
They ran it up the middle on third and fifteen?No confidence whatsoever in Jalen's arm.Saban knows what we all know. Dude is awful.
I'm ready to move on from Daboll if this is the best he can come up with.
"My first read isn't there... shit im confused."
I just tried to drink a candle...
Well that''s not good... 
It''s gonna happen. 
3rd and 15. Run up the middle. What the fuck man
Jalen Hurts is not a good quarterback
Bama playing to lose tonight
Surprised flags weren't thrown for that scuffle.
No! Wims!
The lack of flags for when it get scrappy is kinda nice, at least for this game.
Hurts needs to sit out a possession or two to get his head screwed on right. 
Hurts has an unremarkable OC.Run the damn ball then play action pass.  
Jalen going into Bortles mode.  Run it.
They keep trying Chubb, but the D isn't worn enough for him yet
Georgia is just flexing on Bama right now, wowsers
They hitched their wagon to this guy.  I don't know why, but they did.
Running on 3rd and 15?
3rd and 15? Yeah, let''s run it. Makes sense. 
#P H Y S I C A L I T Y
Wims!! Noo
No no no no no
God damn you got to protect that blind side boi
Good lord, Georgia. Do not let these crimson chuckle-fucks draw you into a personal foul.
DIES IRAE INTENSIFIES
Don't fall for that, defense. 
That looks like it Hurts
R.I.P. Number 73 from Alabama
LOL. That lineman thought his job was done
*Someone gets tackled*    Sean: "He got WHACKED!"
NOBODY TALKS ABOUT MY MAMA LIKE THAT
Does he have any kids?Just wondering if there are any Smart children out there
I have no idea. Losing Kiffin might have fucked Jalen.
Add in Lee Corso's one liners from the PS2 era NCAA football games and I'd be all for it. A-A-RP says! THAT was a good play!
Fucking neck whip somebody. No penalty. The fuck is that?
GO DAWGS
God our offense is boring and predictable without a passing game
I guess that''s what you get when your o line is the best, not used to pressure
Wims to the locker room is not good
Man our D is on point! Cap it off with a TD now before the half, pretty please!!
No not wims :(
huge stop
Yeah just get in a fight during the biggest game of your life. Why the fuck not?
A RUN ON 3RD AND 15?!?!
Wims pop that bitch back in and get back out there
Please no 
Mad hicks 
Bold moves all around there 
Where is Bo? I think we need to use him more.
Bama offense is elementary school shit.  If they can't man handle the D line they are so bad
Unless you're emotionally invested I just say no
Jalen fucking standing there behind the center is what I will remember most of this season. Fuck.
Refs letting them play 
I love it when I ask the defense for a stop, and the defense gives us a freaking *stop* hahaha
Pull a Hershel and just pop back into place 
Kick Alabama out of the game. 
Saban scerred
Wimms RIP
For UGA and the Packers, you don't fuck with a historical logo like that.
I've switched my fandom from replay official's voice to the guy holding on to Kirby's pants.
JK Fucking Scott
Calm your shit, dude. You're lucky that wasn't a penalty.
Love to see a 5 minute 13 second touchdown drive here
How do you not call that a personal foul on UGA?!?!
Todd is high as balls
One of the most casual looking QBs I've ever seen. He's as relaxed on 3rd and 10 as I am checking my mail in the morning. 
No...
safety time?
Once again with the weak ass playcalling smh
Monster 
The Stars won 6-0 recently so you are correct.
There are legal ESPN streams available too, just find this all very amusing
Has anyone ever been to this stadium? How is it? 
Wims arm fell off
I'm still in shock by that sack. The fuck was Hurts doing?
Wims Nooooooo!
RUN DABOLL
Great stop after a big play.
this flair. explain yourself
Dislocated shoulder. Well see if they can get it back in
Oh my god this game sucksssss
We may eat shit, but we also eat ass ;)
TUA.  I WANT TUA.
I hate hurts. 
Roquan is a DGD
Run play on 3rd and 15? Oh no Saban what is you doing
SIT DOWN 
there doesn't appear to be...OH..I get it.  
Daboll makes it really hard to like him at all
Man, we're screwed. The defense can't carry the team all night and our offense is just garbage.
Go to bed. When you wake up, we should be somewhere in the 3Q watching commercials
And we are not even trying on 3rd down. FUCK
JK Scott is basically the best punter in college football, right?
Field position is so underrated.
1st overall to Cleveland in 2019
Hurts is not good at throwing.
You guys remember how in the NCAA games they wouldn't have players names, like it'd just be QB #12, HB #22, and such.That's how I see every Alabama skill position player not named Julio Jones
Seriously....start calling those penalties!!!
Wims?
I'm rooting for chaos, and chaos would be a final score of 6-2
Did that guy get ejected?
3 and out. 3 and out. 3 and out. 
There goes that Georgia receiver's collarbone
Botching tons of the names, who is Rayquan Smith?  
The fuck Daboll? Why would you run up the middle on 3rd & 15?
kirby looks like hes going to have a heartattack
Not next year.
let's get a fucking touchdown dawgs, come on now, cap this great 1st half with a bang
Solid punt 
Tua can't be much worse than this can he
Defensive football is when it's a close game but you feel like you're getting your ass kicked.
Nothing gets me harder than seeing Bama punt
JK "inside the ten" Scott
Shoutout to the Georgia band for blowing their fucking faces off every down. They sound fantastic. 
Lord chaos bring in Tua
Bamas punter is killing it
He''s really the son of one of my HS English teachers...still teaching at my HS...30 Years later
“Oh yeah we found your credit info and SSN and the deed to your house and your daughter''s virginity and your heavenly soul on the dark web. We accidentally leaked it. Sorry bruh” -Expedia
Kirby's handler is earning his keep
Worked well for Georgia 
I don''t think they read through these threads 
Scott is usually great but he got lucky lucky on that bounce.
So greenbay designed it and then a few years later (1964) Georgia came up with a similar logo and asked their permission and grambling did it the following year, both teams receiving permission from Green Bay 
I was excited to get Daboll at the start of the season and would be satisfied with him leaving at this point
There weren't really any great or dominating teams this year in CFB. So this is what you get for a championship
Why is there a guy who is just hold Kirby back? He is like your less drunk friend at a bar as you are trying to fight people. 
FIRE BRIAN DABOLL
I wonder how much Kirby's pants guy gets paid
It was bad in the Bills - Jags game yesterday, I cannot even imagine how it is for this thread.  
I can respect that
Cleveland would win by 60.
\>Wims\>"catching that ball"
NCAA 2005 update: My Gators get the ball at the 20 after forcing an LSU punt in Gator territory with 2:31 to go in the 1st (5 min quarters)
If I was the Georgia mascot, I would have made the fair catch signal with that punt
Blimp worthy moments? More like commercial ready moments
Jalen Hurts is like Feleipe Franks if Franks was good
Is Wims a good receiver ? 
Really, no flags on that? He was pulling him by the facemask
The coaches channel has great analysis but it''s so damn dry. You don''t even know when plays are starting if you''re not staring at the screen cause they barely acknowledge the game as it''s happening.
[removed]
WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT.... 3rd and 15 and ***we run it?***
Thats a dislocated shoulder
Please Tua time. Please Tua time. Please Tua time. 
Limited injuries all year now this shit
Dislocated 
So we''re just gonna pretend like a face mask after the play isn''t as much of a safety offense than during the play?
That shoulder is out of socket for sure. 
Do we not have running backs ?
Worked for Georgia.
Aerial coverage of a dome stadium!> They''re playing football in there!
HURTS SUCKS
those are awesome screens
Can't believe UGA's D is doing this tua team like bama
Kinda hard to be creative when your best run blocker is out and your QB is an...average...passer
How did that guy get that job as Kirby wrangler
I want to see more of the doggie 
1st one, we've gotten a warning in a couple of games
What kind of shit play call was that?
Boobies
back to back changes of possession without a commercial?I mean the lack of flames says otherwise, but I GOTTA be dead right now 
I doubt you'll see 3 defensive players standing and watching on a big run gain
Bama's offense is just garbage
THIS GAME...HAS BEEN WHAT WE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE!
At this point the Packers and Georgia are both too stuck with tradition and I doubt Grambling wants to spend the money. But yeah, shit is annoying. 
He's already a really bad passer with exceptional running ability, and magnificent ball security skills.
Sucks that Jalen is not good enough to make NFL and clear out next year but good enough where you can't go to Tua 
dawgs come on
Relying on the strength of the rest of his team, as always.
oh shit, I meant halfway for the second quarter. 
Im my opinion this is the second best Mercedes Benz dome
at least the datacenter stream on WatchESPN is not a powerpoint.  
I hope not... hopefully we're back next year, not Georgia
Those some big fucking screens
Who just went out injured?  I missed it.
Is that the same punter that played vs OSU in the sugar bowl? 
Crowd definitely with Georgia
False. And demonstrably so.[Also, flair up or shut up, my dude!](https://flair.redditcfb.com/)
/r/hiphopheads for the half-time thread
Nice 3rd down call, Daboll. You are ass, my dude. 
yeah but espn streams are garbage 
How you not throw a flag?
Maybe this drive the refs and ESPN won't kill Georgia's momentum. 
Sling tv YouTube tv
Is that a backup QB?
Because I've seen this too many times, letting Alabama hang around, and Alabama always makes good halftime adjustments
Don't be fooled guys.  Saban just wants Kirby and Co. to feel a little warm and fuzziness.  He'll surely phone up Lucifer at halftime.
The spark with Jalen has run out
also flat-footed the whole time 
Looking good!
Wow no commercials? WTF!?
Is JK Scott the whitest person, behind Forrest Gump, to play Alabama  football?
Oh God, that phrase gives me horrible flashbacks to our bowl game.
Is that body man''a sole job holding Kirby back by the belt?
Should've been a flag. GA dude held that facemask wayyyy too long. 
I wonder how much he gets paid
safety safety safety
Our o line has struggled all season tho
is he going to lose his arm
Holding that like a dislocation
I hate that kid and i hope his larynx falls out
T U AUA
First TD wins this game.
45-0 Josh Gordon
Might be because he's a dog
 I mean worked for Georgia earlier
The stadium was great. We lost to the current national champs there  
the real question is how much do you like commercials?
Judging from the reaction today, it's a bitch to get into, and the roof leaks. 
Ah yes, good overhead view.. of the roof...
Okay folks, there's obviously someone holding the AV crew at the stadium hostage. By not playing commercials they're trying to signal us. We need to send help now. 
No commercial 
Imagine being inside Megatron's butthole
Is he the backup QB?
Wims
Lol. This is a BIG crew. They don''t call holding. 
The coaches show on ESPN News is the single best piece of football television ever. They need to do more of this. 
Has Bamas offense been this anemic all year?
Love these announcers. Think NFL needs more ‘exciting'' announcers that actually react to big plays.
No matter what you'll always have the first half.
Jags-Bills : Amateur edition. 
Georgia defense is nasty.
Man just fucking out tua in its not like his pass game could be WORSE
Concessions are definitely cheap
Wims
same reason Iowa wears Steelers colors, it looks good
Well everyone dominated you. 
Can we travel to the good timeline where Clemson and Oklahoma are playing 
What happened to 6 for UGA? Ejected?
It will probably continue to be a very defensive game.
Difference, that is an exciting rout in hockey....this is booooring.
Ok you Dawgs, its first and *ninety-five.* -Munson in my head
Was that Randy Jackson?
thats pretty common tbh. You're QB can't throw passed 10 years, you really don't wanna risk 3 and 10+ this early
Power nap at halftime then bounce back.
The dominance of Alabama''s defense against Clemson really distracted from how mediocre their offense was 
It's been several minutes since a commercial. Maybe they're acknowledging our collective bitching?
It's maddening. Feet planted in concrete. 
Wims. He''s good. 
I'm very impressed by Georgia this first half. The defense is goddamn predatory. 
2017-2018: Season of the teams running it up the middle on 3rd and long
Georgia is winning. How can we spin this to talk about Alabama 
Wims
PSU's mascot woulda caught that
Chubb chubb
Yeah he almost cost his team a first-down there.  Little surprised they didn't call it.
We did it reddit, no more commercials
Starting to think Alabama has a good defense
Wims from uga
Be buff af
Careful here. DO NOT lose the ball
Coaches have zero faith in Jalen judging off running on that 3rd down. 
Joe Namath. 
Yup
Nah. You''re right. Same as the new SB logos in the NFL. They''re standardized. And sad. 
ALL THE NORTHERN TEAMS FANS MAD BECAUSE THEY DONT KNOW WHAT DEFENSE IS
Daboll gotta go 
Plz dont curse it
He's a sophomore, he's ineligible
I concur
That boy Hurts was just chilling before the sack. Wow.
Don't be.  The team needed a loss. Now they can build their intensity back up for Saturday
Tua time?
Jalen Hurts was just chilling in the pocket on that sack. 
Wtf no commercials? This is bullshit. Too much football between my precious commercialsEDIT: I can''t believe I had to put an /s
And no commercials! This is the best football broadcast I've ever seen 
Change of possession without commercial? WTF?
So the screens in the dome are set up very interesting.
Fromm can underthrow INTs and take sacks all day. Nothing.Hurts breaks huge runs with a 17:1 TD:INT ratio and play in his second National championship in his sophomore year, and rank #2 all time in Albama TDs and people wana constantly trash him when he takes sacks from behind. I wonder what the difference is. Edit: Yea, downvote the truth away you fucking assholes. 
Fucking throw the ball i played back up QB  and its was so easy to see how wide open our Tight End was
I feel jipped!
Best stadium in the US. Every seat is a great seat and the food and drink pricing is reasonable. $2 dogs & $7 beers. 
What happened? Saw him running inside briefly.
I am a Ducks fan, I am always depressed.
You...I like you
Hurts looks like old greg
UGA counting their blessings it's a big10 crew hating on bama that they didn't get flagged for that horseshit unsportsmanlike
I'm assuming to prevent a sideline warning... That's probably his one job
Really? So bad? 
Wims
Tell that to the broken oneshttps://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-sports-alabama-trophy/players-dad-breaks-alabamas-championship-crystal-football-idUSBRE83G1G620120418
How can he slap?
Wims
Daboll might get his ass chewed today as well.
Switch to the ESPNews coaches commentary during these shit commercials. Lots of amazing insights from these guys.
No, he's the S&C coach 
Yeah but too high up.  Not the best angle tbh. 
CAN UCF PLAY THE SECOND HALF? I'M BORED
Awful?
Imagine how it felt to watch football in like 1908? You could dominate all game and lose in one play.
I think "passer" is being generous.Also, I don't think Cotton is the issue here.
If the Nitanny Lion can catch a pass then Harry should be able to field a punt. Just sayin'
I'd take that job
Their defense is that good. 
Come on THICC BOI!
Throw it, ads. Run it, ads. Fall down, ads. Stand up, ads. Tackle, ads.  Sneeze, ads. Edit: Ads not adds. Smh
Everyone knows it's really Raekwon the Chef
Prolly!Or maybe it is footbul hard to tell...
Because Jalen can''t hit the broad side of a barn
Georgia has at least 14 points on the field bc they take 30 seconds to drop back
enough to where I would gladly trade jobs with him. 
Chaos = Bama win = UCF claim is legit
Help me understand -- why are we showing blimp shots of a dome?
I am expecting a huge second half from Alabama.
*looking at the spread*Hmmm
Daboll is garbage, Hurts is garbage, Papnastos is garbage.
Tua is gone anyway . . . 
oh yes! i love bulldogs too! he's cute
Those are always fun, especially for scorigami.
Wims
How you going to do the Million Dollar Band dirty like that? 
For anyone watching the Megacast, I hope that Joe has a drink at the half. He seems pretty high strung.
The main ESPN stream sucks. But try the hometown radio feed. Same broadcast, less people streaming it, plus hometown radio broadcasters instead of ESPN announcers!Other option I like is the sky cam or the sounds of the game stream. Sounds of the game is great cuz it''s the same video feed of the main stream, but all you hear is the crowd, the bands, and the PA announcer!
Dare I say, some of these bama players are looking a bit down
JUST THINK IF ALABAMA SEALED THE DEAL ON ALEX GRINCH
You''re about to get it...
Georgia 20, Alabama 0 final
Hope this guy holding Kirby Smart gets paid well
Don't jinx it
I''m not. Just casually watching. I just don''t wanna wake up in the morning to “game of the century” posts online and beat myself up for missing it
The defensive player going to Hurts says a lot about this game. Bama's defense has held up their end of the deal. Hurts needs to step up. Offense needs to step up. 
That's what you do when you don't trust your QB. 
Georgia Dome was pretty nice. Auburn can't win in the new stadium so I must assume it's shitty. Haven't been by it yet though.
I'm watching skycam and although better, it is still pixelating and cutting out now and then. But at least I don't have to listen to commentators. 
Time for a surprise field goal
Hurts makes me want to die
Both teams should switch coaching staff just to make this game interesting.Edit: I'm not saying I'm not happy with the outcome or how are boys are playing so far. I'm just saying this game is fucking boring.
Pass deep
We want TUA!!!!!
Forest gump was offsides 
Worst NFL playoff game I have seen this weekend. 
T U A UA
That was a fast 3 n out.
We just planning on kicking it?
It blows my fucking mind that Tua isn't even warming up. This is just pathetic
Shoulder injury
I'm no where near high enough for this game 
Wims
Maybe we should keep running up the middle
YouTubeTV free trail. Now you can watch the game just as smooth as all of the commercial breaks!
So uh, when does #94 for Alabama go to the NFL because this seems like child play for him
Dave Warner Esq
ads* 
It cost a lot
Technically he does complete passes
I like college football.When I see bulldog mascot, I think to myself “yes.”When I see commercial, I think to myself “no.” 
Georgia is wearing bama down
Dat halo board is sex
Who's the slow dancing blonde
I seen whut you done there.
[yes](https://247sports.com/Player/Tua-Tagovailoa-77451)
Is Georgia just doing run run pass now?
looking like it
Might depend on your location I guess. DataCenter stream has been flawless for me so far
Anyone else having problems with watch ESPN?
Georgia''s defense is ridiculous. Very impressive. NFL players everywhere it seems. Those linebackers are legit.
Open the sphincter!
Because Goodyear
His name is Jalen Hurts.
I thought he was about to pitch a tent and start pulling out the marshmallows. 
Ads
NOW we're going to run up the middle???
Yah, that was a bit ridiculous
To show that pretty Merceds Benz roof.
back to back horrible run calls up the middle
It worked for UGA on 3rd and 20. We're not so fortunate
Dude!
94 getting penetration while getting double teamed, dude is a monster
It's a repeat of the last time there were two SEC teams in the title game.  A snoozefest that nobody wanted to see to begin with.
they are so fucking fast
They couldn't even cheat their way to a division title.
Serious to God if my team wasn't playing I'd be getting in the bed right now. 
I think it's an ACC television affiliate
Bama's 94 is going to get flagged tonight
Hurt shoulder
Didn''t realize the Jags-Bills game was still going. 
It''s damn amazing. Went for ATL soccer and the food is super cheap. 
Every time they show the Georgia locker room door part of me wishes someone would bust out of there like Bill Goldberg would. 
It''s stock footage from the 1996 Olympics. Just ESPN cutting costs.
Because the blimp won't fit inside the done.
Georgia 6, Alabama 0
Injured, I think
Yeah, quick amputation, then get back out there.
*runs ball at the defense*Nothing? i know just what to do they'll never see it coming*runs ball at the defense again*
on his fucking heels.  ZERO competence as a passer
Because new stadium... Also gotta show that Benz logo.
i SEE WHAT YOU DID THERE.
I need to be told what to think and buy!
Alabama's offense in this game reminds me a lot of LSU in the 2012 BCSNCG. 
[yes](https://247sports.com/Player/Tua-Tagovailoa-77451)
Sometimes he is to comfortable back there. 
Sounds like a good idea
Elephant?
Fire Daboll
"trying to spread Alabama out"Two runs up the middle
Hurts isn't playing well but Daboll isn't doing him any favors
Daboll is not the problem 
Is anyone else''s channel just cutting out repeatedly 
EZ
Why are we trying to run up the middle?! Fucckkkk
Yeah we do until they get tired....
I'm cheering for Georgia only cause i think bulldogs are cute.UCF is the real champ anyway
*jalen
It can go one of two ways, UGA gets another field goal and Bama scores a TD but misses PAT. Or Bama gets TD, misses PAT and sacks Fromm in the end zone.From my perspective either will be fine.
Looks like a shoulder injury. 
Wow, this game sucks.
I am and it's not making it any better 
nice pass!
But I thought Georgia had no chance, ESPN talking heads?I wonder what Lavar Ball thinks?
Battle of the defenses. Georgia is killing our offense. 
How do you run against that look?? That's insane you've got 5v7 in the box and 3v2 on the outside.
20? That's generous.
That was a fucking dime from Fromm
This game is boring af 
LET'S GO BABY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This game would have been way more fun with Oklahoma playing, regardless of the opponent.
they'd honestly get more views if they just dedicated a channel to a film room during random CFB games
What a throw
great throw
Well after he stood there holding the ball for 3 hours the play before, can you blame them?
WATCHESPN'S CODE WAS WRITTEN BY UNIVERSITY OF IOWA GRADUATES. TRY ESPN'S DATA CENTER STREAM: http://www.espn.com/watch/player?bucketId=2&id=3265225
Why does Kirby have a staff member dedicated to holding his belt? Did he have an issue with get penalties for being on the field too much last season?
RILEY IS THE SUPERIOR RIDLEY!
Is anyone using WatchESPN having massive pauses with 2-3 seconds of actual video in between?
Nice
So you can see that sweet Mercedes logo
i actually would edit the starters and put their names in haha
Looks like going into the locker room for X-rays
rub some sand on it
Clearly you didn't watch bills and jags then
you wouldn't classify this as bad offense?  Did you see what OU was able to do to the Georgia D?
The SEC Network broadcast is really good.
That''s a fucking back breaker 
I can breathe again. 
RIDLEY JR
Hopefully at the half Bama can round up a few scoops and start getting their shit together. 
What's the score?
What a dot! 
great fucking throw Fromm
It's apparently leaking
How does one get the duty or job to be the sole responsible person to hold the coach's waist back so he doesn't run on the field all game? 
FACEMASK
Gotta be drunk on moonshine to understand the intricacies of what we are witnessing. 
Who gets the ball to start the second half?
god dammit
So we can see the leak.
Ridley > Ridley 
Wait. When did Georgia get the ball? Fuck ESPN. I can't tell what's going on
Who gives a fuck about third down, right? I mean it's not important at all.
Georgia “3rd & Long” Bulldogs
SEC vs. SEC championship games are terrible
Da'Ron Payne is balling.
What is 3rd down defense?
Daisy Ridley!
Fromn can step up when needed.
That boy Fromm is D E A L I N G 
wait...SEC teams are allowed to pass!? since when!?
94 is a goddamn boss
3rd and Bama strikes again!
Nauta has one of the worst tats I've ever seen
ESPN has talked a lot about boxes and phonebooths tonight when a majority of viewers have never seen a phonebooth
THEM DAWGS IS HELL
I like you.
What the fuck happens to the Tide defense b/w 2nd and 3rd down
Fromm is looking impressive so far
Big throw. Punting from the endzone in this game would be very bad. 
1 hand = 1 footComing down in bounds and being down are two different things.
This Bulldog QB is pretty good.
I went from scared of a safety to happy about a great catch.
Nice throw
Yall
Fucking predicted it. Easy prediction but whatever
Thanks for that John Madden. Now to Ollie for the weather.
My wife and best friends are at the game getting loud.  I'm at home with the kids.  I'm getting BJs for the next decade.
As a UT fan, please stop trying to run it up the middle
Fromm playing like my quarterback on NCAA 14
No pressure equals 3rd down conversion.
Ballsy as fuck
That UGA O-line is killing it
Because we put a big ass glass window there and you're going to like it. Also the roof opens
No, but i tried streaming earlier and it was dogshit
Flair checks out
Hurts is a terrible thrower, that's the difference. He's the worst throwing Bama QB since John Parker Wilson 
We can''t all give up 54 points.
RIDLEY!!! YESSS!
great pocket pressence there hot dam, lol
39 is straight ass
Please let the answer be Halftime.
http://c8.alamy.com/comp/BPH5A2/rhys-ifans-the-replacements-2000-BPH5A2.jpg
Bama
We do 
Bama 3rd down defense isn't scaring anyone.
How the fuck is Fromm a true freshman 
Ads*
I do not have a college team. I just watch for fun plus I like football. 
Beer supplies low. Whisky supplies low. Morale low. Darkness settling in. 
God, I can't wait till Jalen is gone. 
Those two were necessary for the linebackers to open up for the receiver
Bama
Calvin who?
Eh I'm cross faded so 
Not sure. Shoulder problem. Saw him jogging to the locker room and that''s it
Daboll gonna get the full Kiffin treatment during halftime
YEAH DAISEY RIDLEY!
Man what the fuck, I want GA to win...but Bama has the ball, they get a nice run. I go the bathroom and GA has the ball again...Come the fuck on someone do something.
Jake "Tom Brady" Fromm
cos it looks cool?
yes the only advantage is that you miss about a third of the commercials.
Bama
Bama
I see what you did there
I think we should have another zone read that gets stuffed for 2 yards...
"hey bro you know whatd be funny? Lets switch jerseys and play like that"
So that's what a Ridley does with a QB that can pass. 
1 td and you're winning.  why would u  put in tua?!?
Oooooooh! Ridley!!!
Except we beat them
Can''t get off the field on 3rd down what the fuck
**mother FUCK the WATCHESPN APP**
What happened to our 3rd down D?? 
Fromm > Hurts
Watching Tressel hold that sumbitch up and give the Best Damn Band In The Land speech with my dad is a memory I''ll never forget.
Bama.
if ya'll don't put him in, you're gonna lose this game.
Bama''s gonna lose. Fuck me.
One has a QB. One has an RB.
Bama
How did I not know Ridley's brother was on Georgia before today...
Thest teams suck. Theyd lose to the Browns.
Had to step away. Did I miss any commercials?
This is Riley's breakout game
Wonder what Calvin thinks of his brother doing so well atm. Must be bittersweet.
Fuck Ajit Pai
Dude gets animated. Also it''s pretty hilarious. 
Sure he is. 
Eh, sorta. It's basically been a tale of two Jalens all season. If he looks good, we score a load. Otherwise, not so much. 
Mother fuck jian yang 
Loving all these different ESPN megacasts. Why doesn''t the NFL do something similar for the Super Bowl 
0-0
Payne sucks
Lavars going to sign UGA to BBB
Clutch catch by Ridley, that was pretty behind him 
Because good year paid for a sponsorship
Bama
Just wanted to appreciate how few breaks there's been in the last half of the quarter 
Riley's coming out party.
Georgia with the fearless play calling 
Fromm is a freshman. That's crazy. Dude has so much poise
You see Daboll, that is a crossing route.  It doesn't require the WR make 10 cuts before catching the ball.
Yeah. Just concerned that I might miss a good one. I might just say eff it and go to bed. I have no rooting interest
Obviously. That's why I said would be. 
QB play certainly isn't stopping Georgia Fromm winning this game
I have an aggie friend talking shit right now.... uhhh
She hot tho
Auto parts
Ummm....ESPN is calling Alabama's Defense on 3rd and long before it happens. Anybody else see this as problematic?
That play is not working.
Those deep crossing routes over the middle have been working well
Bama
so when are we going to get to see this Tua dude we've been hearing so much about
Bama
You have a freshman QB shredding the defense while you have a sophomore QB who can't do shit. 
Fromm baby pls
Stop running between the tackles, right at Payne! It's literally the *teeth* of their defense.Also, Riley Ridley/Jake Fromm for days......our future is bright, ladies and gentlemen.
FROMM YOU GUN
Yep. I like the Georgia radio stream, the main announcer has a great voice
I would agree with you, but I saw a how it is made on this stadium and the roof moves 
UGA's 3rd down offense is the difference in this game 
Bama is killing it first and second down and has been terrible on third and long
Damn 32 blew ole boy up
Riley Ridley is such a great name 
Fromm is killing it so far.
scratch that play yo, lol 
Bama receives.
Oregon State is terrible
Cool, man.
The sky cam stream is so fucking sick 
Sounds like you''re familiar with old school PSU football.
Are people actually watching this _second_ SEC championship game? Pft...
After watching this, I think we can all agree UCF is better than either of these two teams. At the very least, they are way, way more entertaining to watch. 
Can't stay on the field either... Reminds me of last year
Jake Fromm's a freshman, right? Damn.
Converting third downs is nice.
Fromm looking like Brady damn
Ridley stepped it up today
47 get out of the effing game
Whoa whoa where''s Kirby''s handler??
I wonder how UCF's national champions party is going?
Ridley!!!!!
They should just get rid of the play to 47.  Fromm can't throw it.
Saban has to be furious with these third down pick ups. Would hate to be on the other side of his headset.
second half is going to be real interesting 
I go to PSU, girlfriend is from jersey
They need to throw out that FB pass play to the right.
i never want to see another screen pass again after this past weekend
THICC BOI!
For the best. Got rid of Mac and Nuss. This season was a success regarding the future.
You have the most Georgia username I''ve ever seen. Kudos. 
Pat Fitzgerald is what a football coach should look like
Can I get another angle on that hit?
Yes, I switched to the Data Center stream and it went away.
How the fuck is Fromm a true freshman. I mean are you fucking kidding me? 
Ai Chubb niggaurath! 
that kind of helmet that Nick Chubb wears is so ugly.
They are preventing that from happening.  Kirby would be in the huddle otherwise.  
You guys do
Yours will be catching from Dak Prescott soon enough 
Has ESPN ever had a stream that didn't absolutely blow? I can't watch for more than 3 seconds without buffering.
Link?
17 passing yards. That is unacceptable.
What is this third down defense? We blitz on 3rd down, not rush four and give Fromm forever to throw. 
Fromm is the real fucking deal. Goddamn 
Riddled with problems. Haven't been there but I'm local. Garth Brooks concert was the first one there. I almost went. Turns out lots of people couldn't hear Garth. The roof won't open and close like it's supposed to. In fact, there's threads saying that it is leaking onto the UGA 20 yard line tonight because of the rain. My cousins are there so I'm looking forward to what they say.
HIGHLIGHTS SO FAR: 1) Kirby wrangler2) glasses kicker 
I'm amazed no timeouts have been used yet.
So damn boring. All of Bama''s championship games are just boring. This isn''t as bad as that ND snoozefet a few years ago, or maybe it is.Aaaand husband just fell asleep.
That pass play looks very familiar. Keep going back to it if they can't cover it.
Wallace has been giving up plays all game. 
Go to the sky cam or the lebatard show.
On what planet? 
I'll allow it
Our coaches are too stubborn to do it. I guess we just lose 
You gotta negotiate for some ass too my man.
i bet a UGA-OU game would be spectatular
Run UGA! *Run!* We need you to run! Pass; bad! 
Completely agree
I actually won't be super bummed if Alabama can't win this one.  I'm more-so surprised and impressed that we made it as far as we did this year to be honest.
"Is this a football? " That Alabama player
This is the Georgia that put up 54 on us. Funny what defense can do to a game.Obligatory: FIRE MIKE STOOPS
I'm very impressed with Fromm's poise as a freshman on this stage. When he's a junior, he's gonna dominate college football. 
How about that boy Ridley coming in clutch
Alabama is like the Patriots of college football. 
[deleted]
Fuck you errrrich!
Second time that play has failed 
The whole auto load of comments on the reddit app is garbage or updates too fast and I can''t see shit. Why ruin the new comment that updates when you refresh. Garbage app. 
Brick by brick
After halftime maybe?
They need to just put him on a leash like a yard dog
Should have stocked up on alcohol before the game. 
#ITS COLD
28-3
I do not fancy the bulldogs of Georgia
Impressive he stayed strong in the pocket 
Liquor store run during the half is likely necessary.
LMAO
Wins
Neither of these teams is at Disney World, so who are the real winners?
Dawg missing their # 6 injured wideout.
He's probably happy for him, I would be if it was my brother. 
What a throw
Way fewer ads
Hey, another year is fine, then he can be Matt Bryant's successor. 
I think it's more a case of the Georgia D closing down really well
Lol can we move down the field pls
another huge 3rd down, let's get it dawgs
12-2?
1) Be an intern2) Be Strong3) Have the balls to take accidental elbows to the face
ESPN can use the 6.5 M they were paying Gruden to upgrade their servers.
Is it just me or is Bama getting chippy?
Is tomorrow a holiday? Asking for my liver. 
"Wow!" I love the coaches room.
Bama defense gonna be gassed, they just cannot get off the field.
The difference in motivation and intensity between the two sidelines was night and day 
come on baby!
We have non-team flairs if you're interested. Team chaos perhaps? Team meteor if you are feeling particularly negative?
A lot of coaches have one now
Throw us some croots for unlimited bourbon
lmao noThese are elite defenses. UCF would score 10 
That would be Daboll...
They don't need them with the amount of TV time outs.
Alabama looks very low energy, sad! They need to go to bed!
True freshman. Only 19 years old
We could've had the Baker Mayfield show but instead we get the Rodrigo Blakenship show. Thanks for your terrible third quarter play calling Lincoln. 
I normally complain about leaky college defenses, but this is getting ridiculous the other way
Totally a pick missed 
Ridley you are betraying your family
Didn''t even realize that...wow
Riley is the best Ridley brother 
Easy to make those passes when you hold our guy by the freaking throat!Edit: when he game is posted online, I''ll be sure to link it.
Same 
He hasn''t been used much by us. Better options for primary receivers and he''s just a freshman. 
Except Tom Brady is at least mostly likable 
When he transfers
surprisingly, no
The advertisers all went broke
Hahaha very true. Haven't seen Jaleel white in years though.
For some reason Kirby doesn't like using them in the first half
Payne is not having the best night of his life. Although "Payne" is a badass name for a FB. Here comes the Paaaaaaaaain! NVM, he dropped it. 
How much money do I have to donate to have my voice heard bout Daboll being not good for us?
Yeah, felt like major deja vu
Why would it be problematic?
You're right. I take it back 
Last game of the year, Brent. Can''t hold anything back now. 
I haven't watched a ton of Georgia this year, but I can already see NFL teams frothing at the mouth to get Fromm.
They''ve been pretty... Smart... about it, haven''t they?
I can deal with commercials. Thank god the refs are letting them play. 
Kid's good. Will be AJ McCarron-esque. Probably better.
#**SEAL IT WITH FLEX TAPE!**
Spicy Chicken Biscuits?
Watch the film room if you can there are way less commercials. They breakdown the plays then.
Was WatchESPN ever good or has it always been this shitty?
Yep. *They're in there.*
Every time they say 'Michel' I think of the scooter scene from dodgeball
Tiddies
these slants to the middle killin this def
Practice makes perfect. And Alabama's dbacks have plenty of practice getting burned by Ridleys in practice.
Switch to the SkyCam feed. There''s no commentary but it streams fine. 
Subscribe
My dad is asleep too Lol. 
Because it's Bama doing the punting or because JK Scott is so good?
does anyone actually read through these threads tho
This fuels the UCF narrative.
Calling Jalen good is a bold statement
Riley Ridley and Jake Fromm scare the shit out of me now. Don''t want to see them in the next three years.
hi im jake from state fromm
Wins
Georgia is the same color of Knuckles and they're currently winning. Just gonna put that out there.
Btw just because Im not often on this sub:Are we all agreement that NCAA 14 is the greatest sports video game ever?
What a shitty throw 
Guys my girlfriend wants to have sex right now what do I do
This game doesn't seem much like a natty tbh 
Wow. Alabama only has 17 passing yards. They're lucky they aren't down by much more at this point. 
good punt needed
Fuckin finally
1 score done != going to lose
Hurts > Fromm
That's the situation for me too, I've even had to abandon the data center because it was freezing too much. Absolutely infuriating they couldn't get this figured out for this giant game they paid out the asshole to broadcast
He makes it look Eason
Wims
Hot take:  Jake Fromm is a pretty good quarterback.
Oof he was wide
Does that make Georgia the Steelers?
ouch, 1st bad throw by Fromm
Fromm needs to settle in
just a little off smh
Big if true
I dont even like Christmas anyways.
Twolves up 94-55 over Cavs in 3q in shootyhoops.  Just an fyi during commercial fest
I''d like to buy a 5* QB from the dawgs, please. 
UCF DOESNT THROW IT AWAY LIKE THAT
AAAGGGGHHHHHH
The ESPNU megacast is amazing. The LeBatard show, LA and NY groups are all facetiming each other live.
ESPN servers are so bad that they are eating EA server's ass
The FCC has supposedly laid the groundwork in Nov of last year for the spectrum to make it happen, but it could be another year or two for broadcasters to actually start.https://www.engadget.com/2017/11/16/fcc-paves-way-for-4k-over-the-air-tv-broadcasting/https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/2/14488608/4k-tv-broadcasts-ajit-pai-atsc-3-hdr
Calm down Jake
Oh god, don't remind me...
Bortles'd that one up
Georgia's OC trusts the true freshman to throw for it on third down inside his own ten. Bama OC doesn't let Hurts throw it on third and long in Georgia territory
Dilly Dilly!
Yes
Wims
First bad throw by him 
Defense-solid as usualOffense-liquid shit in big games as usual
We got off the field on 3rd down!!!
But can he see why kids love the taste of Cinnamon Toast Crunch?
Hi, I'm Alabama's defense on 1st and 2nd down and I have Directv.And I'm Alabama's defense on 3rd down and I have ebola.
Shit that''s not going to get it done Fromm. 
These QBs aren't much for passers tonight.
right? Using their app legitimately and it suuuuuucks
Booooooooooo
I had no issues last year. This year has been abysmal.
So who scores more tonight, Bama or Kendrick?
sigh..
Damn that throw was a heartbreak 
I would not want to be in the bama locker room at half. 
Put in Tua for one drive. Just one drive to see what happens.
I wanna see that hardman jr
That''s not a true statement
Picked the local school team.
Or...They can use it to line their own pockets in Disney dollars. Just being realistic. 
Disney happened. It was much better. 
*jalen
reddit is fun for android.That's the name of the app. 
Y'all are saying it's boring, am I the only one who enjoys a defense battle? 
Guys, I just realized this is the last CFB game until later this year. FUCK :(
From his grave?
Wims
i think last year's was pretty exciting
Jake Fromm sometimes looks like a Dude, but then sometimes he looks like a dude who was in fact playing in high school last year.
I know. 
It was good when it was espn360. 
Georgia up 3 scores if Fromm could hit his guys a little more often
2nd quarter going twice as fast as the first. we need to get this under control
That was a bold choice, Cotton
It was good when it was espn3, but now it''s trash 
My boy Rodrigo bout to drill this 92-yarder
Didnt see how everything went down in the stats but I do believe the majority of that was the pop pass to Robert Foster early right?
Both QBs are bad. At least Hurts can run. 
"The ruling of an incomplete pass, is being reviewed"
Minus a great quarterback.
I get that Fromm is a freshman, but he's playing in the national championship. Everyone can assume he has a good relationship with his coaches and the coaches aren't keeping him away from any plays.Herby just loves talking about him like it's week 1-4
T U A T I M E^^plsUATIME^^pls
Eh, it's good enough for the college football second place game.
Hello, I'm Cliff Pawwwl
Ridley is niiiice
We know
thank god, we don't need another commercial break
Offense is at such a premium this weekend 
Georgia just can''t hit 47 in the flat. 3rd miss tonight. 
Go. This game is boring AF.
Tell her it's almost halftime
Games like this are why I watch the NFL
It's that guy from UCF 
It's only good when you're watching a game no one is watching
Which is 10 more than Alabama so far 
Dey know da wey
HE LOVES HIS MAMA!! 
B1G has good refs
UCF is already national champion, this is just a SEC charade.
Every day is a holiday if you try hard enough
Biggest college football game of the year and the watchESPN app is like I'm watching the stream on a first gen iPhone on a submarine. 
"It was behind Hardman"hehe
Fromm is so bad.   but he's doing better than Hurts at least.
You mean we're going to come back in the last quarter to beat a team from Georgia in the Championship? 
They would have had to custom make a helmet big enough to fit Baker Mayfield's head if he made it to the NC game
tell her to pm me
Can you say block in the back?
This should be Tua time
The difference is when we play the best teams and our defense has a tough time and gives up points and puts us in passing situations, Jalen can''t create explosive offense
Because he's way better
The legendary hold-back guy. Just the lowest paid grad assistant
Por que no Los dos?
Dump her
Commercial break.
On iPhone 
For the love of god please keep the coaches room up for Kendrick Lamar 
Brian Daboll needs to call a shot here 
It's never good, but with the traffic of tonight, this is the worst it'll ever be
Quickie
They found da wey
her
WHY ARE THEIR WRS SO OPEN
Fromm has to shake that throw off, if he doesn't it's Clemson all over again
Fromm has thrown a LOT. That''s scary. 
Riley ridley.  Just flows. 
How? Ucf would get destroyed by either team. 
Watch your language, Incognito.
G A M E O F T H E C E N T U R Y
Offense has to put up a drive here. 
Underrated comment of the night 
Half time. It'll be a long one. Hit it. 
Take one for the team
"UGA *has* to stay out of 3rd and long." Uga: 4-8 on 3rd and 6+. Ehhhh, I'll take those numbers so far.
I just realized Cavin is Calvin without the L, so he took the L out of his last name to get Riley 
how?
Any chance you could link one of those for me? I would really appreciate it
Lol. 
Most obvious block in the back of all time
VERY timely flag for us. 
It was good when it came out, but that was relative to other streaming services. Seems like they've never updated it
Don't you have friends? 
terrible pass jesus, lol.
Huge, obvious penalty 
Lol I think I saw two penalties on that one
Fromm needs to make the open throws.
Wow, two blocks in the back. Dirty shit
Raquan Smith love the hustle on special teams 
You have all off season for sex.
But they're at a Kendrick Lamar concert. 
NCAA 2005 Update: My Gators go for it on 4th & 8 at the LSU 35 (3 yards out of FG range for me) and don't convert so LSU gets it back with 0:43 left in the 1st with the score 0-0
Clearest block in the back you'll ever see folks
Dammit Fromm just missed him
Holy shit both of these QBs suck.
College Football and Knuckles? 
How did I miss the hometown radio feed? Thanks! 
54-48
> Alabama''s looking to get points here. Oh, really?
Original Tony Hawk, but its close.
I'd watch that too instead of a shitty Cal team.
Have sex during one of the commercial breaks. Likely you won't miss much. 
Fromm is pretty good 
A wild Tua is spotted on the turf
Holy fuck Bama stop with the dumb shit on punts
That is a TERRIBLE flag
Is she single?
Jesus christ, watch ESPN is literally so fucking terrible. 
Multiple blocks in the back 
I'm rooting for no more scores because a 6-0 ending would be hilarious
Either way you get fucked
3rd and long right where they want us.- it's 3rd and 5+???? Here have 15 yards. You're backed up in you're own endzone? Have 5 more.
Jesus... bringing up that again? My wife still gets mad about that game.
Well, thats kinda a given, she has needs too
Dumb ass 
Here they come, rougher than the rest of 'em
Set your phone right on the small of her back and go to town
What an idiot.  That illegal block was seen by everyone in the country.
A wet paper bag could stop Alabama''s offense right now
Dey kno de wey
How many 3rd & longs is that for GA? Sheesh! 
Fun Fact: Mizzou dropped 21 on Georgia's defense in the first half of their game.
Defense wins championships
I've gotten better steams out of the acc network with friggin amateurs broadcasting than I ever got from watchespn
Yeah that''s gonna be a block in the back. 
You crossed the 50.  Small victories...
Did you miss the last two against Clemson?
Salty Saban in T-minus  2 minutes and counting
Well that was a penalty
Nope
I wouldn't say Fromm is bad 
These 2 teams both playing like when Auburn destroyed them. 0 offense
My 8 year old nephew could have thrown that flag. Jesus. 
This game is rather boring so far tbh
I don''t normally watch college football but based off of this game I don''t think that Hurts is very good.. 
Would definitely be more entertaining with them. 
How young do you have to be to have never even seen a phonebooth in the wild? 15?
We need six commercials to sort this out.
You wear visors?
Always sex... you can DVR
Block. In. The. Back. Every. Single. Punt. Return.
I like the 2018 jersey theme.
Gundy dancin?!
No one cares 
I prefer defensive games.
Noiiiiiiiiiice
You wont miss much at the end of the half go right ahead
really? I thought both games with Clemson were legit. 
holdem here to no points dawgs, let's go
What will happen on February 18? Why both teams have 2 18 on their jerseys? 
Game on in background, doggystyle. 
The former, sorry pal
It''s crazy how well UGA is playing even though Fromm is playing kinda poorly 
ALL BIG 12 FANS GETTING BORED SAY YEAAAAAH
I can't tell if you're serious or not
You aren't missing much
The patriots have a QB though aka the G.O.A.T from TTUN
I really wanted to see LeBetard's group only. Not revolving commentary and a minimized screen.
Dang it I burned my mouth with a hot weiner
Fromm is trash but so is Hurts lol 
Hometown calls on ESPN3 are great and don't have the presidential levels of stability the main stream displays.
MLB the Show 08 and NCAA 06 are better
Since the SECCG, I think I've seen one hold call in every Georgia game 
Tua time?
Let's get a touchdown on this drive!
Calvin would have a TD if our QB could hit the broad side of a fucking barn. Calvin absolutely abused the UGA DB
You'll be back in like 15 seconds, you won't miss much.
Thanks ref 
Yah Calvin is great rite.
I hope Bama wins, then maybe there''s a chance their punter will be named MVP. That would be legendary. 
been like that for big games for years now.  It's embarrassing honestly
Always been shitty. Especially for any important games. 
Was that the long snapper who just drew that block in the back? My boy fucking HUSTLED after that snap 
A real man doesn't have to think about this^^^^^^SexBecauseIHaveNone
These low scoring defensive struggles seem to feed on themselves. The defense does well, so the offenses play conservative, so the defense starts to suffocate their vanilla play calling.Gonna be a long second half.
Nice head of hair on that ref
Go during the next break
You mean this isn't golf!?
I want the OK / GA game again
Goggles is Daddy now
You're not missing much. Unless you like commercials.
Have sec!Edit: Or sex. Either of the two.
2 blocks in the back there jeez
I've been watching for 15 minutes and don't think I've seen an actual play in real time.
not some ESPN people
Helps when you get a "go to the front of the line" pass directly to the CFP on brand alone
This is getting out of hand. Now there are two of them!
Is the ESPN hometown stream open without a cable sign in? 
It'll still be 6-0 when you're done
Man, you gotta make that throw. Now Alabama has a chance to score before the end of the half.
Has Alabama even had the ball? Every time i look up Georgia has the ball, i think I''ve seen bama run one play.
If every punt has a BitB they need to be changed
Is it ~~Tonga~~ Tua Time?I think it's ~~Tonga~~ Tua Time.
lol that bad?
I enjoy a defensive battle. This is more of an offensive slop fest. Dropped passes and missed throws galore.
Take it, the game will still be here when you get back
But our kickers are all so good!
That's not relevant
Seems to be a defensive duel so its up to you
UCF is the one true champion. Scott Frost is the one true God. /r/unza 
SEC Championship Pt 2
The hottest of takes.
hahaha
Its a hidden commercial for Mercedes and Goodyear though so we're all supposed to be excited about it. 
What exactly was boring about the Alabama vs Clemson NC games?
Alabama has run 20 plays this half.TWENTY. #NationalChampionship #RollTide
Anyone uhh... anyone got a stream? /r/cfbstreams had everything removed
Uhhh, neat.[You've been visited by me, the Flair Fairy, so flair up or shut up, my dude!](https://flair.redditcfb.com/)
FIX YOUR MIC BRO
GREG COTE IS REPORTING IN THE MEGACAST, I REPEAT GREG COTE IS ON SCENE.
My ears
Boring game
They''re good dawgs bront
CFB is all Alabama has, dont say that here!
How is that a question? You turn the TV on in the bedroom.
This isn't a good advert for College Football
this is the runners up game
I don't know what you do for work but this game is so bad, I'd rather beaking money at work. 
... that Bills Jags game was even worse.
Have an upvote for eloquence RTR
Hmmm, did you watch that Bills-Jags game?And there are just as many commercials in the NFL, too.So I'm not really sure what you mean...
True like the jags vs bills game lol
A bit of feedback there buddy...
Mic is being fucky, cut to commercial
Wtf man, this is like when you get done hooking up with your ex and she says “We can''t do this again.” Don''t even bring that up
leave
This game is literally putting people here to sleep.
My EARS

 I miss the buff official from last year 
Throw all the hats!
Is that ref gonna pick up his hat or what
Sloppy. Fucking sloppy.
Was I the only one that saw the crazy Georgia player pulling # 6 for Alabama''s facemask?
pls bama lets score
I feel like their streams were solid like 2 years ago. Even last year. Wtf happened??
OH NO WHERE AM I
That reverb mustve been murder in the stadium cause it sure fucked my ears up
Holy fuck fix that shit mic.
OU would have smashed Alabama back to 2001.
Bro turn off your fucking ufo radar
I read that as Owen Wilson, they needa dub in his “wow” after good play
We cannot fucking win when pur QB has 17 yards at the half. put Tua in fuck.
It's almost halftime so you got time 
[deleted]
Hurts has to be benched, Alabama can't do anything
Uhhhh did anyone think Bama had the edge on special teams?? Besides their punter
Points? In *my* SEC?
I'd be very proud, regardless of outcome. Playing sports against my younger brothers, I always played to win, and routinely beat them 21-0 in everything when they were very young. Even when they were getting competitive, I felt nothing but pride when they started to make threes, hit holes while running, or throw curves and field well.
uhm.... Are we watching the same game? Fromm is clearly capable of making great throws just needs to be consistent (which will come with experience). Hurts literally can't throw 
Wait halftime isn''t even inside the stadium? Wow.
Why is there a half time show 
FEEEEEEEDBAAAAACK
Please fix the refs mic
Sorry watching on the app on my ps4 
So what's the penalty yardage for massive feedback on the ref's mic?
that penalty is Ack...cepted.
You guys ever just crave string cheese?
Hurts is eventually going to have to do something for the Bama passing game. No way they can win this game with such dismal passing. 
That''s a bullshit statement. 
Alabama has done well to only be down 6
Wait, the halftime show is outside the stadium? The hell?
I just wanna say fuck watch espn
I feel like to be a successful ST coach you just have to teach everyone on your unit not to block in the back.
ref sounds like the conductor from polar express
At this point is on daboll for the lack of Alabama offense. 
KENDRICK LLAMA
Even some shitty Monday night games have been trash on that app. fuck espn. 
Bama trying to set the record with 10 consecutive blocks in the back on a punt return 
Bama pls
I have a brick at centennial. Thanks Mom!
This ref's mic is routing through outer space.
“Fromm''s first bad throw” ... I mean, if you ignore the first drive of this game
T U AUA
Kendrick lamar! Woot
Stahp watching, boycott CFP!
penalty is acksepted
Switch to the ESPN News broadcast. It's much less trafficked and has awesome head coach commentary from a panel of six coaches. I'm having zero interruptions, and as a bonus, it has less than half as many commercials as the main broadcast.
Nah that money''s going straight into Disney''s “Buy a Major ISP” piggy bank
It's like a sad handjob that you can't climax to
You're not wrong Harvard.
Except you could say the same about that bortles vs Peterman NFL game and cfb
Pretty solid officiating so far. 
crazy Fromm is a true freshman. kid has all kinds of poise
Their All-22 stream has been amazing for me
Ain't nobody got time for legal special teams play.
I've been screaming that most of the game.  Hopefully after the half.
Nah old school PSU football is *runs ball at defense**gets penalized**runs on 3rd and 15**blames Christian Hackenberg*
wait the halftime show isn't even inside the stadium?!
So far all sec championship games have sucked pretty badly. Very boring game to watch
Normally I'd think Saban would flip out during halftime, but tonight he is just going to drown the players in his tears.
Anyone else hearing the atrocious high pitched whine whenever the ref talks?
I want this game to end 9-6, so the sub will be filled with UCF championship posts tomorrow. 
This is a battle of kickers. Unless there's a lot of snow, that's not awesome for the neutral.
It's not a punt return in college without a block in the back penalty. Unless it's a fair catch of course.
Holding... ^^^number81 number 81
The halftime show is outside the stadium? lol wut?
Big Ten football has spread everywhere
Special teams is shit, except for Scott.
We the superbowl now boys 
I didn't think I'd say it, but I would rather it be OK/GA again too
Wait really!?!? Holy fuck I thought he retired 
This half is going to last about 2 hours lmao
These boys need to wake the hell up 
Right 
WAIT WTF KENDRICK ISNT PERFORMING INSIDE???!!!
/r/Recursion 
That penalty is axe-cepted
Is Bama's offense struggling again?
Ref starting to learn that illegal block in the back and pass interference don't have the same signal.
This game is way more stressful than the Auburn game. Alabama is just insane up front. 
defense please
Axe-cepted.
Lame... Could it at least be both? Please?
Yes Chris, I''m sure you''ve been waiting on Kendrick''s performance  for a long time 
how is the halftime show not in the stadium? odd.
Revenge streak starts now NeverForget2015
The halftime show is outside the stadium? That's a bush league way of selling more tickets
"Holding" hold up what number "bitch it's 81" "Holding number 81"
Blue Jackets win in OT! 
Did you watch the last two?
Please fix this man's mic during halftime 
They might want to get that mic fixed
Fromme throws like a future HOFer one 3rd down. Next 3rd down like a freshman in college. 
Explain this to me
It sounds like the refs are communicating with aliens. What the fuck is wrong with those mics?
Giant block in the back.
Fix those fucking mics.its not that hard
If the weather's not 10 or below it's not frosty god
FEEDBACK
We needed another 4 q''s of shit offenses.
Hotlanta chilly tonight. 
Yea sure. A true sophomore is in his second title game and #2 all time in TDs for Alabama cuz he can't create.  He can run for TDs to take the lead with 1.5 minutes left in the title game against Clemson, but he can't create. Yea. Ok.
Alabama holding, should be called almost every play. Grabbier than a claw machine. 
Anyone else having problems with watchespn?
Haha that feedback is terrible 
Why is the halftime show outside?
Wtf are players on the cave injured?
Good lord no.Tua with Daboll would probably end up with negative yards.
Bama better have an offense 2nd half or this game is over.
Is that your hat?Yes. Right there it is your hat right?Yes. It is my hat. Well why is that hat there and not on your head? 
My ears just died
We need a turnover.
Kick returns are officially extinct. Someone get Devin Hester and start a museum.
I love them as a neutral viewer.
Oh I'm not saying they'd actually DO better. Just that this game is giving them substance to their claim
Half way through, UCF looks like the national champs 
kendrick gonna b spicy
UCF would be winning this game, honestly
Lol @ ESPN backpedalling after sucking Fromm's dick
I was able to get it without entering any info.
Man, this was the longest pre-show to a Kendrick Lamar concert ever.
I haven't heard that much feedback since I posted my fanfic on tumblr
They've only ran 21 plays
Game of the century of the year?
I can''t believe Fromm is a true freshman. Dude''s gonna be the lock #1 pick in a couple years 
He isn't at the field.
So glad I didn't use it this season 
Damn I was hoping Kendrick was doing like a SB style show not just on a sstage
He was great in the Rose Bowl, so I know he has it in him.
The halftime show isn't even in the stadium?
Does either team have a QB? Jeez.
Might be biased but I recommend it! Lots of good stuff considering a population of 320k . What are you having?
The bands are inside
No, some other place. Weird, right?
thats hot
Bands are on the field I''m pretty sure
Put Tua in already. Sweet fuck. 
can confirm; started to doze off on my couch 
So do people at the game get to watch halftime on a big screen? That seems not fun.
Fromm isn't playing badly. There have been multiple drops. 
Have you seen our map?
Be a lot doper if mine wasn't lagging every 20 seconds
If I've learned anything over the last few years, do it. Plenty of time at half time to catch-up if you miss anything.
Haha I forget people up north don''t automatically associate that with Chick-fil-A 
help a brotha out and upvote so I don't have to keep waiting 10 minutes to meme. this is torture 
We have to make it through an entire summer before we see more college football
Thanks for bringing that up, now I''m sad.
who do you think is a better cuddler in bed, mr. kirby or mr. saban
He already peaked...
Why is the halftime show being played outside the stadium? Is there some sort of reasoning there?
Wtf so the people at the game don't even get to see the halftime show? Lame.
I'll take that over commercial comments
I REMEMBER SYRUP SANDWICHES
I wonder who Mo Smith is cheering for?
They always have bad kickers. Damn Caden Foster.
Sad thing is if GA could conect passes they'd be up by 13. 
But a punter has won the MVP.  Dickson from Texas was named the MVP for a game.
miss the Bills/Jags game did ya?
More boring game than the Bama LSU rematch in 2011?
Everyone 
Halftime not even inside, they paid how much for those tickets?
I'd love if they show the game and not just keep showing Atlanta I know what Atlanta looks like
Why is the "halftime preformance" outside the stadium?
What's a QB?
Ignore me, found one :)
*heh*
Get Hurts out of there.
Thou shalt not worship false idols
Brings the average up to 1.5 penalties per punt return.
He''s a RB that can throw, which is better for Bama than finding a real QB. 
One INT and multiple other bad passes. Fromm nearly threw his second pick on yalls last FG drive.
Does this Georgia team get any worse over the next four years? This seems like a potential dynasty in the making.
I got what you need 
He''s been really impressive all season 
Always
Maybe they are communicating with aliens? 
Right in front of the official, too. What a stupid penalty. 
It's Monday, and I really hate that they're turning this game into the Super Bowl.
Wait. The football patrons can't watch the halftime show???
Who the hell is this tua dude everyone wants 
Exactly what I heard in my head
It is?? What dumbfuck decided that in that low 30 degree weather??
great run stop
http://www.espn.com/watch/player?bucketId=2&id=3265228Lebatard Show Megacast. Greg Cote is on scene
Oh shit, should I run to the liquor store?
LOL talking about putting us in field goal position hahaha
Why is the clock running he went out of bounds???
Time it takes to set up.
How much longer before they put Tua in?
FROSTY
YOOOOOOOOO
That penalty is AXEepted
They aren''t even letting Kendrick Lamar inside?
That's unfortunate. 
Every fan base in the country. Huge overreaction before the half when down one score. 
Not to mention spring. 
Tua isn't good or you mean Daboll would ruin him?
Did you guys hear that Kendrick Lamar is playing at halftime?
But Georgia doesn''t have a 28-3 lead at halftime. 
Halftime show outside seems kind of dumb.
I would feel cheated if I was at that game paying prices that high for a ticket and then finding out the halftime show in not being played in the building. 
Friends, join me in a prayer for all the men with girlfriends who insist on switching over to The Bachelor right now, amen
Hurts doesn't remotely look like the same qb that put up 31 on Clemson last national championship
Fucking terrible play calling from Dabol, just pathetic on all parts for offense tonight
Saban gonna be chewing some ass at halftime 
You, me, and 75% of this thread
AND SYRUP SANDWICHES
I think Pruitt is a good pick up for you guys. Tennessee should be good. No reason a program of your history and resources should be so bad for so long. 
It would have been more fun to watch if UCF was in this game
In those passes Alabama is throwing to the flats, where is the toughness we saw last week?
The bands are playing on the field during halftime
Nobody is going to respect it even if you win.
Only Rodrigo Blackbeard gets me hard
I guess we didn''t actually want to try and score before half...
Georgia D>Bama D
Maybe the schools' marching bands are doing theirs inside?
Blatant holding on Bama like.... constantly.
Better warm up that auto tune
It's been shitty tonight
Oh yeah? Well, well, your school is boring!No, you're right.
Our sidelines were just as hyped all season, always jumping around during kickoffs and celebrating everything
if i have one kid playing at bama and another playing at georgia i'm going to lead every conversation i ever have with that to show off my superior genetics 
Nah the bands are performing inside
Everyone is.
Yeeeeaaaahhhhh!!!cough cough, that hurt my larynx
Oklahoma Georgia should have played twice 
Hurts channeled a spirit animal for this game.Unfortunately, it was Jordan Jefferson.
A lot 
No because Bama is losing here
Probably whatll happen is the actual halftime show is the marching bands but ESPN wants that sweet sweet ad revenue so they put in a "half time show" to bring in eyes
Ohh those are some deep cuts. All I know is that I spent so much time playing 2014 that selling my 360 actually hurt my heart. 
Bucci is talking about the one hockey game that is on tonight. 
Can we get a film room for NFL playoff games? 
Holy crap, sorry I'm late! How many "UCF is the real national champion" jokes have I missed?
Bama, your playcalling and execution leaves a lot to be desired from a neutral perspective.
IM JUST HERE TO SAY WATCH ESPN IS ASS
How many 5 stars on offense for Bama? This is crazy 
Bama if you don''t put Tua in your fucked.
Just for all the other stream only folks info, Hulu streaming on Apple TV 4k has been much much better than on the roku or chromecast. 
Amen 
I enjoy a defensive battle when the offenses meet a base level of competence.
it's been like that since it was created. Every game
Illegal streams are where it's at. Use adblock. This stream is seamless: http://nuelion.pw/hd.php
Sticks to a 20min schedule for halftime. No cleanup involved 
WATCHESPN'S CODE WAS WRITTEN BY UNIVERSITY OF IOWA GRADUATES. TRY ESPN'S DATA CENTER STREAM: http://www.espn.com/watch/player?bucketId=2&id=3265225
Makes me real proud of our offense too though. Now if we could only get one of those things they call "defense"
Hey man, we''re not used to the cold down here. 
Have you not seen Fromm''s throws? He''s made some beauties. 
Get it together #81
You can sell more tickets that way.
I dream of its return every night. 
Again, 28-3And the Braves are trashYuck
hooooh my god that feedback
I miss Coker
Concert outside. lol
Jalen Hurts has not played well.
another great stop, let's go baby
They get the bands, as it should be. 
A quarter of the team is seniors, doesn't seem likely. 
Offense is running like a Swiss... car.
This is embarrassing 
GA is gonna get the ball back with 3 tineouts
Fuck Jalen Hurts
Coaches film room has been the best it's ever been, imo. Last week was the Gary Patterson show.
Too too much
Clear segregation
Hurry up the play clock to give Georgia the ball back sooner.
IS anyone else's watchESPN stream absolutely horrible? Or is it just me? 
LOL THE HALFTIME PERFORMANCE IS NOT EVEN CLOSE TO THE STADIUM WTF?!? XD
Jesus Christ, Hurts...
THREE AND OUT U
he drinks Baileys from a shoe
shh don't let them know
Wait, Kendrick isn't even going to perform in the stadium?I WANT MY MONEY BACK
Fuck it, where is tua
Fire Daboll
Did they just say Frosty (K)night
Hopefully he's not one that gets ruined by the Browns
And crime allowances 
Jalen Hurts is ass 
The Lebatard stream is finally a megacast show worth watching 
Always.
#tuatime
literally everyone
Probably because marching band still performs so couldn't set up a stage
Because Landon Collins played for Alabama, he is looking at the coaches and reading the call, then saying what the call will be. Georgia could potentially use this to their advantage if they can line the call up with the call. Typically speaking, the media is supposed to avoid exposing calls.
Your kickers aren't the problem, it's all the dipshits holding and getting block in the back
Hard to believe Oklahoma scores so many points on this same Georgia defense 
Does the winner of this game play UCF for the trophy?
THEM DAWGS IS HELL
Ah, yes. SEC football. What's an offense again?
WHY ARE YOU OUTSIDE THE STADIUM MAN
Hurts is so bad 
Alabama may never score again.
k DOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Fromms had a decent night. 
Hurts is awful.
Hurts throwing it away on 3rd down is his signature move
Loving all of this
Harass his ass
No. UGA offense > Bama offense
JALEN IS TRASHPUT TUA IN ALREADY
[deleted]
this is jalen hurt's problem, the man is way too skittish in the pocket
Dawgs D is the truth
The penalty on punt is spotted from the spot of the catch (since the ref didn't mention that).
The half time show is not inside the stadium? That's weird.
If we punt here I swear to god
We get much better next couple years
None
Hurts had a LOT of space in the other direction
Alabama has no answer for that UGA D
How many 3 and outs is that for Georgia D?
So, is Saban playing conservative to try and get to halftime, or are they just getting destroyed? 
DAWGS flushed bama out, just like a bad turd
Our defense is swarming hurts bitchasssss
Can this opening act end already? Ready for this concert we all came to see Edit: /s since some of you are that fucking dry
Jalen is going to lose this game. 
Need more from a QB than just not throwing INTs.
Oh my GOD, Jalen Hurts is just as incompetent as Brandon Wimbush.
Close... 
PULL JALEN HURTS OUT OH MY GODDDDDDDDDD FUCKKKKK
He's not even in the stadium! I've watched all of those commercials for nothing! 
The people inside leave and can't get back in.  They need to pay to get back in.  More money for people to make.
WHY IS ILLEGAL STREAMING RUNNING SMOOTHER THAN THE OFFICIAL ESPN STREAM. WTF
Good drive there...
[deleted]
[deleted]
He has 68 yards if you''re 92 yards, not bad
Bench Jalen for Tua. Bama doesn''t have a QB
DUDE I CANNOT STAND JALEN HE HAD OPEN DUDES CAN WE PUT IN TUA
Hurts is so bad...
SEzzzzzzzzz
On the one hand, don't want to upvote you because Michigan. On the other...Go Jackets!
Atlanta is a very underrated city 
It doesn't even matter haha
Wtf was hurts doing? He had a wide fucking lame.
In their defense claw machines don''t grab that much...Source: Wasted we''ll over $100 on claw machines in 2017
More $$$
I hope
Tua
B1G if true?
This is what happens when you have a running back at QB.
BENCH HIM
ESPN WATCH MACHINE BROKE
So OUs offense is like, *really* fucking good 
I love how after every play you can see the players watching themselves on the big screen.
another barn burner all-SEC championship
Kung Fu Kenny 
It's Tua time.
that's what I'm talking about Dawgs, let's fucking go!!!!!!!!!!
Do you think we might see some Tua in the second half? 
Hurts is so bad
If Bama loses tonight, is it a QB controversy?  
:(
It might be on the big screen
wha wha wha whaat ar ar ar are yo you talk talk talking a a a about?
Jalen Hurts sets the forward pass back a hundred years.
Bama going to end the half with 10:23 time of possession. 
Hurts is playing like Paul Crewe when he started throwing the game 
# JalenHurtsexposedparty
It hurts to watch jalen. Pun totally intended
Jalen please bench yourself. 
More like Fromm >>>>> Hurts
About tree fiddy 
Tua
Jalen is playing like shit and the Alabama front is getting their asses kicked. 
/r/CFB to UGA: "*You can't possibly believe your own hype that much!*"UGA to /r/CFB: **"I am the hype!"**
Sweet mother McCree these comments are going by fast. Please help.
I'm glad we got two SEC teams in the playoff. Not sure what I would've done had there been touchdowns
Jalen Hurts is fucking awful in big games
[deleted]
... That it hurts?
SUBSCRIBE
the clock restarts when they bring the ball back in until the last 2 mins of each half
Nah, I think the fact that our offense is so stagnant and our d is staying on the field is the issue
Yea you guys get 3 inches of snow and schools canceled for a week and it's 35 below here and school goes on normally 
I was told there would be a Tua time
Things I did *NOT* expect in the 1st half: 6 points
Fuck it. Shut Alabama out 
That was an amazing game. But then again, it wasn't stopped every other play for a commercial
He''s not a good qb. 
Josh Dobbs would've found a way out of that 
Put Tua in
What good is going to a Kendrick concert if you can't smoke in the crowd?
Give us Tua
Was he out before he threw? Doesn't really matter since 4th down but every yard helps
I want to see Tua 
alabama needs a defensive score to win this game.
Tua time? 
WHERE HOW SEND ME A FUCKING LINK IM DYING HERE
Why is the half time concert not inside the fucking stadium? 
“Worth the wait”.      *kendrick comes on* *announcers turn on Led Zeppelin in the booth*
Jalen Hurts is ass my dudes 
jaloa tualurts
Going fast did not work
Were loosing a ton of seniors.  Including Chubb and Michel
Not awareness whatsoever got fucking damn dude you could''ve ran that easily for a 1st down
Saban doesn''t sleep in a bed. He sleeps sitting at his desk for 10 minutes a week. 
I''m hard again 
Yeah, I'm not watching this second half. This game is boring as shit. 
Why is clock still running? Didn't he run out of bounds? edit: On the first down play
How you gonna have halftime outside?
By game's end Nick Saban will be brought to his knees, begging for mercy from King Kirby as he drives a stake through his head, assuming his soft spoken alpha bravado and his seven titles.
Yeah coaches have been praising him.
Right?? Lame af
He could throw better under Kiffin.
Hurts doing what he does best.. not throw the ball well.
if he had cut that up he had the first easyyyy
Where the fuck is Tua?Edit: if bama doesn''t put him in, it''s over.
[deleted]
Hurts isn't even seeing guys who are pretty wide open all day. Showing pretty poor composure.
Why does Hurts do that weird shit where he just stands there for an extended period of time?
He had a huge hole to run inside
lmao the audience who paid all that money for the tickets dont even get to see the halftime perfomance... ITS OUTSIDE! 
Is Tua seriously not better than this? 
Has Jalen declared for draft yet?
Wide open. Wide. Freaking. Open.
Damn you could see a Bama player just give up running his route as soon as Hurt starts scrambling.
Daboll is going to be disemboweled at halftime.
Way to go defense, flush and contain, lay the pressure on Hurts! I love it, quick 3 and out
Yeah it's always terrible, but it's especially bad tonight. And I've been having issues with this tcl tv overall so I was wondering if it was just me
Loving our defense right now. 
Georgia gonna get another 3 now 
Jalen Hurts to watch. 
WTF HURTS the entire left side of the field was open just run!
I feel like I'm watching the 1936 Cotton Bowl
If you think you should go fucking go. Don't just fuck around and throw it away. Starting job up for grabs.
From the way this game has been they're looking less and less like jokes.
That was a good one. I''ll always remember the viva la bam one as one of my favorite skating games ever though. 
Fuck you''re right, sorry. I''m not mentally en pointe tonight 
When a team knows what they're doing against Alabama and they look bad. They look REALLY, REALLY bad.
At what point does Saban pull the Tua trigger?
fuck this football shit I''m tryna see the Black Panther sneek peak
wow the fucking alabama guy just pushed the georgia dude down, where's the flag? why can't they be unbiased 
You don''t know that. 
I feel bad for Alabama''s offence. 
Because more people are trying to use the Espn stream 
*concussed 
Sure
Jalen Hurts is doing a great job of padding his Roll Out To The Right and Throw It Out Of Bounds stats this evening.
It's cool guys, we're just tiring out their offense
Anyone saying this game is boring needs to flip to the Coaches Room broadcast. Fascinating.
~*Georgia goes up 6-0*~That's game y'all
Jalen has no pocket presence, that''s tuff 
Though not likely, Daboll is quickly coaching himself out of a job.  I wouldn't be surprised if after 2018 he takes a head coaching job by force.
Hurts ran directly into the pressure instead of towards the 40 yards of open field.
Milton > Hurts 
They say defense wins championships, but more say UCF doesn't...
Georgia's D is impressive.
Looking forward to the Kendrick Lamar concert and Black Panther special.
h o l y shit i am bored
Tua Time 
i long for UCF
Would be nice for Georgia to get another 3 before half
The answer to that is always yes.
Neither is Oregon State
Who put the Bills Jaguars game back on?
Man Hurts is a GREAT athlete but this is the second year in a row in their most important game, he can't figure out the whole quarterback part of the position.
with his eyes open
Tim Tebow 
I guess the good thing about 2 SEC teams in the championship is we don''t have to constantly hear about how “X” is built like an SEC team. 
Wims is back
I play with friends sometimes in comp but their situational awareness is terrible. They''re fun to play with and I encourage them but it hasn''t been good for my rating at all lol.I was hoping to hit plat this season but it''s an uphill battle on Everest.
Wims lives! DILLY DILLY!
score before the half
UCF would have put points on the board in the first half, that's for sure.
Hurts is garbage
Wow Hurts sucks
There was a lot of room on the left hand side on that 3rd down
Nice
Have they ever thought about adding crumple zones to helmets?
John O' Korn looks at Jalen Hurts and thinks "Brother!"
I swear he's getting worse
Tua hasn't played in months and hasn't played a single team that hasn't already died before he came out 
Damn straight. 
We don''t need him as a running back. The passing threat will open up the run game.
Hurts should just convert to RB at this point
I'm in love with Georgia's defense.
Hurts is so fucking bad it hurts
We got 'em figured out. 
Don't forget the commercials.
Jesus all he does is choke
ok UCF, take the Bama costumes off and return to form please
Go Dawg brethren. 
Marching bands i believe
I don't understand, did people pay just for the show?
Not. Yet.
There are times to be woke. This is not one of them. 
I hate Bama just as much as Georgia
It's on ESPN3 if you're able to get on there.
Wims is back!
The main ESPN stream sucks. But try the hometown radio feed. Same broadcast, less people streaming it, plus hometown radio broadcasters instead of ESPN announcers!Other option I like is the sky cam or the sounds of the game stream. Sounds of the game is great cuz it''s the same video feed of the main stream, but all you hear is the crowd, the bands, and the PA announcer!
He's not a good quarterback. 
If jalen hurts played on any other team he would look like brandon harris
Can we have another QB please. Watching Hurts play hurts.
Why would Alabama try to hurry up there??
[deleted]
Defense shutting Bama out in the first half. Wow, did not expect that!
UCF gets their title, this is the consolation game
I taste salt.
Get on with Kendrick Lamar
>  talk shit about Alabama > get upvotes 
NCAA 2005 Update: My Gators get the ball back after a quick 3 and out at our own 39 yard line with 4:48 to go in the half. 0-0 score still
#HURTS IS A RB PLAYING QB 
It's only 6-0 but it feels like 28-0
So are we gonna see a fight or what?
Remember when Jalen Hurts was a heisman candidate? Pepperidge Farms remembers...
Jalen is having the worst game of his life.
Hurts is the worst QB to watch, maybe in all of CFB.
The halftime show is *outside* the stadium? That is so dumb. If I bought a ticket to the championship game and they did that to me, I'd be livid. 
I'm excited
When''s the last time you saw a phone booth, not a pay phone bank
Perhaps its cause I'm a hockey fan and a Big 12 student, but I just hate how slow this game is...
All Alabama needs is a TD and they are leading this game 
I am genuinely impressed with the lack of commercials during the latter half of this quarter. But I'm sure they'll make up for it later.
aren't you watching on TV?
Bama: ".....KILL HIM!"
Bring out Tua
Tua Just put in TuaWe ain''t gonna win like this anyhow. Might as well try SOMETHING!!!
they should swap him out for one of their other 6 five star quarterbacks
Their defense has been on the field twice as long as Georgia''s. They''re gonna break down soon.
Hurts is really good at running the ball.... Not throwing...
I've dislocated my shoulder before. The fuck kind of drugs are they giving players in the locker room where they can come right back in
If you force hurts to throw he cannot win the game 
Jalen Hurts is trash 
WAIT, REALLY?
Shh that was just a warm up drive
Jalen blows where is tua?
1
For those unaware: Kendrick isn't performing inside the stadium because that's where the bands are performing.
Jalen hurt sex posed party.
THE BEST IN ALL OF COLLEGE FOOTBALL
Hurts has absolutely no composure
Because they already got the people insides money.
Makes me so sad there aren''t new ones. Although sports games have turned to the pay2win market so hard maybe its for the best. 
Pop that shoulder back in get a shot and it's go time.
Can we have Bill Walton call these games instead of Herbstreit? 
STOP THROWING THE BALL AWAY
I feel like I already saw this game before in New Orleans on January 1. 
Man I bet all those cold fans would love a #Runzahandwarmer tm
I'm willing to bet that Tua will be QB1 in the second half. 
He's another Tyrod Taylor clone.
So I guess they allow cortisone injections in college.  
Wims is coming back!
Is it veiny
Lol, yes!!!
Hurts is so fucking terrible.
I was told Jalen Hurts' experience would be the difference this game. I was not told his experience caused PTSD. 
No Kirk, that''s Mr Clutch. 
No, UCF is already champion. The winner of this game is the also champion.
The best WatchESPN has ever been for me is a solid "bad"
I don't know what you do for work but are ya hiring 
You're right, I think running Bo a lot is kind of the issue
Even I'm frustrated watching Hurts 
"Dowgs."\-Chris Fowler
HOW HAS ALABAMA WON WITH JALEN HURTS?
Can't tell of Hurts is garbage or it's just the play calling
Don''t worry guys. While Georgia and Bama haven''t provided sparks yet, I''m sure Kendrick will during halftime 
They''re playing Big 10 football. Best football.
Should they start Tua 2nd half.....?
Time for Tua? 
Us back judges love it when they do that, though... Easy call for us.
The alternate feeds are making this game interesting
Hurts has this really shitty tendency to drift outwards towards the sideline whenever there''s pressure... 
Did 58 on Georgia have a BRAND on his arm? Wtf.
Hell yeah on Wims!
I'm loving the 2018 Kendrick Lamar concert so far 
Hurts looks like he''s never started a game before (just like every week) and Fromm looks composed and talented 
I would rather see a bag of sour patch kids play QB than Hurts rn
Think its time for Tua
NOBODY WAS OPEN
When you want to go fast but they still almost sack you.
Jalen baby what iz you doin?
pyrotechnics and aircrafts... calling it now
troll
Jalen Hurts my eyes to watch him play qb
aight enough bullshit..put tua in.he can hand the ball of too..plus he can actually throw the ball
Bama''s offense is ass, my dudes
Can''t believe there wasn''t a flag
Alabama's playing like they did at Jordan Hare
I think the halftime show will be the best part of this game by far
*screams into the void* A touchdown! A field goal! My kingdom for a quarterback!
It's more our shit QB.
Everyone is yelling about daboll, but imagine being in his position.  You're calling plays for a QB that can't hit an open WR and has ZERO pocket presence... you're going to be pretty limited in the plays you can call.
Where''s that on at?
I wouldn''t mind being sandwiched in between those two snugglywumps, personally 
JK Scott? What is that haircut?
Why? It doesn't look like it'll be any more intricate than a superbowl halftime
This is college football dude. Only a loser brings up other teams.
Sometimes college football is exciting and the passion and energy of these young players is infectious. Sometimes the incredible lack of precision and overall ability compared to the NFL makes for a bad product. Tonight seems more like the latter
Nick''s gonna give them hell in the locker room
Every neutral fan pretending they wouldn''t get blown out by either team so they can talk mad shit right now...(Except for you Auburn. You have all the bragging rights) Edit: Didn''t think I needed to mention UCF since I said neutral fans. UCF isn''t neutral, they''re superior. 
Sounds like an intangible to me. 
Possibly due to increased security from potus. Total wild guess here
Yo what kind of sandwich should I make1. Ham2. Turkey3. PB & JEdit: two people have said turkey so that's my decision. 
Bama Oline looks like a dumpster fire
Remember when when Jeudy said the Bama Corners can''t stop  them lol 
Yeah we are losing this with Hurts playing like this.  Good job Dawgs.
Dan has got it right. This game blows and UCF should be in it. 
I wouldn''t go that far.....
turn the TV off.
I think he''d be hard pressed to find a state that doesn''t have a history of discriminatory practices buddy
Done!
You're good people. I like you. I really hope you're right, I'm ready for us to be competitive and actually do something with it.
B A S K E T B A L L
That's ok. We don't an offense. 
Labatt Blue Light! A fine Canadian Pilsener
The LSU-Bama championship game that got criticized for being boring had more points than this before halftime lmao
What was that parabolic microphone thing on the sidelines?
T U A UA
Would love to see Roquan, Wynn, or Michel with a star on their helmet this Fall.
On the plus side, if you're in the stadium you can get some cheap food and beer during halftime and not miss anything I guess.
Really? So people at the game can't even watch it?
hurts should transfer to GT. he would be a good fit for our offense
great catch Ridley, hot fucking dam
Halftime adjustments wins the game... So far it's THRILLING
Points here definitively win this half 
Lucky. I had to sign up for a free trial on Sling because all of the streams were getting shut down. 
This game is ass
God he sucks so bad
Wait, so if Georgia scores 25 to end this, does that remove the curse?  Asking for a friend.
/r/theydidthemath
Dammit Saban quit standing around with your dick in your hands and put Tua in, Jalen is actively losing us this fucking game
zzzzz commercial zzzz
... like the north is discrimination free
Lol they're gonna let alabama win somehow. Watch. 
Normally i like defensive games however this game sure has been...... boring am i alone on this?
Dabol
Run left lol shit awareness 
Yep
He''d be a good running back but damn he just doesn''t work at QB 
Homers is fire 
I tell you, that Georgia team down there is really built like an SEC team.
Fade me fam
4th quarter when he's up by 4 scores
Hurts as bad as this Watch ESPN feed
Ridley is clutch as fuck
Will Fromm be better than Stafford?
yeah if he had taken off to the left that would have been a 30+ yard run
Hurts fucking blows.
The halftime performance is outside the stadium? Fucking LMAO!
This little Ridley brother is good. 
Take your up vote 
What about UCF?
Oh I wish we didn''t make so many mistakes against bama :''(
That clap hike.. can't that be easily faked by the opposing tean
There's a bunch of episodes on YouTube. 
I''m seeing people say “Bama''s fucked if they don''t put in Tua” but just wait until Saban pulls some bullshit and wins like 14-13 or something.
Here's an idea, cover Ridley like they cover Ridley
YES
really blows my mind with how good saban  is at recruiting Bama couldn't find a better QB than hurts.
I have a quart sized stein that is amazing for CFB games. Just drank a stein of Mississippi Mud Black and Tan. Edit: Downvoted! Someone not like beer?! I'll buy you a soda or sparkling water, fren.
Both
I want the halfitime score to be 9-0don't get a touchdown georgia
Great job Jalen. Fuck
Woooow that''s sad
Only a matter of time until one of these teams commute a gigantic unsportsmanlike penalty that sets up the other team for a score. 
Reminds me of Matt Jones. Great athlete terrible QB.
Alright, sorry, your states will, nobody North of Missouri and West of Texas will care.
Terrible throwing from Fromm tonight
The only ones getting their ass kicked is the viewer. This game sucks ass.
Our WR threw a 40 yard pass and Jalen got one of his garunteed 30 yard runs. He's a dynamic athlete but that doesn't make him a good qb. 
Would you mind telling me the score?
If someone were to hold Wims upside down his jersey would say "SWIM."
The Real Ridley 
Little Bro. looking good.
I'm with you Longhornbro 
Everyone knows you can't defend a QB if you can't spell his name!
Left too much time for The Fromm
Man if this how bad Bama and Clemson really are, OSU would've beat their asses in bowl season this year.
And Georgia is really good at tackling him before he gets to the line
:/
this Alabama offense is terribleeee
What role would Hurts have in the NFL? Special teams?
So are the bands still performing at halftime inside the stadium?
Nah we''d kick Bama''s ass /s
Bruh Georgia's PR should have channeled his inner James Harden right there and flop hard to see if he could draw a flag
Not fucking soon enough
Calvin Ridley: "I'm the best WR in college football" Riley Ridley: "You not even the best WR in your family bro"
Fuck Calvin. Hope the Bears draft Riley
[They are stickied. Gotta look my dude.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CFBStreams/comments/7p2z2k/game_thread_4_alabama_vs_3_georgia_800_pm_et/dse7i5h/)
Who was open that play? I'll give you 3 weeks to tell me. 
Interesting, mines been great on Cast so far
Riley > Calvin
Half time score 8 5
Hurts is 3/8 for 21 yards lol
I'm depressed and I don't know if it's cause our offense looks horrible or cause I did Coke last night 
Hurts fucking sucks
Why would you go fast there? That's incredibly stupid. You still have three timeouts, if you get the first you have plenty of time anyways, and if you don't get the first you can burn another 40 off the clock.
Shitty championship game
Did they accidentally leave the Georgia gloves in butter overnight?
Ridley is going to double his receptions for the season in this one game
Not ALL the bragging rights. They haven't done great in this building
Ridley having a big game when it matters
Maybe our D will put some points up in the next half...
They're gonna play commercials between songs during Kendrick's set. 
Well, most of the bragging rights.
I am rooting for Georgia solely based on the fact that Alabama's meathead strength coached smashed their runner-up trophy from last year. Nothing funnier than to see them get a new one. 
Except for that ucf debacle
I like wims because I like his hair!
I would really hate to be an Alabama player at halftime.
Can we get the Sooners to Atlanta and switch them with Alabama buy the time Kendrick is done? Give me more of that 
That missed FG is unforgivable
STOP DROPPING THE FUCKING BALL
Georgia should really invest in one of [these] (https://imgur.com/a/fzl8u) for Kirby
Georgia o line is legit
bRoTHeRs
Joey Freshwater is not impressed with the first half.
why is fromm underthrowing so much
Fans still panicking though lol 
Well we had a TD that was overthrown because Jalen sucks balls
Oh my Godwin, catch the ball!
Calvin wishes he had a real qb to throw him balls.
If Bama doesn't win this then I'm firmly on board with UCF being the national title winner 
It's a flag if you're caught doing it
Have we gone deep once?I mean we only have a top 5 receiving core..... Why would we want to use them for anything but swing passes?
Sooners would have beat the shit out of bama.
$$$
0-6 Dawgs.
Halftime thread when?
Oh My Godwin
So many dropped passes.
"Have you heard of glockenspiels?"
Bama d is gassed.
Let tua get some snaps dammit
Come on guys that's like 4 drops  this half 
Nah
Idk about you guys but I could use a break from all this football to hear about some sweet products and services.
Is Jalen Hurts playing next year? Cause if I'm Tua and I don't get time this game, I'd transfer.
6 pnts seems insurmountable right now.
Fuck it. Put Tua in. If he fucks up, it can't get much worse than having Hurts not doing anything. 
Kevin Sumlin adds absolutely nothing to this Film Room
''comes back and makes a nice hand catch''Jesus these commentators are talented
This is more the QBs being ass than good D
UCF earned that right too.
I''d rather watch Scott''s tots than Jalen hurts play quarterback
Georgia receiving corps must've just hit puberty
If Tua doesn't start the second half we should probably look in to some match fixing by Bama.
Have you accepted UCF into your life yet?
Oh boy this thread is getting pretty big! To save your browsers, we have a halftime thread coming up just for you! This stickied comment will be updated with the link to the halftime thread.Edit: [Here is the halftime thread!](https://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/7p438g/game_thread_cfp_ncg_georgia_vs_alabama_8pm_et/)
Has Hurts always been this bad?
Turkey. With da cheese!!
Compared to the Rose Bowl every game this season is boring
As bad as our year was, we weren''t blown out by bama. 
Jalen is going to lose this game for us
Fromm is he a true or redshirt frosh?
Any Alabama fan who defends Jalen after this is just wrong
I HATED that the year we won. They kept saying we were built like an SEC team and at one point they actually said we were the SEC team of the north.
I just made a bbq
Yeah this fucking sucks...
Many drops tho.
[deleted]
How could bama not have any better qbs.....
Yeah, it''s time to put Tua in and see how he does. Hurts is just not there for us right now and we need something on offense.
Riley is playing balls out tonight 
Georgia team looks dominant in the first half of a Championship game.  No history of losing a lead.  Game over
Probably charging for tickets lol. We had regional band competition in MB stadium and acoustics sucked ass
Oh yeah! Easiest call I've seen tonight! 
Try Coke Zero.
Dude, on a personal level, it's been a QB problem since the middle of the season. Ive been calling for Tua for a while now. You could create some really creative play designs with a Dual-Lefty. I think Jalen is an average QB and can't throw a ball under the slightest bit of pressure. 
We get it, they''re brothers. 
Who is this Maria Taylor guy?
What''s up with the brands, anyway?  I''ve always wondered about them. 
Second. Half. Adjustments.
They already played
"hand catch" lmao that's just called a catch homie 
Repeat after me everyone: Defense is not boring
Well where else would the halftime entertainment perform?
Hey man, what did I do to you?
I feel like Jalen is self-conscious about his stats. He doesn't want to throw picks, so he throws it away. I just wish he let the ball go and said fuck it sometimes.
PB&J all the way
well yeah, where's the fun in that lmao
Brother vs brother...This some Civil War shit. 
It''s a penalty for the defense to fake the clap to cause it to be hiked early I think. 
Ewwww....Ha, good luck.
Calvin Ridley isn''t a senior!???!
6th string punt returner 
Aren't you forgetting the National Champions?
So, the Kendrick Lamar halftime show is really just a CFP sponsored concert somewhere outside the stadium?
We'd have scored more than 0.
i want to see jalen throw tua 50 yeards.
The only thing keeping us in this is the drops, man. Offense looks like shit and the defense can't get off the field.
I mean there's a ton of bad throws in this game. I feel like every Ohio State fan that shit on JT should notice that college QBs are rarely excellent. 
Lol you're Drunk 
Where''d the commercials go? I don''t know what to do with myself? Also, Bama not scoring in the first half? Didn''t see that coming. 
That was a butt clencher
Ya'll need to put Tua in if you want to win this game.
Oh we'd lose. I doubt their ability to put up 100 on us though, and I'll take that as a win
Ive actually seen a couple start ups that are focusing on creating new helmets like that. Cant name one off the top of my head but theyre def out there
For the defense it's a delay of game penalty I think. 
I think that would likely result in a flag.
Bruh, y'all are in the national championship game. CATCH THE FUCKING BALL
Ridley is doing better than Ridley
Remember when hurts was in early heisman talks lol
Running back? No idea, cant pass for shit
Take a shot every time they mention they're brothers
With 2 minutes left in the half Alabama is tied with UCF: 0-0
Alabama's defense is tired as fuck
Offense chokin
that was close, holy shit
Kinda
WHO TAUGHT THESE GUYS HOW TO CATCH
Of course the one fucking unheralded 3* we start on offense is the most important position, what''s the point of recruiting as well as we do if we don''t capitalize on it?
Dropped passes are killing us.
WE WANT A UCF THREAD
WR?
None.
that was a terrible decision.
lol this is so bad
yep
Other players get tattoos, that guy gets branded.
How many helmets would you need a game?
MODS WE NEED A HALF TIME SHOW THREAD
This game might actually put me to sleep
Thanks Harvard
I dunno what I ate, but it smells as bad as this Bama offense has been playing
Does Saban do horrible things to the offense during halftime?
Fromm is throwing duck after duck.
Is that Ridley guy related to that other Ridley guy?
Rude
Hurts absolutely can not throw the ball.
Good thing that dB is 5''7” lol
jesus, dude
Dem funky balls
Holy hell Fromm what the fuck
FROMM SUCKS. SHOULD HAVE THREE INTS BY NOW
How many Saban coordinators have become head coaches since he went to Bama?
Fromm almost fucked up big time 
It's easy to be better when you actually have a qb
Wow these offenses are terrible 
hot dam that was to close, lol
I agree. This game sucks. Far cry from the Rose bowl
Make the teams do something
> Talk shit about Jalen > get double the upvotes
That was almost an amazing play by a few people.
I think Riley has the better QB....
Saban should put O'korn in for the second half
I swear this has been the year of dropped passes. I don't remember seeing this many dropped in big games as I have this year.
That was... risky.
Fuck 
Serious question, when was the last time Alabama came back down, well, anything more than 3 at halftime.I'm calling this for Georgia, Alabama doesn't know how to come from behind.  It's like they don't understand they can.
Shoulda closed out Georgia then
Lol :)
Riley Ridley is fucking balling out tonight. Good for him man.
Alabama shouldn't even be here in the first place
So...a pick 6
Sssshh. We're pretending he's better than Hurts. 
lol imagine Coker with this team
Seriously what in the fuck is causing them to keep hurts in 
Couldn't even beat the shit out of Georgia
[removed]
Fromm is trying to pass Alabama back into the game.
NO U
How tf
This game blows
fuck me that was dangerous, FUCK!
"But we like it here" - some guy 20 minutes ago. 
It really is. I just don't understand it, so bizarre and unnecessary. 
Fromm: Throws ball near sideline*Ref: Call inbounds*Espn: Stares down ref* Ref: OFFICIAL REVIEW*Experieon: Did you know we can scan the “dark web”?
ok
I think he qualifies for some sort of clipboard holding position. 
Salami and provolone
Someone call a time out I want to see more commercials I can't watch this any more.
Our playcalling tells me they have no faith in Hurts
So is Riley Ridley a sophomore or freshman bc they''ve said both
I'm just here for the most fire halftime show since Janet and Justin.
Jags-Bills had more offense than this
State Farm playing with Mayhem
Nah, something's up. He looked hurt on that big sack.
BOTH guys shoulda brought that down
Wow, that play -- almost intercepted, almost caught. 
Lmao
WELL THIS COMMERCIAL HAS BEEN PRETTY DAMN BORING TOO
Making the important observations - and you don't even go to Harvard!
I know we won''t put in Tua for the national championship but goddamn do I want it 
Jags-Bills Pt. 2
"the ball came out funky" 
You gotta catch that if ur Godwin
The crazy part is that he beat out, what, four other guys for the job last year? 
Yea i'm used to hockey as well, no commercials...granted less advertisers but still
Nick Saban is going to castrate these guys for blocking in the back lol
Seconded
LOL 
And on a few of the ESPN feeds
Defense usually hands them possessions on a silver platter
This has been the hardest football game to watch without cable I've ever tried to watch.Spectrum and ATT have insanely non-user-friendly/functional websites...using the streams on here actually worked 100x better.
This feels like 21-0 except Bama is on the losing end
Film Room is a college football fans wet dream. Great stuff.
6-0? Gotta love winter baseball. 
We're trying! Our memes on the Twitter account aren't working! D:
Sweet, I'll remember that one if I ever go to Canada!
Fromm plz
[deleted]
If Alabama doesn't make some serious adjustments at halftime I don't think they're winning this game. Their offense can hardly move the ball and their defense is failing at making Georgia one dimensional like most teams they've played this year.
quit trying to control us
Hurts needs to sit in the pocket longer...he leaves before it collapses
Bench Fromm!
These are the facts ESPN doesn't want us to know
I feel like we coulda stacked the box against this kid... not that it would have mattered. Just more broken tackles. 
3rd and long?Michel can do it.
I'd join it
Mr. Choke back at it again.
Nothing is as bad as an ESPN feed
lol kirk saying dude had a pick six when he falls on his back
Is it TUA TIME? 
Not a big cheese fan. I think I'll go PB & J
Who would win:- Five hundred Georgia drops- One boring Hurts boi
GO SONY GO!
Nerves. They said it well earlier, the kid was getting his shit for prom last year at this time, now he's playing in the second biggest football game of the year
We''re watching an all-SEC natty, my dude.
I figured this game would be more interesting going into the half. Hmm. 
sony michel is a grown ass man
FEED MICHEL
Great we can discuss more commercials
PLAYSTATION
Jake Fromm is ass my dudes
Seriously?? He has played so fucking well all fucking year and y''all just disown him? Stand by your man
So many drops 
Georgia receivers sure can drop 'em.
SOOONNNNYYYY
I'M JUST HERE FOR KENDRICK
Too bad Spurrier wasn''t a commentator for this. 
Sony! You beautiful beautiful boy!
Damn, Alabama just can't get off the field on third downs.
Crap, please get a first down. Don''t want to give Bama one more chance.
do you guys compile your CSS? :)
It's pretty fucking bad.
Omg Sony took a headshot. 
Incoming James Winstone sub
So would the Coaches Room broadcast include their commentary on the Kendrick Lamar concert?
this is embarrassing
Michel is fucking GOAT 
If Georgia wins this, will Fromm be the new Darnold?
Which commercial is half-time?
And Calvin is OBVIOUSLY a confederate player tonight
Because they focus on their run game.Guess why most bama QBs don't get drafted
About a 5% chance we win this game
Sony! 
SONY COME TO THE NEW YORK GIANTS PLS
How many can the ga recievers drop?
I'm rooting for you, Georgia, but you sure do like dropping balls. 
I''ve seen about 20 Bills-Jaguars jokes in the last 15 minuts.
If only our Ridley could get some looks
2
Thanks! And it's depressing that the broadcast is as disappointing as we all imagined it'd be
SONYYYYYYYYY! I WAS ALWAYS A PLAYSTATION KID ANYWAY
This game is going by fast
[Yeah haha.](http://i0.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/facebook/000/016/546/hidethepainharold.jpg)
I dont want to go to the hospital tonight tho 
More like Fromm > Hurts. 
God I hope the Jets draft Michel in the future 
Lol fuck this “defense” what a fucking joke. 
3rd and Bama once again!
How many dropped passes are there gonna be 
If Fromm had some accuracy it would be scary how good Georgia is.
Wow he got popped in the head 
I was laughing to myself it was too perfect. 
Yah
How did Lane Kiffin make Hurts a heisman candidate?
3 & long, fuck it. Let's run
I'd rather see them. Is there a channel that would show that? My coworkers son is in the UGA band 
It''s not like UGA is burning up the field. 
Why not call a TO there?
Bama is in trouble. Michel is wrecking and Chubb is just waiting. 
Kicc boi fade.
>losers>falcons>bravesLol
Why don't the mods let us crash reddit anymore?
Halftime thread is gonna be just Kendrick Lamar memes
Hurts is highly overrated and I don''t see him amounting to much if he gets drafted at all.
In comparison to a face catch
Well, if you're the organizer, you can set Kendrick in front of a bunch of Bama and UGA fans, or in front of a bunch of Atlanta natives. Hmm......
Another SEC game, another FG exhibition.Zzzzzzz.....
All my Zoes, stand up!
Motion to remove third downs from the game. 
Jalen Hurts is sometimes good but mostly ass my dudes
Who's been worse? Dude is awful. Can't make throws and can't make reads. He's a great runner, but it just sucks because Alabama has a MUCH better QB behind him 
sometimes i think sony is better than chubb
Error 404: 3rd down defense not found.
Damn what a run.  Bama what are you doing on 3rd down?
You trying to kill people?
Christ almoughty, Bama/ND was a better NCG
Tell that to Clemson bro
H8 FEEDS THE DAWGS, MODS NICE HATE 
[I can't hear you over the sound of you not having any flair.](https://flair.redditcfb.com/)
Justin Fields feeling pretty good tonight. Fromm looks awful
Bama defense so gassed. 
.....Jake Fromm may actually also be bad.
USERS WE WILL HAVE A HALFTIME SHOW THREAD AT HALFTIME.
Who''s your backup and is he better then Hurts?
*don't cry yet don't cry yet don't cry yet*
Thanks Sony <3 <3
Nice
Nick Saban is about to blow his lid over this.
Omg Riley is the younger brother? No. 
Nothing I love more than when Sony gets loose
let's fucking go baby, get those fucking points!!!!
Drop all the passes!
Second half will tell a different, yet familiar story 
3rd and 10? Sony, would you please
True
Targeting
Breaking: Calvin now second string at the Ridley family picnic football game.
These teams suck
When did they change what they wear though?
My balls come out funky sometimes too
This is fucking pathetic 
Forreal, I'd rather watch UCF not even kidding.
why doesn't he go by Cavin Ridley to make it more confusing?
Lol, Bama 
Yep. Same story as last year.
Fromm looks a little nervous
i say 0
True
Fuck the SEC this game is putting me to sleep.Fromm is gonna be a god-tier in a couple years though
yes
Bama's defense has been mind bogglingly bad on third down
Hey at least there was the Rose Bowl
I''m not your dude, bro
This game is total BUTT SUCK
S Y R U P S A N D W H I C H E S
Just came to ask what the fuck were those horseshoes on that guy's arm? 
Boooo
Michel is a MONSTER
Not going to lie. These don't remotely look like the 2 best teams in the country
Holy fuck this is annoying
Not understanding these passes to the far side of the field at all
Didn't know soccer games had a halftime...
Can we please have less football commentary, and more discussions about the Grateful Dead in 2018? 
Wow Georgia looks so much better than Alabama. Alabama''s defense is insane but when they''re staying out on the field the whole time, they''re getting worn out.
How are you not prepared for a run in that situation, honestly.
I love Chubb but he is. 
Who the hell is tua
bama in meltdown right now
Fromm, my dude. Slow it down breh. 
Heads up play by Ben and Jake!
Hurts has a great athleticism and and a nice arm. No awareness or balls. We''ve had WR''s a step ahead all night and hes too scared or too incompetent to even attempt a fucking throw down the field. Im so heated right now. 
[deleted]
brothers brothers brothers brothers brothers brothers brothers brothers brothers brothers brothers brothers brothers brothers brothers brothers brothers brothers brothers brothers brothers
Fix your fucking mics it's really not that difficult
Saban gonna have a stroke lol
Landon Collins has been pretty quiet the last few minutes. Also, was Aaron Murray a broadcast journalism major, because he''s got a future on TV that''s dor sure.
I'm just going to pass out and call the Oklahoma vs. Georgia game as the national championship. 
Georgia at halftime: We want UCF
Uh oh ! 
Whomp Whomp
fucking shit... what in the hell
Bama better turn this shit around at half
Bama is killing themselves
This defense is shit. I hope for nothing but more pain for Tennessee.
I FUCKING HOPE SO
Ooooooo I don't have salami but I might have some summer sausage. 
Bama is shook. They ain't ready for prime time baby
Saban bout to blow a gasket!!!
Pruitt is looking really bad...
The magic of memes
Saban trying his secret maneuver: *cheating*
How awkward would it be to have to defend your brother in the National Championship Game?
I'm oretty hyped to see the Black Panther preview. Love me some Marvel movies
Sucks don't it Nick.
Hurts, doesn''t it 
Yeah, for Omega Psi Phi. It's a big thing for the fraternity.
If I was a Georgia or Bama fan I'd tell her no. I couldn't get a boner right now if I tried 
Saban bout to lose his damn mind. 
Fade me fam.
Flair up.
Ah yes, the rare "double drop"!Seems about right for this game.
we shall take those 5 yards, thank you very much 
Fromm is erratic at best this game
Alternatively, there is a [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/KendrickLamar/comments/7p3jh0/official_cfp_national_championship_halftime/) in r/kendricklamar for his performance.
Our offense is dog shit. 
If the opposing team does it and the offense jumps then the penalty is on the D. Happened to us once this year 
Wheels coming off for Bammer 
It had better memes too
bubble screens
Jesus dude you gotta hustle
Are you kidding me? There were a half dozen teams in CFB as good as Bama.  Their offense is a joke.  UCF would have put points up against UGA in the first half.  The Bama defense isn't even scary.This UGA team is good, but not great.  Fromm is playing a very up and down game.  Some nice throws and some trash throws.
Dude give it a rest. You look pathetic.
Wowee Kirby gonna make Saban retire PAULLLLL
God im loving this
Fromm and Hurts made a no-QB MVP pact.
I''m from Chicago and hadn''t even heard of Chick-Fil-A until my freshman year. Still haven''t eaten there though.
Sonyyyyyyy
That looked like targeting...
reminds me of a QB I had to watch every week this season
Damm this gsme are going by quick. Last year there was a commercial every other play
Georgia's run blocking is no fucking joke 
Fraternity branding. 
At least he can throw somebody open
Would you rather live in Alabama for the rest your life and have your favorite team win the National Championship every 5 years, or live anywhere else and have your team never win the National Championship? 
Not watching this game but wanted to see wtf is going on with the current score.. Is the game a snoozefest? Lots of errors? How it it 0-6?
He's not even gonna make an NFL roster
It's a flag for the D to try.
This is the second college game I've ever watched after the Rose Bowl and I must say the two games were very different 
Boring ass game. No offense.
As a Bama fan, I don't know if I pull for us to win the game, or pull for us to be shutout so something gets fucking done about our offense. Brian Daboll needs to go back to the NFL.
A foot race to the end zone? He fell trying to make the interception 
Has Nick Saban lost control?!
Has Saban ever been shut out at the half before?
Jake Fromm: not quite as good as Stafford.
I'm liking this so far
:)
It's only the fourth time they've done it.  
8k comments is not very big.edit: For context, Game 7 of the 2016 World Series was a 85K comment thread and performed fine.
I really hate that. More than either of y''all''s teams. 
Notes from the first half:Riley Ridley looks really good, he could be really good in the next 2 years.I feel bad for Calvin Ridley. Man that team just cannot use him properly.Alabama just looks really really fucking slow on offense. Feels like they just won a bunch of games this year by being physically bigger than their lesser opponents and grinding them down.Also Georgia running backs are amazing.
Sony Michel is the truth
Thanks big guy.
Showing what a Ridley can do with a quarterback who can actually throw.
listen here u lil leprechaun
Ayee he broke free
I don't think Bama is built to come from behind to win
I''d assume because the bands play on the field at the half. I was hoping they''d pull a Peter Pablo in Drumline instead of just putting him outside
Ffs you're not playing prime Vikings Adrian Peterson here, just shut him down and get off the fucking field
great pitch 
He goes from standing still to panic every play. 
No their just really good
We are in trouble fellas. Can''t get off the field on third down. Also have no offense, not hard to stop the run when you know hurts can''t throw the ball.
UGA has the best backfield in the country.But Swift may end up better than Chubb/Michel.But then they also have 3 of the best qb prospects in the country.Dawgs are loaded.
Next year my friend
Is this Saban handing the baton to his protege before he announces his retirement? 
Sony is a man possessed! 
Are you suggesting there's a reason why he's a former head coach?
>I have no faith in Hurts
This is not a characteristic game for a Saban coaches team. Bodes well for Georgia.
Man this has been great playcalling by Georgia too
I love this game
Michel is so fun to watch
We're going to end up with threads for possessions, aren't we?
Fromm needs to center himself
Watching Fromm is legit painful 
Those are the kind of penalties that just infuriate you as a coach 
nah Hurts is doing way worse.   but Fromm throws almost every ball behind the reciever or flat out misses.
this game is a bit of a snoozer
Yes, I believe.> ARTICLE 3. Catch, Interception, Recovery >> To catch a ball means that a player:>> * Secures control of a live ball in flight with his hands or arms before the ball touches the ground, and        Touches the ground in bounds with any part of his body, and then
Grilled cheese n bacon 
Will the score end up 31-0?
Get shwifty
Bama defense is tired
I miss General Sherman. 
So many drops.........
Oh boy Saban is about to go ballistic 
Hahaha what a dumb move 
[deleted]
Bama better watch out cause Georgia is coming down field
He''s also missed at least 4 easy throws 
great play call, love love love!
This happened for my Packers this year. Everyone was crucifying McCarthy when he had Brett Hundley. Ths only worse QB was Deshone Kizer. Did everything he could to not have him throw more than 10 yards.
Nah. The undefeated season was a great accomplishment, as was beating Auburn, but Auburn had already been exposed by UGA. If anything Oklahoma should be here over Bama
[deleted]
Fromm is making some pretty wild throws
Yo Bama whatchu want on that 3rd and long?                            Just fuck my shit up fam.
None taken
Alabama moar like Assabama
Alabama is a joke
They get it free, I beleive.
I am ready for TUA TIME
Dawgs getting 6 here 
He needs to sit on the bench 
Still not relevant to the game we're watching
Bama really hasn't looked good enough to win this game 
Fromm looks rough but he''s not trash. Chill the fuck out on that. 
I seriously can't handle this. How does Michel keep running the fucking ball?
THANKS, DAD
Up in here up in here
Saban isn''t gonna do it. He''s either too proud to acknowledge that his faith in Hurts is wrong or he sees some weird intangible quality that we just don''t get. 
let's go DAWGS!
It's because he really is playing bad. They need to put in Tua if Hurts doesn't wake up in 3Q.
Bama has no real offense, they get by on talent and size.
We have a long way to go
Jalen Hurts get shook, the just shuts down the rest of the game. They need to consider benching him, because he isn't going to get it done. 
Georgia is the only team that can match up with Bama o line and contain Hurts.  Every team tries but none could except Georgia
Come on put Kendrick already
Man, this is Miss St. all over again, only this time we're facing a far better team.
move along.
That is a horrible thing to wish upon a person!!
OR NOT HAVE TWO TEAMS FROM THE SAME CONFERENCE IN A 4 TEAM PLAYOFF SERIES.
They are both WRs
Alabama makes games boring not the SEC dawgs with a thriller in Pasadena 
3rd and long right where they want us (this has been the 3rd installment of this comment)I will update as our defense continues to give us false hope that they can stop someone within 30+ ft.
It''s funny that Swift is actually very fast 
Probably omega symbols. Some historically black fraternities brand their members
ssshhh. You're supposed to pretend he's amazing and just trash Hurts every chance you get. 
I am still just happy that our D has had so much time to rest in the first half.
not sure darnold has won a NC before.
This is turning into a nice drive.
Miss Kiffin?
Now I'm just thinking of the mayor from o brother where art thou
This game so far:Calvin Ridley's little brother vs Alabama's Punter
Maybe this game will be the kick in the pants the committee needs to fix their shit.
True.
Dynasty bros, you're letting me down! :(
Landon Collins looks like he wanted to punch Joe Tessitore when shoved his finger in his face lmao 
Go Knights
Not sure who you''re speaking about but Omega is a prominent African American fraternity known for branding an Omega symbol on brothers. Probably what you saw. 
If Atlanta can give up a 28-3 lead, I have no doubt that Athens can give up a 9-0 lead
Welcome to the club. 
Trueeee
We're losing because our qb could hit the ocean from a boat
which do you like?  I've tried some, but haven't found a great one.
Is this the worst combined QB performance in a national championship game?
0-9 at the half at best. FUCK.
They really cant stop the run. Why doesnt UGA do it more often
Man I like UGA but their fans have been insufferable dicks on here lately 
I''m guessing his frat. Omega omega? They do that scar thing in some frats 
Kirby out coaching Saban in the first half
Commentators are so fucking biased to bama
Dawgs absolutely gotta have a td 
Did we just quick snap Nick Saban with the wrong amount of men on the field? Fromm just Aaron Rodgers'ed Nick Saban.
How? They've given up 6 points lol and he has absolutely zero help from the offense to give his guys a rest.
First down threads
The stream is so far behind the broadcast holy shit
@WFANTrades: There were mid December afternoon ESPN Bowl Games in front of 400 people more exciting than this one. Let''s go heah.
If Alabama loses this game, especially if it''s a blowout, that could force Saban into the NFL.Like I know a lot of teams have been looking at him and he did have 1 Okay season in the NFL so I wouldn''t be surprised if he does make the leap. Edit: 1 Okay season in the NFL. 
idk he's attempting a lot of risky throws even on nfl type plays but just not putting enough on the ball
I've always said Michel will be better than Chubb in the NFL.
people hate defense but i''m loving this game. go dawgs
Georgia planning on using the middle of the field at all with 3 timeouts?
I really did not expect Fromm to outplay Hurts this game.
commercials are full time silly
DUMPSTER FIRE, WE HAVE A DUMPSTER FIRE.
Daboll and Jalen can share a shit smoothie for letting the defense get gassed. 
At this point we're just giving championships to teams who haven't had one in 30+ years. All about that charity.
I mean.. I'm not saying we *won't*..
Thanks
This is a game for Alabama where you really wish your QB could do something more than what Hurts does. 
Get down dude
Why the fuck was that dude meandering off the field not even walking fast much less running!!!!!!?
Knoxville > Living in a trailer 
THEY AINT PLAYED NOBODY
Nope. Just a hot MN team against a lazy Cle tonight
I bet Joey Freshwater is freakin loving this performance...
Saban halftime interview words spoken: 7.O/U?That *might* have been more than 7 words. Idk, I'm an FSU alum, I can't count
That''s my quarterback. 
That FG target line should have been placed on the other side of the 50. Goggles is superhuman !
What about live in Alabama and have your team lose to UCF :(
Literally no way either of these QBs gets picked up in the early round of the draft. If they declare themselves for the draft.Edit: admittedly I know nothing about them outside of Hurts (Hurtz?) being in the game last year. Fromm is a freshman so he wouldn''t go in this years draft. But still, these QBs just do not look good at all. But I never watch CFB, stick to the NFL so maybe I''m wrong
Thanks
Who was saying bench Fromm? Because damn that was a good run.
A lot of black fraternities brand their members during initiation(completely voluntary. Not everyone gets them). That''s likely what he has with the double omega. But I have a couple black friends that have brands of various Christian symbols. It''s basically a tattoo just more painful and more visible
Oh sorry. It's just a sec game. My mistake. Easy to confuse the two...
Saban didn't get enough time to prepare for this game, at least this first half. Compared to the semi-final, this is like playing on a Thursday after a Monday game to him. His players aren't use to resting for less than 5 weeks.
great run Fromm, WOOT WOOT!!!!!!!!!!
THATS MY QB
Georgia lookin dominant  Edit: WOOF
RIP whoever Saban sacrifices at halftime. 
Jake "Wheels" Fromm
JAKE FROMM
Saban is going to commit murder over Kendrick Lamar''s dulcet tones
Earlier I said that "Offense chokin".I'd like to retract that and say that the entire team is chokin.
JAKE FROMM PUTTING HIS BODY ON THE LINE
I would take Dukes qb right now. Just somebody who can complete a fucking pass.
Too bad y'all couldnt win right? 
GIVE US ANOTHER FG!
God dammit Rayquon
Huntsville isn't bad. Auburn is wonderful. The rest is pretty ass. Not quite "Panama City Ass" though
We gonna get some holding calls or nah?
The one time I root for Alabama...
Hahahahahaha
lol man, I'm not even watching right now, just shit-posting y'all's second all SEC-BS-nobody-gives-a-fuck trophy. 
I have no idea how Alabama is going to score at all in the second half unless something major changes. 
Fromm channeling his inner MariGOATa 
White Michael Vick 
I could beat this team
And that's the running game being brought in.
Bama D gonna run out of gas in the 4th quarter at this rate.
Go ahead and downvote me Bama fans, but I don't feel like we have a chance. Bring in Tua, our defense can only do so much. They have Jalen figured out and he can't overcome his limitations. They're converting every freaking long 3rd down conversion and we can't sustain any drives. We are getting gassed and later we will get gashed. This is 2016 all over again, except they have even more film on Jalen. I am very frustrated by this performance.
... Someones doing running drills when they get back.
DONT GET HURT
White QB running!
There you go Fromm! Commit to the run!
Pls slide bby thx
Georgia fans, should I start hoping?
I think it''s a QB problem, not an o-line problem. 
I'm glad we rushed the snap on 3rd down and threw an incomplete pass to make sure they had plenty of time to drive down. 
Running all over Bama.
Fromm can run
The Reddit DDOS alarms are going nuts about now.
WOOT WOOT!!!!!!!!!!!!
Cmon Dawgs, finish this drive! Punch it in! 
"WE WANT BAMA!" -Tide fans, probably.
LOL Fromm just outran the bama D :P
Goggles is going to put the team on his back. GIVE THE MAN THE MVP.
You can''t doubt the guy''s balls, that''s for sure. 
This is not the timeline I signed up for.
Isn't every play a foot race to the ending?
he will probably put ESPN's affinity for Darnold to shame.
That's the hangup. It'd probably be cost prohibitive.
I'd say for UKs sake I hope not.....but I know it won't matter.
If the Dawgs shut out Alabama, OU deserves to be ranked 2nd at the end of the year. 
Auburn exposed by UGA, yet Auburn beat both UGA and Bama.Nah it should straight be UCF. 
He's got some wheels 
TD before the half pls. Thanks. 
1 minute ago: fuck FrommNow: I love Fromm 
What is this? Footy net ball? 
Trevor Knight or Jake Fromm?
Did chubb get hurt?
rescind all of Bama's championships after this POOR first half showing
THATS 6-0 YOU LUDDITE
MOM. AND YOU ARE WELCOME
I'm going to bed. Someone wake me up if Jalen Hurts figures out he needs to step up in the pocket, instead of running into other side of the pass rush...
Bamas d is going to get gassed 
W I D E  O P E N
It's amazing what you can do when focus all your shitposting energy on coaching quarterbacks.
UGA is taking small risks here and there and thats why they have some points on the board
I heard kendrick is opening with an evanescence cover 
Get the fuck away from goggles!
Jake “Michael Vick” Fromm
Nah
Fromm is a hella smart qb
Slide buddy, slide. Protect yourself. 
So think the offenses will offense after halftime? 
Is anyone finding a way to actually get WatchESPN to work half decent? This is MISERABLE
FROMM THE POCKET WITH A FIRST DOWN
HE'LL HAVE TO CONVERT TO RB/FB, OR HE'LL BE OUT OF THE LEAGUE BEFORE HIS ROOKIE CONTRACT IS UP.
I'd rather listen to musburger hit on AJ Mccarrons GF
UCF would've scored 50 by now
FROMM ON AN OPEN FIELD NED
Jake "Blake Bortles" Fromm
13-0 at half would be amazing 
Guess who got all the answers for who has played for the national title at this shitty trivia night? This fuckin guy. Where is my beer.
DEFENSE!  SEC FOOTBALL!  
Even though I''m an OU fan I love ball control and slowly marching down the field.  We do it to an extent, but there''s nothing like getting under center and fucking up the other team.
Nick saban will be the color of the bulldogs jerseys when he's yelling at his team at half. 
*RUNNING BACK FROMM*
Slide dude no reason to take an unnecessary hit
If you leave defensive players on the field during the hurry-up, it will fuck up the offense way more than if you try to substitute.
Anywhere else easy question
Already out of gas, this defense is shit
The Alabama back hit his own teammate more than Fromm lol
Yep. Georgia smoked us when we played them.
Jake the Snake.
He is inconsistent but he has been pretty clutch.
Fromm is a beast honestly 
let's go dawgs, great drive, now get this touchdown
BAMA HAS NO BUSINESS  BEING HERE
Georgia has all the momentum right now. Just get us to halftime.
Fire Daboll
Losing.
Fuckin' Fromm!
We've been saying that about Alabama's backs since Saban got there.
Let me introduce you to the Purple Cobras.Laser, Blazer, and know my assistant, MICHEL. 
Such a low scoring game. It isn't bad football, but it isn't exciting either. 
snap count.  I know you're used to basketball, but when your D is on the field for a long time they start to get tired.  This is going much like last year. 
Great from Fromm stepping up. 
Jake, dude, please slide! Don''t want you to get hurt! <3
running?  no
No way in hell he goes back to the NFL
Step up your posting velocity. I mean REALLY get in there okay? 
Fuck you guys, I love Fromm. 
Shut up Vanderbilt 
dude what it is, what IT is that makes a QB great, Georgia QB's got it.
Dual Threat QB 
Fromm is a true freshman. So I don''t think that''s an issue for him. 
JAKE FROMM STATE FARM
Too much football, you know you want a commercial break ESPN
"Look at the shoulders on that...bass"
BAMA IS GASSED AS FUCK
This is going to be a tough comeback if Georgia score a TD on this drive.That said, if anybody can do it it is Alabama.
Subscribe. 
pls get a TD here Georgia
**OH BOY FIELD GOAL RANGE**
HSO we would beat Bama. 
People forget that he is also a true freshmen, going up against a really good defense in Bama too. 
Fromm is a true freshman 
You really gotta feel for Bama tonight
How many words is a cold stare
Fromm is a true freshman, so I doubt he's gonna try and get drafted this spring
[deleted]
I Georgia could score before the end of the half, that would be really nice.
To be fair he''s had an alright first half 0 TD with an INT
me next pls
Jesus Alabama really giving the world reason to believe that Wisconsin should've had their spot.
Is it just me or does this game really make the reality of UCF winning the CFP seem a hell of a lot more plausable. I mean holy hell these teams are playing like crap.
Y''all see that Georgia Water girl? 
Fromm is a freshman
Pretty sure Fromm can't go anyway
We're already getting gassed. Our offense has left them out on the field this whole fucking half.
Neither of them can declare...
Thanks for that insight, Iowa state. 
Georgia has some beautiful uniforms, but I'm biased towards those colors.
Gotta score a TD.
Totally agree. This is how you get close games in the 4th quarter, which is what everyone really wants. 
No thats Blake Bortles. 
Lol. I'm an archery technician at an archery pro shop. It's a dream job for me. 
Fromm is everything Bama wants Hurts to be.
They've run out of commercials!
95 total yards? yikes 
UCF they beat Auburn who is the only team to beat Georgia.
Aye Georgia that water girl is cute js! ;)
Careful, it's Atlanta. We actually could have a dumpster fire.
I mean Fromm is a freshman so 
If this game resembled the \#2 Bama - \#1 LSU snoozefest any more, they'd run it back again next week for a natty.
I blame Daboll and Hurts. 
One was one of the greatest games ever played.The other one is this one.
Hahahaha. Easy. I'd rather my team go 0-12 every year than live in Alabama. 
True freshman. Big stage.
Are you sure about that? Hurts never really had an arm.
Exactly. Imagine the hype they''d put into him 
The story is Jalen Hurts isn''t that good
Fuck a field goal go for 6
I'm not pretending that you're being remotely objective. He's a true sophomore in his second title game and #2 all time in TDs for Alabama. 
Damn. I'm missing Lane Kiffin right now.
Fade me.
Easy under
Pls touchdown dawgs 
Obvi
No, your qb isn't.
I imagine bama fans feel a bit like we did right about this time last week
Maybe losing Kirby Smart did more damage to Bama than originally thought.
She's purdy.
STATE FARM
fuck i would so love a touch down going into half
Aside from that one little mistake Georgia has controlled this game.  And they only lead by six at the moment.  Second half should be crazy.  You know, around midnight when it starts...
This ref's communication skills are 10/10. Big 12, step up. Why can't we have nice things?
Where''s  this coming fromm? I''ll show myself out.
This game would have zero offense if both these teams learned to keep a LB in as a QB Spy
Fromm looking great for a freshman
Nice run by Fromm
Fuck a slide! This is the Natty LETS GO FROMM
21 pass yards. Yeah, might be time for a change. 
You say, send me proof 
Garnet and gold Bama logo looks good
Seen her every week
Fromm is a freshman so... I dont think hes declaring.
Oh no Fromm....you gotta learn to slide. 
Saban is known to be a decent coach I reckon he'll make some adjustments
*State Fromm
Ballsy run 
I''m enjoying it 
Fromm is a true freshman. How do you expect him to play against an elite defense? And how would he declare regardless?
Reverse that first number and it is even more amazing *sobs in corner*
[deleted]
ROLL TI....OVER
Yes
If Harrison would''ve hit him alone, it''d been a replay of the 09 game. 
Championship Bama that has a month just to prepare for these two weekends is a lot scarier than mid season Bama. Not to mention Georgia
A touchdown here and a 13 point lead at half? Bama hasn't shown anything to suggest they're finding 14 points on offense tonight. 
Fire saban, hire les miles
Pics pls

COLLEGE KICKERS
*Triggers UCF Knights.*
I don't think a Sophomore and a Freshman are gonna declare
Man I can't defend Jalen anymore 
Dear Indianapolis Colts, We know you're gonna draft offense. You never draft what makes sense. So draft Michel or Chubb you asshats 
Yes
I think we actually watched the natty last week
He looks bad this game, yes, but it''s not like he''s a shit QB
KENNY G HALFTIME SHOW
4-HEADED MONSTER!
At least Ohio state isn't playing
Kinda poorly is spot on 
You and I clearly define "dominant" differently.
Bama does win the game of "more attractive trainers". We'll see how this affects the game later on.
Umm, why would you ever say no to this?
Please a TD no more FGs damnit
Honestly, you''re right.
Jesus apparently everyone on this sub conflates low scoring with boring.  I don't know how anyone is bored in this game, there is so much going on on both lines and with the play calling.
You got this DAWGS
UGA is eating Alabama alive.
[deleted]
Let's go Georgia!
A Georgia TD would be HUUGGGEE
It is NOT the Georgia defense or offense. It is ALL about Jalen playing like dog shit.
Wake me up
Or us 
How old is saban? I don't think he wants that at his age
Let's fuckin go jake fromm statefarm
Retirement at halftime confirmed
If bama fans not calling for Tua after half time something is wrong Hurts sucks
GODS I WAS A BULLDOG THEN
Football IQ: Fromm is very stable, i would say a genius. 
There was probably a present at the UGA Christmas party that said From: Fromm
Yeah we did. 
First half story is Jalen is ass 
What a joke. I can't be upset at our defense's performance. They've been on the field almost the entire game. The offense can't do anything
This is looking a lot like last year's fiesta bowl.  D getting tired and offense doing nothing. And missed field goals.
Well Fromm is a freshman so...
she's cute! :D
And notched a Super Bowl win too
oh daaaaaamn
We all know you''re right. This whole season has lived and died by Jalen. Don''t think it will change now
Fromm is a freshman and Hunts is a sophomore 
Streaming on roku here. It's trash. My internet is pretty budget too, though.
Fromm is a quarterback i could get behind. He is the fucking Truth!
The D is gassed. This game is over, just like Jalen's career
I sense bias
glad the bears (my team) made the great hire with nagy today. i don''t think saban''s philosophy works as well and the nfl but i think many gms would be intrigued. 
Is this a joke?
This is regrettably true.
Georgia is 16-1 when they lead at the half. Their one loss was to Tennessee. *Cue Celine Dion*
When's the last time Alabama didn't score in the first half of a game?
*oof*
Alabama is getting outclassed rn
Yes.
Fuck. Saban better make some great 2nd half adjustments.
Right behind UCF
Bama wins on a kick 6.You heard it here
As you age you have to leave a legacy of goodwill.
Is it Hurts or is it Daboll? Question of the season
Alabama's fans https://twitter.com/SBNationCFB/status/950558787521449990?s=09
Viewer "Hey that was a nice play. I'd like to see a replay!" Watch ESPN "Hold my beer."
DEWIT
No, it's a trick!
Saban killing spree while D.N.A plays in the background**
Jim Chaney where was this amazing play calling when you were working for us??????? 
[Jake Fromm like](https://youtu.be/GaqV9vVP2Yc?t=6)
Georgia looks REALLY good
"Sophomore younger brother", I believe.
So just the one?
You're my spirit animal 
HURTS THAT IS WHAT YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO DO.
"Terry, get me my whipping stick"
Zoo-wee mama
Lord, holes EVERYWHERE
Bama''s defense is prolly sick of being on the field the whole game rip 
OH MY GODwin
let's go BABY!!!!!!!!!!!! WOOT WOOT!!!!!!!!!!
Well, this is not going very well. 
Our defense is great. Offense sucks ass.
If Fromm keeps this up he''s gonna have his ball-bag immortalized in a bronze bust. 
At what point do you decide to bench Hurts? Dude is playing like trash. 
Has anyone thought about going into the end zone?
LETS GOO
Few people know this but Georgia''s colors are a tribute to WKU
Yay band!
You wouldn't have 30 yards of offense at this point 
Jalen reminds me of JT
It''s fucking suffocating. That dawg defense.  I''m expecting half time to result in saban dropping multiple fucks and earn your paychecks. If we don''t answer right away in the 3rd quarter then that''s gonna be it.
Same, I missed it
>pathetic >28-3>braves
Chub better be coming in 
Was looking for a mention 
Are you kidding me? There is such thing as a defensive game. Come on man.
Water girl. Damn 
I bet UCF would have at least got 7 by now. 
Yes you say yea
Ugh this is just like last year. Nothing on offense and defense is paying the price for it.
BY THE GODS
He's, like, pretty smart 
Over. 5 fake internet dollars on it!
Come on dogs
Get a QB who can throw. I''ve watched a lot of Bama games this year and have never been impressed with Hurts outside of his scrambles. It''s like he''s using the immense ability of his teammates to win.
hurts is fucking awful
"Well we're not executing... Fuck this."
Omg, there may be a TD this half!!!
Stupid, sexy Fromm
Or UGA's offense...
...but they can defend him!^im^sorry
another beautiful throw by Fromm
Jake Fromm is fucking really good. Wow.
BAMAS OUTMATCHED PAUL
If Alabama didn't have *that* defense this would be a lot worse
Fromm is balling out
If we lose, I hope the Steelers go down too. 2018 will be the year of the running QB
Pretty sure this is exactly what he was thinking too
UCF wouldn''t be able to last against the Georgia run game or defense 
QB fake/Zone read calling it
I miss having a game manager as a quarterback instead of this dual threat stuff
I would call a run here 
No holding being called at all unless you''re Bama, apparently.B1G refs still mad Ohio St ain''t playing tonight?
Gotta score a TD here
BENCH JALEN. THIS IS SO SAD. 
Hey, a Georgia WR caught it at the four, and managed to get out of bounds this time!
Wait for the half time adjustments, there have been bigger comebacks
That's on the MLB not shadowing.
Does Fowler just have a really shitty vantage point? He was clearly out way before the goal line.
Football would be more interesting if it was played by anime girls. You can't argue this.
Oh shit that water girl
Three plays to get in the endzonze if they play it right
Good thing Fromm went down a bit. Alabama DB was head-hunting.
Holy whistles
This drive is beautiful. 
JUST REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENS ON TURF STAYS ON TURF. WE GON PUNT IT IN REVERSE.
Knocking on the door who let the dawg's in?
I would take anyone who is willing to throw the ball deep at all
But Bama also blew out Clemson, so who knows
We at home drinking gin though which is almost just as good. Go Dawgs
Bama looks lost and frustrated 
Yes
I feel for Bama defense because if they had a somewhat decent qb they wouldn''t have to be on the field almost the entire game.
omg the whistles lol
If you don''t make a quarterback change at half, you aren''t serious about winning this game.Period.
Now what makes Nick Saben great are his adjustments in the second half. Let's see how he handles their struggling offense.
Chris Fowler is biased as fuck.  God I hate that guy.  
At least one of the teams has a proper offense 
http://wbir-download.edgesuite.net/video/2812981/2812981_Thumb.jpg
**HEAVY WHISTLING**
Our D is totally gassed. Jalen has just left them hanging out there to dry. 
Defense has to be tired. Bama play calling and execution has been horrible on offense. 
I need confidence advice from this Fromm guy. 
Hurt his shoulder, they already confirmed he'll return.
Well all throughout the pre-game they built him up like if he was the Heisman winner 
*Fromm's 2018 Heisman campaign hype intensifies*
Georgia should just bash Chubb up the middle 
Did ref slap swifts butt?
Fuck this, man. Embarrassing display on both sides of the ball. Pathetic.
ESPN almost missed a TD Live lol
Fromm isn't even old enough to order a beer and he's plowing head-first into Bama' defenders in front of millions of viewers. Pay these kids. 
Wild Dawg it 
Oh let's just run it up the middle that's worked for us so far of course
Bold 
That whistle medley was amazing 
That''s a lot of whistles 
Does Saban bench Hurts in a game like this?
Guys how the fuck did we beat Clemson 
Does Bama have any decent QB recruited?
Defense is sexy football
I'll take over.
I've had mixed results with it on Hulu in the past. I'd say the Appletv is noticeably faster than either of the others
Under.  He looks at the reporter and walks away.
6-0 in the SEC is 36-0 adjusted for Big 12 inflation
BLOW ALL THE WHISTLES
Whatever voodoo black magic shit Saban does needs to happen during halftime.  
Saban is going to sacrifice all sorts of small animals at halftime in some sort of football gods ritual. 
For real.  My butthole clenches so hard when he takes those hits.
90 total yards
Is there a prop bet on Saban killing someone tonight?
Was that enough whistles? 
Kenny G is performing a halftime show during The Dan Le Batard mega cast
a touchdown would be cool
what a laser from Jake, hot dam
Those whistles sounded like louder, shriller birds
Idk if Bama can score 14 points in the next 2 quarters...
Saban is going to have an entire Kendrick Lamar concert to round up every virgin in Georgia for the ultimate half time adjustment sacrifice
We can't come back from a 3 point lead.
Toss to Michel/Swift
Who wants the Lane Train back?
Always
See this is why everyone hates Alabama
Those 29 whistles tho
how many whistles tho
Where you at Bama? We scored 31 by now.
I guarantee you have never tried to defend Hurts before.
that makes me even more thankful i'm not in a frat lol
It is beautiful if you love defensive football and strategy.
Go dogs!!!!
Yep
Fromm > HurtsAnd it's really not that close.
defense is doing their job great. georgia has double the plays bama has. you can only play defense for so long
this has been the most entertaining drive of the game so far
We've had the ball for so much time.
Godwin! Godwin you Dawg! How in the hell did you make that catch??
I see nerves. It's a well defended game. 
Bama d is exhausted, gotta score here 
Man Fromm is clutch!
Use the alt streams like hometown radio calls. No stability issues.
Coaches Film Room
This game is **over** my dudes.
Godwin is good at football. This I can confirm.
Should I just go ahead and mentally prepare myself for grown men taking daily barking breaks? 
Raw Dawg em 
Right?
They might have lost, but they definitely would have put up some points.
A TD here would really open up the game in the 2nd half
Good eye by the zebra.
Refs sounded like a flock of birds with the whistles lol
I believe y'all spell it "dwags".
Alabama only has 95 yards... yikes
Did that seem like excessive using of whistles from the refs lol
After watching GAs D leak points like a seive to Okl, I'm stunned the team they play in the 'ship can't get a score 
Have they only lead at half in 17 games total?Something don't add up here son.
Pass -> Run -> Goggles9-0 halftime
hurry up i wanna see the bands and mr lamar
Wait, refs, why blow the whistle like that? The O line can push now
I mean ... WTF Alabama? 
get this TD Dawgs let's go
just a nice drive this has been 
I wasn't looking, why damn
"What was the line on this game, 6?'"No, that was the over-under." 
Will Saban use Tua?
I am ready
At least JT knows how to throw a football
I will definitely say that the refs are doin a damn great job tonight!
I know a good play to run against Bama about right now 
Holy whistles batman
W H I S T L E G A T E
GET EM DAWGS
No that shot is not what Kirk is referring to. 
Halftime probably
Catch
Game over. 
90 total yards....what a juggernaut...
I think I'm done with WatchESPN this shit is so bad 
Let the Kirby Smart dynasty begin! The rule of two Saban; its time for Kirby and Fromm to make Saban have a bunch more runner up trophies 
But Kirby is just as good at making those halftime adjustments. I'm fucking sweaty. 
He doesn't give us the best chance to win, he gives us the least chance to lose. Because he literally does nothing to turn the ball over, tua doesn't know the playbook or he'd easily take his spot 
Need more whistles pls
Not enough whistles 
"They'll stop him just short"Lol he was out at the 4
They need a score
No but he should.
**OF COURSE I WAS OVERCONFIDENT, I MEAN HAVE YOU MET ME? I''M ME!**
What''s all the whistles about? 
i think jalen hurts in playing like covfefe
Nah this is squarely on the offense.
Fuck a FG get the touchdown. YOUCANDOIT!
Tell them no. It makes no sense to get naked to wash your face.
What''s the twitter?
Well, bright side... maybe this will prove Jalen is not the future for this team
Can't blame our D. They've been abandoned by Jalen and our offense.
Why you gotta do this, Idaho 
Just started watching and looks like I''ve missed nothing lol
Do we score and go for 2 
Georgia just want it more right now. Bama need a halftime break.
We did have a ballin offense under him. It was the defense that was God awful.
Seattle says throw the ball.
Switch over to the "Sounds of the Game" stream 
We fucking suck
"Don't want to get your clothes wet"
Just make the playoff and we'll lose a game and then you're golden.
ESPN's production quality is such shit. Almost missed that play.
You good fam?
Make our dreams come true 
He''s just mad cause the only nudes he gets is his cousins 
He stepped out of bounds.
you're trying too hard
Teams have been looking at him. Yeah I know it''s not likely but it''s definitively a possibility. 
*WHISTLES*
Anymore whistles to blow ref?
YOU MUST CONSTRUCT ADDITIONAL PYLON CAMS!
I don't know if Bama can score in the next 2 quarters
Auburn beat Georgia at home in a rivaly game. You really think UCF would beat UGA or OU on a neutral site?
Ditto
Okay I think we got that the whistles needed to be blown
"We're gonna need the pylon cam to see if he stepped a whole foot or 11 inches out of bounds."
*Hurts Runs the ball for first down* - "Man, so great!  Sometimes you gotta keep it simple.  How about this great playcalling from bama."*Fromm Runs the ball for first down* - "Terrible play calling here by Georgia.  Takes a hit, way too risky"Kirk Herb...your obsession with Bama is creepy boo.
I think the refs need to blow the whistle a bit more
No Kirk, no one is wondering
Don''t you dare commercial me here ESPN 
Whatever happens in the second half, I''m so fucking proud of this Georgia team!
God if we can pitch a shutout...
True dat
But the PHONE WALLPAPER!
Whatever our game plan is, just burn that shit as sacrifice in the locker room.
Good lord chill with the whistles
I miss playing the tired championship Bama defense. 
fade me Fromm
im fucking bored.
Nice one refs. 
That was not a push...
*whistle whistle whistle*
I've seen the left side of Bama's line hold a *lot* tonight. Relax dude they're not calling it on anyone.
He also never really looked this trash and Fromm is a true freshman.
And prolly like physical-space-prohibitive
So many whistles
The whistles are player of the game. 
Fuckin fade me
#6 for 6?
It's one half. I know you guys aren't used to having fewer points than the other guys but there are two more quarters lol
I FEEL THE H8THE DAWG WITHIN ME FEELS IT
Why is there so much whistlinggggg
Fromm you crazy motherfucker
Holy shit nice
BuT HeS JuSt a FReShMaN
Middle third quarter 
This game isn't going anything like I thought it would.
Shut up Herbie he never stepped out.
This game really should be more than a 1 possession game. Georgia have been dominant. 
Georgia is Bama but with a good qb. 
Dawgs runnin through em like shit through a tin horn, man. 
toot toot motherfuckers it's whistle time
Refs playing a whistle symphony
Incoming James Winstone sub
Oh shit how did they not catch that out of bounds 
Doesn't matter if he stepped out on his own at this point. Already ran the play.
lmao garrison i admire your tenacity and optimism
Toss or fade pls 
Wims is in
That sounds badass! 
Hope they go for 2
Chooo! Chooo!
Sony would definitely break edge contain but idk if Taylor could handle the hit. 
Does Saban change his shirt at half?
Counted about thirty whistles. 
It's not Hurts' fault. He was fantastic as a freshman, outside of the Washington game and about 55 minutes of the Clemson game. He should've progressed, but he didn't. That isn't Hurts, that's Daboll's problem.
This game is feeling WAY too much like Falcons vs. Patriots...
Just a bunch of offensive minded nerds
Fromm takes home a Heisman before he leaves UGA. 
Just score and kick the PAT. Don''t get greedy.
Wtf was Kirk talking about?
Hurry up and score so I can watch the halftime show.
IT WAS A PICK PLAY PAWWWWL
Bama gonna lose and I'mma be hungover tomorrow at work. Life is perfect!
Wims is back!!!
More whistles than a Mexican rave 
Don't worry, TV will provide plenty of breathers
Let me know when the defense shows up on a 3rd and long.
Why does it matter if he stepped out on his own? The ball would be placed there no matter what
Whistles upon Whistles 
Pick play pls
Them dawgs is hell 
No not at all
Holy crap. What's up with the hundreds of whistles?
They're putting enough pressure on him to make him poop his pants
I don't know what you are taking about.
Fromm is quickly becoming my new favorite CFB player. 
What's up with that empty section?
The main ESPN stream sucks. But try the hometown radio feed. Same broadcast, less people streaming it, plus hometown radio broadcasters instead of ESPN announcers!Other option I like is the sky cam or the sounds of the game stream. Sounds of the game is great cuz it''s the same video feed of the main stream, but all you hear is the crowd, the bands, and the PA announcer!
Big if true
Wait what. You can just come back in bounds now?
Shit they called it, bold.
I think we've been calling for Tua since the middle of the season.
That''s also true, you need to a way of spreading Georgia out like their doing to you
I''m gonna get the last post on this thread.
It's obv hurts. You guys had 2 first downs last championship 
I respectfully disagree. I've seen several holds on bama. 
I'm referring to their insistence on throwing the ball into the turf rather than players in the same uniform. 
Fucking chill with the whistle 
Go QB draw!!
The dynasty is over 
People just don''t like defensive games. If the teams aren''t scoring TDs almost every drive then the game is boring. I played defensive line and watching these two teams go at it in the trenches is just as entertaining as watching teams drop 50 on each other (like PAC-12 fans are accustomed to). This is SEC football. Defense wins championships.
SEC football is boring as fuck to watch
Punch it in plz
Nah, it was close but he was in.
W H I S T L EHISTLE
If Alabama''s offense can just NOT BE TERRIBLE they can still win this game. 
Stop fucking saying tuddy
too tall
Bama should just recruit better athletes imo obvs these ones can't handle SEC SPEED
No, unless Tua goes in Jalen is fucking ruining us
It was clear as day he stepped out of bounds and the announcers are pretending they didn't see that. 
Guarantee Saban makes adjustments at halftime. We better get these 6 while we can
10 quarters 
They keep doing that same thing and Alabama isn''t able to close out their running game? Keep this up and they will switch to expecting runs and Georgia will start throwing it.Chess not checkers BAMA
Summer sausage and cheese curds
not with Hurts they can't 
RUN IT
And then Tua announces her is transferring after Saban refuses to play him?
Simply put, they are even worse than you guys. 
My....my word, I just realized: we're about to hold Alabama to <100 total offensive yards and 0 points for the first half. We....we're out 'Bama-ing Bama this half 
They better not pull a Seahawks
Bittersweet 
Couple more rubs and it'll be hard again 
FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCKFUCK FUCK FUCK FUCKFUCK FUCK FUCK FUCKFUCK FUCK FUCK FUCKFUCK FUCK FUCK FUCKFUCK FUCK FUCK FUCKFUCK FUCK FUCK FUCKFUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK
United States vs Alabama
If only I had a dollar for every redditor refreshing the new page right now waiting for the halftime thread
Can i get a gif of the Georgia dude spraying water all over his head
Throwing? Wtf
Quick Bama tag in ucf! Jk jk I'm sure Saban will come up with something in the second half.
*cough* Eason you gotta transfer 
If you guys aren't watching the coaches film room, I highly recommend it. Gary Patternson isn't on this time, but hearing from all of them is really really fascinating. It's Sumlin, Cutcliffe, Bobo, Luke, Fitzgerald and Gundy. Great stuffEDIT: Theres also basically no commercials
Ayyy
LOL
no turnovers.  that's big
Still wondering that myself.
I feel like running up the middle in the redzone is not usually the most effective against that Bama front 7...But hey I'm no coach.
YES!
Why can't Saban recruit QBs?
She got so much screen time during the OSU/Bama Sugar Bowl...not that I'm complaining
No, but I do think they deserve the #2 ranking since they did not get to prove it on the field. 
RIP Bama 
Tweet
Now I want to see what happened in that 08 Tulane game
Kirby straight up looks like this rn https://memegenerator.net/img/images/7916442.jpg
Lol
Watching some of our games made me think otherwise but this has been great tonight. 
lol bama you shootin yourself in the foot
So GA fans. How's it like having a great QB?
*Whistles at the Georgia water girl* ;)
Half time show came early
Whoops
UGA has Alabama on lockdown almost as bad as Tulane in 08. 
Some say they are still whistling the play dead to this day...
Herbie sticking to that Georgia receiver stepping out of bounds before the catch in face of contrary video evidence. Bold.
“Look at dis... look at this Alabama” 
I mean, defensively you're ok. There's just no offensive creativity and that's what's seriously wrong so far.
The Bama implosion is real.
Does everyone in the damn stands have a whistle?!
Oh boy Saban is gonna be livid.
anyone else think OU woulda beat Bammer? 
Oh geez.  
Fromm is so damn inaccurate 
New set of downs baby 
Blow my whistle baby whistle baby
woot woot
The fuck bama?!
Woo bama d getting frustrated
Yeah I'm so fucking confused 
How stupid 
LOLOLOL 
right now, I think you can do whatever you want.
I would tear off my dick to get a QB as good as Fromm at Michigan
Bama your defense is dipshits today
Sloppy for a saban team. 
Sabans gonna chew some ass
I'm not saying that Alabama is a sham that doesn't belong in this game, but I bet a conference champion puts up a better fight.
They've never had a real QB
well that was a dumb penalty
Hahahahaha roll tide pawwwwl
Roughing?You fucking idiot.
Let's get more flags 
Whistling intensifies
Can you make a thread for commercial saltiness and also one for shitty WatchESPN streaming complaints? That''s pretty much covers this whole thread at this point...
Oh shit
huh, so that's what it's like to benefit from a lucky call 
This Bama team is falling apart in front of our eyes.
We're going to Georgia Georgia in the 2nd half.
Hahah
Lmao idk if I''m enjoying Kenny g on lebatard or Georgia fuckin Alabama up more
fuck yeah, let's go
Dan LeBetard is gonna have Kenny G do the halftime show. Lol. 
What a dumbass
Saban has lost control of Bama
FIX THE REVERB
What a complete meltdown by Bama
never would have thought this was how this game would look at halftime after that first possession int
Classy.
should have underthrown that one too
Phone booths 
I kicked her bitch ass off the couch. She tried to take my entire seat when I got up for a drink. 
Okay, explain it to me.  Why are they so fixated on whether he stepped out of bounds or was pushed?
Yes, Bama. Let the dirty flow through you. 
No matter what, we need to go into halftime with a 2 score lead
yup
Huh? Not a good call
It's true. 
lmao that was stupid as hell
You fucking dumbass
What a terrible late hit
Same player with that ridiculous hold on the punt right?
What a dumb motherfucker.
Even when I root for Alabama I still lose
Fucking idiot
A N G R Y S A B A N
Jesus 14
Please don't touch da child
Saban is sacrificing Thompson at half time
Horrible idea to give whistles to the first 30,000 fans...
If Georgia somehow shuts out Alabama this sub is going to be fucking lit
YOU STUPID FUCK
Yeah, that was stupid 14
Run it down their throats 
Dumbass play
That''s how Georgia fans have felt all year. This was supposed to be an 8 win year. 
I think we could have beat bama.
Holy shit 14 u dumb 
Oh fuck, big penalty
WHAT A IDIOTTT
What a dumb penalty
I hate both of these teams, but BAMA is being fucked by the refs 
I mean considering GA's offense has been on the field for like 20 minutes the first half it speaks to Bamas D that they only have 6 points
I've said it once and I'll say it again.  Georgia deserves to be at the championship game.  Bama deserves diddly.  Ohio State was robbed.
Bad hit by bama 
OU did prove it on the field though. 
Alabama is shooting themselves in the foot all game
Is Herby having a stroke???
Weak
Saban is going to fire both of them.
What are you referring to?
Difference in clock stoppage?  I honestly don't know, but I know they changed something with that a couple of years ago.
All those whistles are so we don't have to reset the clock. Sometimes those clock operators need some help...
Please keep us updated
Alabama needs to chill, halftime couldn't come at a better time.
"Dominance"
lmao stupid hit
That was a flop though, dumb
Done. But don't worry I'm rooting for the Dawgs tonight. 
Upset Saban is like porn
Oh that was just fucking stupid by the Alabama player. Hands them the TD, potentially
Lol he tried to look like he didn't know where he was going
Saban is...not happy.
what a stupid penalty by the DB
They just said he did lol 
Blankenship is shook 
jeez, how many big penalties is this against Bama already?this is like, the least Bama-like thing I think I've ever seen
Good call
Saban is going to be out for some butts at half.
Saban's gonna be real mad about that penalty 
Saban not going to be happy about that.
Replays were not showing what Herbie was talking about
Well that was just fucking stupid.
u memester
Dumb dumb dumb play. Four steps away you can't hit him period
I''m going to drop kick every player of the Bama team that isn''t JK Scott stop with these penalties
Tulane *does* have a vicious defense.
Second that 
 NUMBER 14 YOU BRAIN DEAD FOOL
Wild dawg!
Saban's reaction says it all 
*whistles*
AWFUL CALL
Shit I missed it 
That was dumb. Easy call to make. 
Fuck you Nick
I've never seen a Saban team make so many stupid mistakes in a big game 
Wild dawg
GUYS,  WE ONY HAVE 12 SECONDS TO GET 1100 COMMMENTS
Not malicious but you can't do that.  Stupid.
Fromm the flopper
He had a TO on like the first drive.
Nick Saban about to eat him alive 
GAAAAAAAAD DAMMITNick Saban, most likely.
You're in the NCG.
This has gotta be the most undisciplined Bama has played in quite awhile 
Where are the commercials? 
Can we export Hurts?  Tennessee, you want him?
Perhaps he stepped out on the route. 
2 safeties and fg
Holy fucking christ Bama. You''re really shooting yourselves in the foot
Backflip pls.
Fuck yes give me more angry Saban I'm filling up my spank bank tonight
How is Alabama this undisciplined?
Touchdown!!! Fromm Georgia With Love
I'll never get tired of an angry nick saban
This might be the most undisciplined game I've ever seen Bama play
Fromm was born in 98, holy fuck I'm old
NICK SABAN HAS LOST CONTROL OF BAMA!
TOUCHY
Can I get Nick Saban's reaction as a gif?
Why? How? Wha? 
Only one team playing defense tonight. 
Hes saying that because thats not his MO. No reason to hurt your best qb. He needs to slide there. 
Dont be salty....... you know you guys vs these teams would be a win.... wait you guys have already done it <3
Let me know when our offense doesn't 3 and out.
Dang
We all would, to be fair
Bands? 
Bama, what are you doing bby
Goooooooooo Dawgs
“Damn it” -Nick Saban
Probably where a marching band was
I feel like I''m not even watching Bama play. A bunch of dumb shit happening. 
Don't worry Bama defense, the Michigan defense knows your pain. Offense completely hanging you out to dry
I''m not used to a sloppy Bama
Touchdown!!!!!!!!!!!
He aint here to play school
Thompson what the fuck
I lold
I was thinking TE.  But man the media shitstorm would be unbearable if Alabama benched their QB who lost only 2 games in 2 years.
WILD DAWG!
What an idiot. 
So what''s the Georgia QB situation next year? Do they have a battle between Fromm and Eason or do they just stick with Fromm?
No shit. I figured UGA would get killed, so the season would look like another failure of the Big 12, since they beat OU.This game is making OU look like they were accurately ranked at #2.
We could definitely match their offense
TD DAWGS!!!
#DAWG POWER
SUBSCRIBE
Bama defense so shit lolololol
They them dawgs
He was out and it wasn't even close. His whole foot was out with at least 6 inches to spare.
ZE DAWGS
WOW
[During the commercial break maybe you could flair up like your ex's herpes?](https://flair.redditcfb.com/)
What penalty? Nvm, my tv is behind 
Yeah, Alabama is going to have to come out swinging or the game might be over by then. Or at least get a drive and keep the defense off the field. 
WILD BULLDOG
Stop with the bloody whistles.
Nut
Fuck ALABAMA
What a play
HUUUUGGGGE!!!
POINTS
WOOOOOOOFFFFFFF
Where's that at? 
Lol Bama fans so unused to penalties they boo an obvious one 
Bama is playing sloppy now and Saban sees it
lol fuck Bama 
LETS FUCKING GO
Do you know what time of possession is?
furk
Niiice
When the Dawgs score, I think yes
Awesome playcalling by Bulldogs. nice drive wow!
Got enough for 2 plays before the half. C'mon Georgia!

Be careful Georgia, you've been here before
FUCK YEAH GO DAWGS
DAWGS
Alabama is doo doo.
Great play call there.
Bama is shook
Woot! Go Dawgs! 
That's game, man. I have zero faith in this team. 
Touchdown!!! Fuck yeah that's what you get for sucker pushing the QB.
Go for 2?
Hell yeah. 
#THE DAWGS ARE BARKING!!!
Beautiful fucking play lol!
You have more faith than I do.
I think he didn''t know that the receiver had the ball. You can come back in to catch it if you''re pushed out first. 
B L I M P W O R T H Y
***FINISH HIM***
Hell of a half by georgia
LET'S FUCKING GOOOOOOOOO
I remember when Bama was a polished team. What happened, Saban?
Wild Dawg! 
Yay go dawgs. 
!!!!!!!!!
That's Alabama's D that's flopping
Gg rival win incoming fml
Saban has a bald spot the shape of a comm headset
*GOBBLES DAWGINGLY*
DILLY DILLY!!!
Bama looks sloppy
[deleted]
They wanted more commercials and missed the opportunity to show more.
12-0 BOYS LET'S GET THAT TWO POINT CONVEY
Can someone start a state petition in Minnesota to recognize UCF as national champions? Dayton needs to get all over this, fair is fair.
great drive, Dawgs!
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!
Dick move Thomson. 
Georgia scored the 1st TD!
TD DAWGS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
That was a good play call
Early Cuyler is so happy right now.
All too easy
Go 4 2
THEM DAWGS
Lol
Yes TD
G O O D B O Y E S
UGA made bama look embarrassing on that entire drive. 
Woulda destroyed them.
As boring as that would be to watch. It would be equally sweet to watch it happen against Bama. Go get your 'ship Dawgs.
Security to the Alabama locker room.
Go Dawgs!
LETS FUCKING GO
It wasn't like he barely stepped on the line, either. He was like a foot and a half out of bounds.
DAWGSSS
Tessitore is calling out Bama for getting depressed. I hope Saban watches this and we get a big rant.
Finally a TD!
NOW WERE COOKIN! UNREAL
[deleted]
Feels like Auburn
Hahaha we're gonna lose 31-0
Dawgs
my dawgs are barkin'.
Great play call
Woof?
Piss off Bama
OhIo StAtE sHoUlD nOt HaVe MaDe ThE cFp
Nick Saban: That stupid jock
CORSO CURSE!
Who set the line? 44 seems high...
Thats a big penalty
rOLl tIdE
shut them out georgia that would be amazing.
BLANKED!
Rip Bama, I welcome our new UGA overlords
oh boy. will there be a fight? Bama looks like they are getting frustrated.
W I L D D A W GILDDAWG
I can just hear the Georgia boners
They're only pissing bana off right... :(
WILDDAWG
Well I was right about a QB sneak/ Zone read
Oh shit whaDUUUUUUPPPPPPPP
Some would say he''s a Hardman to catch 
DAWGS
WILD DAWG
It was their lowest yardage total in a first half until tonight
Delicious play call
LEGGO UGA BROS
DAWGS!!!!!!!
UCF would've made this game more interesting.
TD DAWGS!!! What a play design!
Idk what Georgia says to celebrate, but I imagine its WOOF WOOF
The DAWGS *barking* in the 1st half hahahaha CRINGEEEE
Wilddawgs 
#DAWGS DAWGY DAWG
GO GEDDEM DAWGIESS!!!11
Fuck. Yes. Keep scoring Dawgs
It was clearly late. The player had plenty of time to let up.
You''re crazy if you think that. 
D is doing all it can. 
GEORGIA-BASED TEAM UP DOUBLE DIGITS AT HALFTIME, I REPEAT, GEORGIA-BASED TEAM UP DOUBLE DIGITS AT HALFTIME.
Let's fuckin go! 
Give it to Chubb!
Guys I think Georgia might be good 
HOW! BOUT! DEM! DAWGS!
Never seen a bama team give up so fast. 
Bama and Clemson didn''t deserve to be here?
Shit, I wonder if he''ll just send Pruitt on to Knoxville or settle for ripping his head off and shitting down his neck.
**THE DOWGS**
WHO LET THE DAWGS OUT
No come on now that's just ignorant. The guy saw the QB throwing it and knew he was going to hit the QB after the play was over.Stupidity.
Beautiful play call and execution. 
Great call. Don't even risk that stupid shit in a game like this. It was late and he almost stopped before hitting him. No excuses 
So nonchalant 
Hell yeah
hot fucking dam
Go for 2
I baited your reply hun
*sigh*
And Bama starts to fall apart.
hot dog
Thanks Bama
14 for Alabama has been pissing me off all game. He has been pushing everyone after the whistle all night. 
Tennessee about to be in the coaching search again Jeremy Pruitt about to go missing 
They said "he was close".
Daboll would ruin him
Who would win. The best college football coach ever or one Frommy-boi.
What a fucking idiot 
Bama done lost their minds 
YESSSS!!!! TD GEORGIA!!!
Just gotta keep gashing them
#rundabawl! Let's goooooo
WOOF WOOF WOOF
Hahaha yes IMPLODE Bama. IMPLODE. 
I like how Alabama has all the talents in recruiting yet has a joke of a player at qb
Yo Clemson sucks
DEM DAWGGGSSSS
That happens when you defense is on the field the entire game.
[deleted]
Wooooooooo
Great call!
"he was giving him the business"
that was a nice play call.
idk, but at the very least there would be points
We're a meme.
HATE FEEDS THE DAWG. DAWG H8 ELEPHANT. DAWG WANT TITLE!
BARKBARKBARK
No one knows Nick better than Kirby yo
Who will Saban murder at halftime? 
FUCKING TOUCHDOWN!!!!!!!!
I''m unsettled 
Wiped from memory eh?
What is the point of ESPN even having a streaming service when it's this shitty?
YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This is fun. 
JAWJA Y'ALL PLAY SO PURDY
#W I L D D A W G
Oh my. 
Them Dawgs is hell
Fowler been dying to say “barking in the first half” all game. 
Saban is going to loss his shit. Love to be a fly in that locker room.
Well Nick isn't as angry yet as to throw his headset to the ground.  He's getting soft. 
LETS FUCKING GO
Feels good man. *woof woof*
Busting out fucking a Pop Warner (the coach not the league) single wing play from 1920s for a touchdown.  Simply beautiful.
Its called good defense. Don't watch the NFL if you don't like watching this lol. 
Saban about to take his belt off
Nick Saban is not the same coach anymore
Dirty hit, fuck Thompson
69 yard drive for the dawgs!
I don''t think Jalen Hurts can score two touchdowns unanswered.
Wow Bama sucks^^^^^^^^PlsDontWinBama
GO DAWGS!
Just tuning in whatd i miss oh wow nice
Pretty weak, but he did push
That was a great drive from Georgia
LOL that's game!
I felt like Bama and Clemson both got in mostly on name. Alabama was good this year of course but not clearly as dominant as in the past.
How many commercials is that??
Wonderful play design Bama defense had no idea until it was too late
THE DAWGS ARE OUT
BARK BARK
WHOOOOOOO
Saban is going to go in, murder everyone and create voodoo zombies to play the game.
If he stepped out on his own he can't be the first to touch the ball I believe. Since he was pushed out, he can re-establish himself inbounds and then catch the ball
Bama is missing having Kiffen so bad right now 
If hurts comes in second half it''s a forfeit. 
I''d be frustrated if I was on the Bama defense as well
Bork Bork 
bama who?
Come on that was obvious
I've not been on the Tua train until right now. 
Wild Dawg
Seriously, #4 runs really Hardman. 
FUCK YEAH LETS GO DAWGS!
ITS GREAT TO BE A GEORGIA BULLDOG
Is hell!
Thats where the band sits
Bama fans look so sad and confused.  "I thought this was the part we were supposed to be having fun."
Damn, perhaps Georgia-OU was the real championship.
Hell yeah gimme that sad Nick Saban not sure which voodoo doll to reach for, gimme that video on loop!
RIP ALABAMA DYNASTY 2009-2016
69 yards on that Georgia drive. Aaaayyyeeeeee ;)
You can't do that tho
BAMA UGA UGA UGLY CRYIN
Third try''s a score
Way to UGA!  I am shocked.Bamas gonna make some adjustments though.
Yep Georgia is kicking Alabama''s ass like I thought
I''m done with Hurts. 
Watch for Tua in the 2nd. 
BE HUMBLE. 
CartmanImSoHappy.gif
THEM DAWGS IS HELL, DONT THEY
No, FML.
flair up homeboy
These penalties are going to cost Alabama if they don''t check themselves. 
Hilarious penalty.
Finally, a TD.
LET'S GO DAWGZ
Nick Saban at halftime be like "Bring me the Dagger".
Gut em dawgs
KEEP CHOPPING!!
Thanks for the insight
Alright, that was a phenomenal drive. Perfect really. 
I hate this game 
2nd quarter was all Georgia. 13-0.
Les Miles would stick with Jalen too though
The obvious roughing the passer? Even Saban saw that.
Dude, how was that a bullshit call?
LOL how is ESPN not capable of building a site that can support a big game. I'm constantly stuck on the loading circle and my internet speed is [probably not the problem](https://imgur.com/0YIXUET)
Saban is going to make that guy eat his own brain at halftime Hannibal style
Jalen Hurts needs to be benched
**LETS GO DAWGS! GOLDEN DOMERS ARE WITH YOU TONIGHT!**
I feel the pain. Both of these are our rivals
Yea wasn't even close.
Georgia is playing out of their minds
I''m moving to Alabama in a few week for a job. I''m so depressed
THE DAWGS!!! FUCK BAMA!
Bama doing it to themselves. 
THEM DAWGS IS HELL DON''T THEY
Cutliffe was dumbstruck when that guy roughed the passer
Well, the refresh just showed me how far behind this stream is. Grats Dawgs!
that was kinda schoolyard but it is what it is
**MECOLE! WILD DAWG! MAH GAWD! I'M IN LOVE!***
Don't worry Bama fans I am sure your explosive quarterback will run his way out of the pocket to a win.
Let's go Dawgs 
Nick Saban gonna use his sabanness in the locker room.
WOOOO THEM DAWGS IS HELL
THEM DAWGS IS HELL
Stupid stupid cheap shot.
GOOD DAWGS!
Yes
THEM DAWGS IS HELL!
Can we stop saying we want 'bama now?
#GO DAWGS!
I don''t like having a lead going into halftime...
shit shit shit shit go dawgs
I think Alabama used all their dark magic and voodoo against Clemson in the Sugar Bowl and left none behind to help win the Championship. Damn. 
Hell yes dawgs!  Get it
georgia pls dont go andy reid on us
There few sights as heartwarming as a heartbroken bama fan. 
Nice 
GEORGIA ON MY MIND
Great fucking play call, fuck yeah DAWGS LET'S FUCKING GO
WOOF WOOF
How bout them Dawgs! (bark) (bark)
Uh oh
And here...we...go. 
What if I told you Kirby Smart was the one teaching defense to Nick Saban 
Just don't squib it.
Suck it up Alabama buttercups. You've enjoyed too much success the past decade. You shouldn't even be here.
Oh wow, we actually get to see a TD in this game
I''d be pissed if I was Bama''s D. Their offense is completely shitting the bed and leaving them out to dry. 
Touchdown Georgia Dawgs!
Upset bama fans make me happy.
I know it's early as hell but I don't think bama is coming back.  
People were shitting on the announcers for thinking Bama looked undisciplined in the tunnel too...lmao
Nothing makes me happier than seeing dejected bama fans in the crowd.
"We weren't that good this season anyway" from Bama fans in 3, 2, 1...
FUCK BAMA
Go for 2!
Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb
If he steps out of bounds without being forced, he is ineligible to catch the ball immediately 
13-0 and it feels like 35-0.
Seeing Bama fans watching their team get beat makes me feel like a kid on Christmas again
Nobody should be celebrating the fact that grown men will be even more encouraged to bark at people.
Yeah dawggsssss woo wooo
LETS GO!!!!
Bama very undisciplined
TOUCHDOWN!!!
nice
Oh you're probably  right good call. 
Put Tua in so we at least see some of the future.
nice one Dawgs
RELEASE THE TUA!
BLIMPWORTHY
Jalen and Daboll are screwing us again... feelsbadman 
**TOUCHDOWN VS ALABAMA****TOUCHBACK VS PATRIOTS**
GIMME THAT H8!!! FEED THE DAWG!!!!
95 mothafucka 
Miss Kiffen yet?!?!?
Sad Alabama fans make me smile.
It's all about a couple wrinkles.
*WILDDOG
Lol what kind of terrible team would get shut out in the playoffs.. ha.. ha.....
Go Dawgs!!!
This game pleases me
SPURRRRRIERRRRRR
Apparently playing Mercer doesn't make you prepared to play the best of your own fucking conference 
HOW BOUT THEM DAWGS
32-0 hopefully. 
A Georgia football team dominating a championship game against a dynasty? Zero chance they blow this
Give me all the chaos 
Mental toughness!
WOO dogs!
WILD DAWG TOUCHDOWN
Hardman, I'm hardman
I''d imagine they stick with Fromm, but they also have a commitment from the #1 QB in the country.
Wish we didn''t have to do this, but thank you so much. This works.
Saban bout to go supersaiyan in the locker room
that wasn't an obvious call. it was terrible.
Bama is getting curb stomped and I love every moment of it
Again, fire Daboll
RAW DAWG''D 
YES. AVENGE US FOR THE 2012 BCS CHAMPIONSHIP.
them dawgs is hell 
Fuck it go for 2 they're gassed 
No.
These are some good dawgs
Perfect drive
Dat pretty play design 
I wish
Bama getting fucked on
LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
is alabama gonna be able to do to georgia what georgia did to oklahoma?
Wonder what percentage of that crowd is Georgia fans
When is Georgia playing UCF?
Is everyone pulling for UGA besides Alabama fans?
I am Nick Saban's raging hemorrhoid
Fuck bama
20 minutes of possession in the half bit the defense only surrendered 13 points. Offense better do its part next half. 
Nobody out-Alabamas Alabama? Fine. We will just Georgia them instead. Byeeeeeeee
FUCKING PENALTIES GODDAMMIT BAMA
looked like a hold tbh
Bull Connor in 1953
Low scoring isn't boring, but domination is. If this continues, it will be.
Weooow
what sound does a small dog make?"HECK HECK HECK"
After that pre-game graphic of the assistants trying to pull the Alabama sword out of the stone....can they set up a live prop for that and have Kirby actually do it after the game? 
HOT DAMN!
THEM DOGS IS HELL DON'T THEY
Bah Gawd them hells is dawg aint that
RURURURURU
ROLL DAWGS
Don't change your flair just yet m8
Please Georgia put up 30 on Bama and shut them out. Please. 
Beautifully designed play there
omg UGA is gonna win :(
Game over, fuck college football dude this team is so shit, Jalen is trash, Defense is BEYOND trash right now holy fuck, this is the most pathetic “effort” I''ve seen from a team in the National Chanpionship
LOL we all knew this Bama team was beatable but damn they look awful....end of an era?
Just Jake from state Fromm
RB who thinks he's a QB, injuries, kicker who doesn't know what a goalpost is
BARKIN' IN THE FIRST HALF!
Get em DAWGS!
LETS GO TDDD!!!
GG bama
Saban so mad.
Because he doesn't want big skill guys. He wants game managers.
Bama is getting thoroughly outplayed on offense and defense. They look deficient in every area of play and by far the worst team on the field today. If Fromm placed a few balls a little better earlier this could easily be 21 or 28-0. Bama is gonna need a revolution in the locker room to change the trajectory this game is on. Maybe we see Tua after half? If Bama keeps playing like this I just don't see how this doesn't get really embarrassing for them. 
Inb4 all the 5d checkers memes when bama comes back in the second half
based on the 1st half play, does anyone think bama's offense can put up 14 on georgia's defense without georgia putting up another point?
This pleases me immensely lets go Dawgs.
I''m shaking.
I KNEW IT WILDCAT FOR THE TD. GO DAWGS
*13
That call was dope af
Dyslexics 'bout to start making the 31-0 jokes.
beautiful play call, so happy right now
This game is over. Jalen sucks and he won't be replaced.
That might be game over. I just don't see the fight in Alabama tonight and I don't think Saban can will them to cover that lead. 
Couldn't have been worse
Fuck it, put Tua in there.
End of a dynasty 
TD GEORGIA and therefore TOUCHDOWN AMERICA
GG Georgia
**D A M N**
Don't worry Bama. If Georgia scores the next 18, then you'll not be teased forever about it.  Nope, absolutely not.
Oh, to be a fly on the wall in this Bama locker room at half. 
Oh shiiii
Really? Did you not watch us play Clemson last year? We threw that title away
Probably Jalen
*ARF!!! ARF!!!*
On espnnews and on watchespn
Wow TD
Whens the committee going to learn that Bama doesn't really belong in the CFP off of their name alone? 
Yeah Cutcliffe and Fitzgerald are my favorites on the show, never really listened to either of them but they have a lot of great input.
Second half adjustments. I have seen Bama score quick man. 
YES!YESSSSSSSSSSS!
THEM DAWGS IS HELL DON'T THEY
KRA KA TUA TO THE RESCUE!
That''s an obvious roughing penalty. 
So... A Georgia team is completely dominating their juggernaut opponent at halftime? Interesting.
Not saying I think it will happen but can you imagine the memes if Bama got shut out
What a slick play call
WILD DAWG
Good doggos!
TOUCHDOWN
GAME
They ran them all last week.
Saban pulls off his mask at the end of the game to reveal his true identity — WILL MUSCHAMP
Alabama is scoreless in one half. Wow.
You could see that option play coming a mile away.
The dawgs are barking!
13-0, a new twist on a classic score
That was a beautifully designed play
Nick Saban is gonna blood sacrifice someone during halftime, mark my words...
THE ROSE BOWL WAS THE REAL NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP GAME;)
clutch block by 18 for UGA on that play 
yes
yes
Saban is going to be ripping the paint off the walls in the locker room at halftime *holy shit*
Don't just beat them, HUMILIATE THEM
This Film Room feed is so good.
IS BAMA EVEN GOOD?? WHO DID THEY PLAY THIS YEAR? ^^^/s
Does UGA squib here?!
Rat poison 
yeeeeeee yeeeeeee dawgs
This has been the longest 2 minutes of my life.
How many of the analysists STILL are going to predict bama wins?  more than half im betting.
18 with a nice block on that. 
aSsItAnT cOaCh cUrSe
The faces on Bama fans in the stands will sustain me for the next week.
But seriously, their offense against one of these defenses would've been real interesting.
TDs NO LONGER ILLEGAL
[Bama's first half](https://gfycat.com/PointlessLongIberianchiffchaff)
Idk if I''m more hyped about the game or Kendrick
If the TE hits the first defender that's no gain. Nice blocking.
Basically
Until Jalen transfers or graduates yeah
UCF never wanted to be in the CFP because that would endanger their National Championship hopes.
Hi Fiesta bowl bro! We had a fun game!
Football isn't entertaining when there is this much of a mismatch between offense and defense on both sides. That's true at any level. 
Bake em away toys 
What happens if Saban get blanked in the Natty?
yes
nice
At least now I know OSU could've done better in the playoffs lol since we have an offense too!
Thompson is getting his Charger repoed for that roughing the passer
So exciting!
Roughing the passer? That's a paddlin'Glad Georgia could take advantage of it.
That... looked like holding on the wildcat.Edit: better angle on replay, clean block by 18.
TUA TUA TUA TUA TUA TUA
Great fucking play design
UCF should have been in the playoffs
auburn exists
oh my god they're gonna blow it aren't they
Fuck Kendrick, how can we get a live feed to Saban going ballistic in the locker room?
WHO SHOULD I HATE MORE 
***H8 FEEDS THE DAWGS***
Tua means comeback in Hawaiian 
Bama is ass, my dudes
yep
Georgia you glorious bastards you might just pull this off!
I AM CALLING IT GEORGIA BEATS BAMA 33-0
What is this touchdown they speak of? 
Woof woof woof 
Good game Alabama! You guys are a nice, competitive team, and I have no doubt you guys will be scary good next year
[deleted]
So Georgia blowout?
so if Bama is the NE of CFB does that mean UGA will pull a Falcons later in the game?
Saban has clearly lost it, time to fire him/s
Nice work, DAWGS!
The team that has the greatest coach of the past 10 years?  The same team that has rolled over people with ease.  Just because someone is punching y'all in the mouth is no reason to throw in the towel.
Saban is going to invent some new words at halftime
Cheney is calling a lights out game so far, I'm very impressed
How is the wildcat still a thing? It is going to be a run 99/100 times it makes no sense
Saban has lost control of his Dawgs... Wait that's not right...
Yes
don't they
Whatever the outcome is, I hope this game gets Saban to retire 
Lol Michigan State 
Perfect play call there
NO
Everyone but
Fair enough, can't argue with that logic
Bama staff is getting Sabans pentagram ready in the locker room as we speak
I've never seen a Saban team dominated like this with stakes so high. I'm stunned. 
Fire Saban
Incoming UGA choke in the second half
Yes.
that's why we're all watching, right?
Did someone say 13-0?
Man Ive gotten some great ones on this madden Jesus Pounds is my favourite, but Banks Youboty is pretty great, then you have Tyrone Baadknews. 
yes
Yes.
We miss pro-style QBs more
I miss Tiffin Time
The world is winning right now
Georgia really hasn't played THAT well, but they just keep taking advantage of stupid plays by Alabama.
Don't they!?
If we don't see Tua I'm gonna be furious
#I LOVE COLLEGE FOOTBALL
There are some salty motherfuckers in this thread 
Can I just say its incredibly fulfilling watching Bama get pole fucked like this.
I just don't like the sport, and it's not for a lack of trying.
Maybe if our oline wasn't trash tier 
Goggles: 7 points  Everyone else: 6
Will there be Tua time?
Saban had better have the speech to end all speeches ready.
UCF, would''ve been better on this stage, likely would end as a scoring shootout, but I''ll take that over this SEC joke of a NCG. 
31*
You're goddamned right it is
Saban frustration is porn to me. 
Finally. I''ve been waiting all day to see this black panther sneak peek 
I may be being pessimistic here but I think this is the beginning of the end of the saban era. We will get to the playoffs or championship game and won''t be able to finish. It''s been good y''all. 
I want this to be true, but please wait till it's over.
Get rolled tide
Wasnt ALabamas defense jumping up and down and raging?
“High school quarterback doesn''t know what to do with the ball.” Does he know where he is???
Try the YouTube TV free trial. It's working great for me.
Loving this salty-saban-cam in the lower left of the command center
THE ROSE BOWL WAS THE NATTY
Damn Georgia is playing out of their minds. The carefully calculated plays on offense are impressive. 
THEM DAWGS IS HELL, DON'T THEY
Looks like it's going to be a late night.  The 2nd half will be too interesting to go to bed now.
Them dawgs is hell don''t they
I knew you guys should've been in instead of Bama 
ESPNNews
Jalen hurts looks mentally hurt
What the fuck why is the stadium so empty?
The dawgs barking in the first half??? How stupid can you be? Who writes this crap for them? Do the practice saying it in the mirror, how do they not realize how stupid they sound?
When has that not been the case. 
I'm not pulling for either one if it helps.
This offense. I have zero faith in this offense. Hurts isnt a pocket passer but it seems like Daboll is forcing him to be one. 
What a block by Nauta. Knew to pull off the DE and go to the next level. 
Shoot I thought he was hand it off too
Apparently if you get pushed out the play is still live
She was looking aaaaaarealgood
Somewhere, Kiffin is smiling. 
This is so cathartic
As an Ohio State fan, hell yeah!  Nice TD Dawgs
I do not like the Georgia BulldogsWhen they score, I think to myself, "No"When the other team scores, I think to myself, "Yes"
Indignant Bama fans. Interesting to see.
When ESPN is trashing Hurts every chance they get and ignoring Georgia receivers that CLEARLY step out of bounds, it's pretty clear what this game is set up to be. 
fuck Bama
Like, very smart 
That Georgia defense is screwing you pretty good too. Those guys are savages
Thanks for freezing right before that TD, watchespn.FUCK YOU ESPN
great way to end the half
WILDAWG BABY!
One would hope.
Aayyy
And UCF didnt slam the defensive titains Auburn. I mean hell we scored more than anyone else did all year..... including the two "playoff" teams. I hold this playoff is for second place
I'll never be comfortable in this.. saban usually wins the haltime adjustment game
Who gets the ball first in the 2nd half?
Woof
Sad bama fans are amazing. Is this how everyone else feels about Michigan?
[deleted]
I think so.
I'm pulling some pork if that matters
 I would love to see Tua .. best QB on your roster, Jalen is a RB with a decent arm
Maybe UCF fans as well so they get the Championship claim more legitimized 
Bama, duh.
alabama's offense is keeping the d gassed.this has been a pathetic performance so far.
One that didn't win their conference championship!
Yes
not gator fans, at least not the couple i've seen commenting
If anybody in here thinks the game is over right now they've not seen a single second of the college football
What a fucking play call
My man needs some oxygen CAUSE WE GASSIN HIM UPPPPPP
Fun Fact: SC scored more points on Georgia in the first half with Kurt Roper as OC than Bama has.
Lack of setting the edge gave that to UGA.  Blame the refs if it makes you feel better though.
To be fair, I said the same thing about our team last week. You guys scored 10 points on offense and 14 on defense. We would have won if it wasn''t for the two pick-sixes off of tipped balls. 
Dead inside.
Who would have thought the SEC champion was the best team in the SEC. It''s a shame the conference couldn''t play all the teams against each other and have a championship game to figure this out ahead of time.
at this rate, the game will end 26-0.
Inb4 "Did Bama belong in the playoffs?"
NO STOP IT
SQUIB IT
AWOOOOOOOO
OXYGEN GATE
Id second this a 100 times over
7 more seconds til that
Ok
Well written.
That would be cold blooded.
Rustled Jimmies Saban is the best Saban. 
Please keep this going into the second half Dawgs!
Georgia is so disciplined basically an NFL team
GO DAWGS!!! WOOOO
that fat WR, #94 bit hard there
Yes
They keep plays like that specifically for moments like thisKirby has called this thing masterfully so far. 
Can't expect to win if your offense can't do a goddamn thing.
31-0?
Yep your internet speed is definitely not the problem
I will say for damn sure that Georgia is playing like hell, and if it keeps up as it is now, they damn well deserve the win. These dawgs are rockin it
SHAKE THAT THANG!!!
Turns out the SEC champ is the best team in the conference. Wish we had a game to figure that out earlier...
Pulling for Bama.Live in Atlanta and am surrounded by UGA fans. Cannot stand them.
Where the run is going is the trick
Bama vs Bama vs Georgia.
I think I speak for my fellow B1G boi CFP teams when I say, I'm here for the potential shutout 
They got the ratings they wanted for Clemson v Alabama III, but I'd rather be watching Ohio State or Wisconsin v Georgia right now. 
Head they got some internet out there Californee way
I don't think it was an option 
HOW BOUT THEM DAWGS??
Georgia is about to reign supreme in the SEC over the next 4+ years. 
Dont worry Cutcliffe, I have no doubt Saban will have "serious conversation" in the locker room
HEY GEORGIA DID YOU SCORE RIGHT BEFORE THE HALF???? WHY DONT YOU SQUIB KICK IT NOW HUH?
Because this has happened multiple times or something
You and me both
I'm trying to keep this SFW
Is it Tua time?
What about 13-0?
Yes
Hurts can't doing anything. Im really curious if saban would even consider putting in tua
Are we watching the same game?
MAKE AMERICA GEORGIA AGAIN. 
Not us. Don't really want Bama to win either tho 
Disagree
[removed]
UGA is going to be National Champs and their recruiting classes are only getting stronger. Can we just cancel the next few seasons
I feel very bittersweet at the moment
Should've gone for 2
Why are you the way that you are
Lol 
Fuck Bama, fuck the Huskies, fuck everyone!
But your rival is getting curb stomped so at least you have that
Bama: get your shit together.  Also, Georgia, y'all playing like BEASTS.
Uh...
"Wild Dawg"The name... is "Wildcat," son. It's fine to use the formation, but just recognize.
Eason watching his future at Georgia completely slipping away tonight
Nice play design!
Ohio State might have made this more interesting. 
The falcons would be proud
Lol? Never call a game by it's first half
Try poking them with a stick
Wasn''t a big hit but was absolutely rulebook RTP.
I know the defense has struggled on third down, but a lot of the failures of this game so far rest on the anemic Alabama offense.Hurts has been ass. The offensively line has struggled, too.
Defense is trying their damndest but the fucking offense isnt letting them rest.
This but unironically
I don''t know if Hurts is 19 or 39
All I''m saying is that UCF would''ve had at least the same amount of points as Bama at halftime. 
NCAA 2005 Update: My kicker makes an easy 19 yard field goal as time expires on the first half to put the Gators up 3-0. Should've been 7 points but my running back got stopped on 3rd and goal so I let the clock run down and took the 3 points
Man, this Homers broadcast is actually pretty great.
Fromm has the dick that was promised
2x time of possession UGA to bama.  That's the difference.  We will be totally gassed in the 4th unless we suddenly come up with some O.
Without injury, we won't
Youre going to make a lot of people jelly with numbers like that
The play calling for Georgia has been brilliant.
Right before the halftime thread so no one will see this but I heard Fromm has a big ole girthy daddy dick. Search your heart. You know it to be true.
Oh geez are you telling me a team who got third in their conference shouldn't have went to the playoffs?
shut up SHUT UP **SHUT UP**I..I don't want to think about it.
STFU
It makes perfect sense when you switch the back to some no name right before the snap so the defense can't adjust
Thank you so much!!  The sounds of the game stream is where it's at!
I love how the announcers have slowly stopped slobbering all over Alabama. 
Dude ran like 10 yards and he's suckin the oxygen.
So how many points would UCF hang on Georgia right now? 
Come on Bama. Get shut out. It's fun, I swear.
Ehh not really
your  QB  has to play well man,you can throw on Georgia .they have to do it in the  2nd half.
Last week begs to differ
For Christs sake bench Jalen
69 yard drive? *nice*
Gg no re. Goodnight all
If that causes saban to switch to Tua next year I''ll take it
Woof that''s a great play call 
Barking shook the kick returner
Why you do this? 
It's still only a two-possession game
It's so sad to see the potential with this team and watch such a shitty fucking quarterback just piss it away. I dont care if TUA throws 5 interceptions at least he will go out there and throw it. 
I hate you right now lol
Wait! Does this mean Saban was coaching the SC vs UM game? :o
Just gotta do it in the second half.I was feeling real good about a 13-0 UGA halftime lead until I remembered that 28-3 Atlanta halftime lead about a year ago.
Wisconsin sure didn't 
Ewwwww....
Guys stop saying Georgia will win. Don''t jinx it. Alabama is going to win by 50, obviously
2nd Half: Tua Time
I hope the rose bowl comeback will keep us focused.
It's a meme playcall but it works! 
Underrated comment. 
Georgia, please win 32-0.We believe in you!
Georgia doin gods work 
Nah, man. This the same play calling he did with the Pats. Remember those 20 qb sneaks a game Tom Brady ran?
THEY IS
Really nice! I made another similar comment and have to respond to yours with how fast this thread is going
Jalen Hurts cannot win a national championship. He's not even a game manager, and we have a potential all star on the sidelines.
Kenny Blankenship with the boot
This Alabama team wasn''t beating Baker and the gang.Don''t fuccin @ me
Lmao RIP Bama
Unsubscribe 
Anyone have any links to Bama sports radio? I'd like to listen to some crazy halftime phone calls.
anyone know if migos or future are in attendance at this game?
What''s a drive 
No squib kick to end the half?
Saban is getting out coached tonight. This is chess. Incredible.
I would not want to be in the Alabama locker room this half time. Damn. 
Bama pls make it interesting 
It's a great half for not Alabama. And therefore, the rest of the world. 
In a nutshell 
NOOOOOOO
Fuck bama
1^st thing Kirby's gonna tell 'em once they get to the locker room, I guarantee it... Oklahoma was up *fourteen* at the half
All these comments are gonna enable the Alabama comeback and it scares me
TRUE FRESHMAN DRINK
There is a lot of fucking football left. 
THEM DAWGS IS HELL
TRUE FRESHMAN
Not so fast my friend
It still works. It's how Georgia beat Oklahoma last week. 
The defense expected a handoff to Michele and that''s why the play worked 
When we stop beating the number one team in the country in the first round
Damn Dawgs. #WOOF WOOF
[deleted]
Whenever I see a hot chick on TV they always move their head ever so slightly like they know the exact moment when guys are paying attention to them. Women are like cats with their senses. When I see a hot chick in real life they do the same thing, but with more disgust in their eyes. 
I've actually seen a frankly unsettling amount of War Eagles rooting for us
Yeah
He need oxygen
That's actually pressurized weed drug that's how they win 
Georgia scored more against Bama this half than you did all game long.
Atlanta Falcons = Georgia#Oh boy#
t r u e f r e s h m a n
no
I'm *really* starting to like Georgia.
Still a lot of football to be played is code for> please don''t leave we have more commercials 
*Georgia used stifling defense!***Alabama is confused!!!**
Yeah keep Jalen in for the rest of this game and let him play out the game planBut Jesus fuck we need to start Tua next year 
THEM DAWGS IS HELL DON'T THEY
Alabama
One-yard run and you need oxygen?
Jesus fuck we look so bad
I haven''t seen a more inept Bama team all season long - offense is anemic 
well i didn''t expect Alabama to get embarrassed in the first half 
**THE DAwGS ARE bARKing IN THE FIRst haLF**
Shocked they didn't try and squeeze in another commercial.
13-0 isn't insurmountable, but Georgia is absolutely dominating this game in every facet. Saban needs to make some serious adjustments, primarily on offense. Defense is more tired than anything right now. TOP is extremely lopsided. 
Nauta hasn't done a lot for receiving this year but he's had several key blocks. 
What a GORGEOUS variation of the Wild Dawg. Bama's D had no idea where the ball was going
I believe.
yes say yes 
Unrelated but I hate that they call it the wilddog
Why do i feel like Bama is still gonna win...
0
yup
End of an era ? Lol we have been in all 4 playoffs and 3 championships. Y'all look great now but there is a whole half to play.
Yeah those two are killing it. Gundy isn't talking much, but when he does its really insightful i find.
Isnt that the same bs that was said for the knights against auburn...... 
JAKE FROMM IS A TRUE FRESHMANDRINK
Jalen Hurts not even sweating. 
Read Option is a fucking hard play to defend. It's even harder when both guys run 4.3-4.4s
I think I'm happy Bama made it to the championship now...
Sudden thought: If Alabama loses this, they didn't win their division, didn't win their conference, didn't win the National Championship?? Fire Saban!
Since LSU in 2016
Our defense is very well rested.
Yes, Clemson was legit a good game. But the vaaaast majority of these Bama championship games are soooo boring. Husband is back awake but is in and out. 
Subscribe
Yeah they usually do pull some shit out of the ass and become competitive in the second half.
Lol
Straight Iron Bowl repeat. Kirk Herbstreet said it perfectly about Hurts. The second he senses pressure he just freaks and scrambles.
You're just hurt, no need to be salty. We showed against Clemson we should be here. Talk about Ohio State being in the playoffs last year and getting 0 points. THAT is not deserving to be there
Defense is tired and Jalen playing like ass
See Alabama, this is what happens when you play in an all SEC natty.:((((((((((((
69
The fucking dream
subscribe 
Yes.
Protesting hard! But minimum fomo with a score like this :D
Can we all agree that the real story of this game is how terrible Jalen has been?
The tight end threw a great block to make that TD happen.
Beat Bama like a drum!
nice
After watching the rose bowl offense from Oklahoma I think you're more than 1 player and 1 play caller from having offensive success. Hmm... maybe not. 9 left in the third and an impressive drive. 
I wish, but don't expect Jalen to come out without being injured.
How many passes have we completed over 5 yards?
Jake Fromm is wicked smaht
Is Jake Fromm a true freshman?
Wow, Georgia kno de way
Yes please
31-0
Gotta get just alittle high
I FUCKING HOPE SO
But man he''s not the one winning the games. It''s everyone else carrying him. He''s good on his feet but he can''t open his damn eyes
I so badly want a Kiffin “miss me yet” shitpost tweet
Fromm is a redshirt freshman right
Wait what year is Jake fromm again
tHE SeC SuCkS tHiS YeAr
TUA TUA TUA 
Herbie wouldn't shut up about it and the flipped back to it eventually
Down with the SEC! Slow players; overpaid coaches!
More than 0
Gus, my dude.
I think it's Tua time.
Saban is going to murder someone
Ballgame
37
0 Their defense is insanely on point today.
You wanna throw down?!
Saban might literally kill someone at half
Wait Fromm is a freshman? Are we sure?
When was the last time Bama was down by double digits at half time? 
What year of eligibility is Fromm? Can''t tell
Our DBs have been shit for years, but dumb plays aren't our style. We are third sting in some places , but we should be filling mistakes better. 
That's the band section
Bama
Fromms going nfl he aint graduating 
He looks like a 39 year old Jaden Smith 
Sorry for my bad English Where when you were when Jalen hurts died I there was, go dawgs 
FUCK YOU BAMA! NO ONE LIKES YOU
Well said
DAWGS
*incoming botched squib kick*
<3
We played Georgia better than Alabama did in the first half. That makes us better than Bama, right?No? Okay.
Vanderbilt scored more on Georgia, lol
Bama
Hook route, curl route, scramble, out route, stretch play, repeat.
T R U E F R E S H M A N
Did you guys know that Jake Fromm is a TRUE freshman? 
OUs Defense is Trash...
I mean, if UGA wins you have to stick with the National Championship QB (or even if they lose for that matter) right?? Don''t understand these 5* recruits that go to a school with a young starter....Looking at YOU Tua Tagovailoa!
YOU WATCH YOUR MOUTH 
Make it 31-0
Rat poison
DAWGS
The refusal to take out Jalen is going to lose this game. 
Can''t fault the bama defense this half. This is on jalen hurts. 
Kirby did last week though. 
T R U E F R E S H M A N
Fromm is unbelievable for a true freshman
This feels nice. 
Last
Our offense is ass, my dude. Our defense can''t save us two games in a row
Fair enough. I'm fine with this after the barn burner last week though. 
Does Saban make it to the  3rd quarter or do they immediately fire him and bring in Dabo?
Only time Bama will be in victory formation tonight lmak
We actually won our first playoff game. 
If receiver steps out on his own he then just made himself an ineligible receiver. If he is pushed out he is still considered eligible. 
ROOF ROOF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
If this game keeps going like this, your 2017 Alabama football team will be champions of nothing.
Did I make it? 
So many jitters.
Georgia has amazing playcalling
Can I get a Woof Woof!?
Sorry for my bad English Where when you were when Jalen hurts died I there was, go dawgs 
I wasn't sure if I was going to watch most of this game, but Alabama is losing so I am happy with my choice
Shutout in the first half fuck yea
Last year vs Clemson was way worse imo.
These commentators are sucking Jake Fromm off so much..chill bruh
Georgia always had the talent to be in the championship game once or twice a decade.
Amazing first half for the Dawgs!
Bama didn't even win their Division. WTF are they even doing in this game?
Much like our playoff game at halftime :(
This seems familiar 
Georgia just needs to not be stupid and switch to pounding the ball after half and giving Bama a chance to get back in it. 
Georgia is currently winning.
The apprentice has become the master?
::blink::
Hey Georgia fans remember last time a team you liked was dominating a championship game? ^^plz
Yes.
That was the last college game I watched before I went overseas.  I drank a lot in Ireland before I went to Iraq.
I think 31-0 would be better because it would erase what happened to you
My heart hurts
Could only hope my dude. This is painful to watch right now. 
Guess they shouldn't have lost to OU and Iowa(!) then.
LOL okay
Georgia should squib it
GUYS! You need to remember that jake Fromm is a TRUE FRESHMAN.A TRUE FRESHMAN.
So the OU Georgia game was the real natty
When it's Georgia, it's a wild dawg
We just see tua Tagovailoa  come in
Our program is toast. 
Bullcat!
He''d have to be on the field long enough to work up a sweat. 
If I won the national championship as a freshman I would definitely get arrested that night
Alabama's substitution penalty might have given Georgia this touchdown since they might have gone for a field goal to end the half.
FUCK BAMA
P00p
WOOT WOOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Nah we got hitters coming too.
Not much time on the field.
**H8 H8 H8 H8 H8 H8 H8 H8 H8 H8 H8 H8 H8 H8 H8**

That was a lot of build up to the Kendrick Concert
the dawgs are shitting on the elephant guys
Hurts dreads look hurt
False freshman 
Apparently not playing for your conference championship allows you to slide into the playoffs too. You guys got jobbed by the committee
T R U E F R E S H M A NRUEFRESHMAN
It's Bama.  Saban will make halftime adjustments and come back.  I guarantee it.
UCF would've at least scored points in the first half. Now I kind of wish they made the playoffs.

Are you forgetting we put up 28 on them on the same field you did? You seem to be forgetting that 
Wow,  Alabama looks so flat. 
ok, kendrick time

They wouldn''t have beaten Clemson.
Probably when ole miss came to town 
Big if true

Hurts is the problem. Same thing last year. Just terrible decision making and absolutely no awareness.
Who cares, Bama is getting crushed.
Good first half

Take a shot every time someone mentions Fromm is a freshman.
Why are all those seats empty

Nah they beat the number 1 team in the country easily
UCF isn''t gonna win the Coaches and AP poll?
At least they finally cut it out with the commercials

Is ESPN Film Room going to watch the Kendrick Concert?
Time for the unnecessarily long halftime show.
TRUE freshman 
Announcers said 70
R A TP O I S O N 
Fromm>Hurts from the first half
Georgia may become the new Bama but for now let''s go Dawgs.
I'm just here to listen to the announcers say DAWWWGS
you're kidding, right? 
Our offensive play has disappointed me so much this year. 
Bama message board says “Another Wasted Season.” http://twitter.com/KegsnEggs/status/950560603227262977
It's games like this when I wish college football still had ties.  A tie would be hilarious
Clemson didn't belong either. 
Then Dawgs is hell don''t they
the tight end didn't even block the first guy, he puts a fucking move on him and blocks the second guy.  he blocked 2 dudes on that play and sprung it.  
Terribly boring game
Fromm got a completion, so let's pretend that receivers didn't step a foot out of bounds. 
Lock
Bama done ...
Why does Hurts think that Predator haircut looks good?
U make a compelling argument
pretty sure they are, saw on twitter
They really seem to have a lack of consistency. You know Clemson is asking where the hell this team was when they plaied them last week
[deleted]
I want Saban's head to explode
I think probably around 14-21. Georgia would have 30+ easily on UCF right now.
Hey bama maybe try recruiting a fookin QB
BURN ALL THE RED!
Congrats UGA so far, but I''ve seen a good lead blown in my life. Fuck me.
28-3
I'm fine with that. 
I don't know man I wish they made it more obvious 
I wish UGA and Bama played every year. A Kirby-Saban rivalry would be so dope. 
Bama better be careful. A loss today could make the CFP committee pause for a few seconds before giving them a 2019 championship slot.
I doubt it happens since they would need a 2 but it''d be funny af if Georgia won 21-0LSU has been avenged 
Holy hell... its almost 10pm and only halftime..
2008 vs Tulane. 
:D
Well, they beat Clemson. So, there's that. 
SHOULDVE BEEN GEORGIA UCF
This might be a dumb question, but can players suck on oxygen in the locker room?
Maybe UGA doesn't come back in the second half, amirite?
I actually just made fun of the Patriots and the bias they receive.
So is there going to be some shitty pop singer halftime show, or they going to let the bands do their thing?
Saban's contract with satan is ded
Kendrick concert time
I would give my right nut for them to get shut out.
Angry Saban is funny Saban.
Incoming sarcastic Kiffin tweet 
Sabans voice sounds unusual

Fromm's a true freshman that turns 20 this year, though.

It's Hurts.He can't throw.
SABAN IS SEETHING WITH ANGER LOL

Welcome to my Browns
Why would Dabo want to go coach at that dumpster fire? 
I do hate Gus 
take that knee
Is this a fantasy?
Great son?
Drink everytime they say "true freshman"
Insane that at the very least we have two more years of Fromm. Could go down as one of the all time college greats. 
it's coming
SABAN SHOOK
DIdnt see that coming 
Would not want to be in that locker room at halftime
quality loss, automatic playoff spot next year
:(
Kirk cares way too much about players being true freshmen.
It took nearly two hours for two quarters, and we still have halftime then two more quartersOh boy...
Pretty sure being Clemson cemented that.
You don''t get to say that.
I think we could, too.  Even with our previous playoff performance as the baseline.
Sabanlooks pissed. Like really pissed
I am sure there are no nervous Georgia fans right now. You got this, right?
Absolutely mind blowing that Jalen Hurts is the best Alabama can do. He is so fucking awful. 
Can we just call the game now?
If Georgia wins can we all consider the Rose Bowl as the championship game? It was too good to not be the championship game.
Hey guys, did you know Jake Fromm is a true freshman?
Bama losing? Beautiful 
Last
physicality?
haha 
This just in u/Blarg1889 has alcohol poisoning.
Jeremy Pruitt looking to fuck this game over 
We made it to 10k!
I mean, Alabama has the stigma of being the evil empire who got into the CFP without winning their conference, so both the little guys and big guys hate them 
Hate Georgia more. We're all used to Bama winning titles. If Georgia wins, a bunch of Georgia "fans" are going to come out of the woodwork and be insufferable. Also, what kind of human being barks at another person
He's a true freshman 
I actually agree. I think It'd have been a shootout but it's better than this dogshit.
The angrier Saban is, the more he sounds like Kermit the frog
fake knee, roll out chuck it deep
Sorting by *live* is pretty crazy.
To the halftime thread!
I'm hoping for Georgia to win 38-0, no reason for that though...
Saban really doesn''t know where to look in interviews 
>live on West Coast and had game recorded>get home at 5:45 PM, half an hour into when the game started>fast forward through the commercials>get caught up right as halftime hits, an hour and 40 minutes of recording in about an hourCollege football has just as many stoppages as the NFL, not sure why you guys complain about this aspect of the NFL.
Fake spike 4 verts?
Hey, I heard a rumor that Jake Fromm is a true freshman. Any truth to that?
30 down, 30 to go. 
Mofo breathing oxygen when playing at sea level 
:(
Another caption: "I paid $2000 for this?"
Because it still could be a sweep right, a power right, a trap or dive, counter left, or pass, all of which have to be defended differently
I mean minus the two best teams in the country it kinda did? lol
But these are the best of college football, paaaawllll
Billy Bob Thornton would pay a great Saban
Should have been an OU-UGA rematch.
I like this timeline
Yeah but that was again...oh. Nvm. 
Saban.  Is.  Pissed.
Saban sounds like he about to cry
My t-shirt UGA fan in-laws are 30 minutes away from being insufferably obnoxious for the next year.
IS THIS A FANTASY
In all honesty, I think Georgia would destroy you guys. They were able to destroy Auburn in the same stadium for the SEC championship, even though Auburn was able to destroy them in Jordan Hare a few weeks earlier
out back with cheerleaders
Georgia should brand 13-0 on the side of an elephant if win and no one scores again this game
Saban looks pissed lol
Clemson was the weakest 1 I've seen in over a decade. 
RIP to that locker room. 
Man
In theory coaches should go for 2 a lot more.
God Maria Taylor is so sexy
Halftime adjustments. Let's see what errbody does
Stop talking to the coaches. Kendrick has some stuff to say. 
Overreactions only here
Cant blow a 28-3 lead if you dont have 1.
Obv. to piss everyone off.
Saban's got that vein in his forehead rocking. Those players are in for some shit.
This is a dark timeline
Can Jalen Hurts donut bring them back next half? tune back in in half an hour and find out.
KENDRICK TIME
You mean the sacrifices will intensify.

Pretty boring first half. SEC football though
We to have a qb competition this summer.
*THEM DAWGS IS HELL DONT THEY
Obviously.
YOU HAVE 95 YARDS OF OFFENSE! GET FUCKING JALEN OUT AND FUCKING BRIAN DABOLL PLAY CALL BETTER PLEASE!
This games all on hurts. If alabama had an adequate qb they''d be winning easily.
Who
Why I''m watching the Coaches film room. They''ve had like 3 commercials total
 He's gotten worse.   I dont know what happened to him.  His first start he had more composure and touch than he has now...
Gonna kill someone in the locker room 
The one the cubs won. They deserve the recognition

Fuck this. I'm going to /r/RollTide where people will feel my pain
Saban about to cry?
too early for that, but if they don't change something up, they're going to get their ass kicked. They're getting outplayed pretty thoroughly on both sides of the ball. 
Absolutely, but there have been more drops than bad passes. 
NICK THE DICK SABAN

How much money would you have to get to name your first son Kirby?
Did you look in the mirror?!?!**B****O****O****M**
Saban... brutally honest halftime interview. 
Saban better kick some ass in the locker room.
Georgia looking great.
It is really hard not to yell IU SUCKS every time I hear the crowd noise increase before a kickoff
Sure but they have the least creative offense in the world
I agree Ohio State didn't deserve to be in the playoff.

I'm already squared up 
Saban''s eyes as red as his shirt
Hey herbie. Is Fromm a true fucking freshman? You''ve only said it seventeen times this half 
#K-DOT UNIVERSITY 
Fromm is a freshman.... I've never seen such dominance by a freshman at this stage. 
Cry havoc and let slip the DAWGS of war!!!  Seriously though... Why so much weird barking?
13-0 at the half?  UGA''s doomed.
Wut?
Just think .. RichRod could have been steaming mad on the Bama sideline right now.
too soon
Our offense is garbage. That isn''t saying much 
All of them. 
Oh the last time being against Tulane in '08? I'm watching at a loud-ish party and can't really hear.
Fromm has been lights out so far
You could but this still looks like a game of field goals. A TD and two FGs only tie now, not win.
Physicality. Composure. KeepThe main thing the main thing. 
The most exciting thing about this game so far will Probably be the K.Dot performance 
This John Denver looking mother fucker is gonna dethrone Saban.
I think Nick Saban is upset. 
Jake Fromm is beasting out there
I love Kirbys video games 
I need to see the Georgia fan living next to Auburn fans.
I am loving this
Good ol'' Hot Rod Blankenship.
Multiple titles in coming 
He may have a fatal heart attack during halftime...
He said "he came close to stepping out of bounds"
Nick Saban sounding like Tom Brokaw
Saban looked like he was about to cry
After all these years of dominance, Alabama deserves a humbling beatdownBut why did it have to be Georgia to deliver it?
Must be tough seeing decent QB play. 
You are Ohio State of the past few years. Killer defense that is held back by the awful QB. 
Saban won't be so nice in the locker room. 
From the several years I spent in Georgia, I can say without a doubt that if they hold on to win the Natty that whole State is going to lose its damn mind.  
Bang Edit: fucking hell that was close

[deleted]
FOOTBALL!!
Ballsy to run it out, but I agree that the team needs to show some aggression now
THIS IS ITONE MORE HALF OF CFB
LMAO y''all should have heard Tammy call in to Finebaum
Okay Aaron what have you got to say 
Hey 
poo poo
Push me to the edge 
HIRE BUTCH JONES ARIZONA 
The main ESPN stream sucks. But try the hometown radio feed. Same broadcast, less people streaming it, plus hometown radio broadcasters instead of ESPN announcers!Other option I like is the sky cam or the sounds of the game stream. Sounds of the game is great cuz it''s the same video feed of the main stream, but all you hear is the crowd, the bands, and the PA announcer!
We ready 
#GO DAWGS
SIC'EM DOGS!
And we are back to football and all is right in the world
Hello
FUCKING TUAAAAA
Shut them out, Dawgs!
Extra long halftime may help Bama's defense a little. More time to recover.
Me too thanks
damn mods are slipping I was about to riot 
Aight fam, I'm breaking out the cheerwine early to will the tide into playing.
ELI5: Why is this game on a Monday and not Saturday?
Hurts to the bench?
TUA TIME!
LET'S GO DEFENSE!!!
Wonder if Hurts comes back out
Oh shit he's in. Oh boy.
We are all bulldogs on this blessed day
Make bama cry!!
I'm going to need this game to finish 21-0 for ultimate schadenfreude. 
Wow Tua is actually playing?
Mods is slippin
Bold strategy Cotton
Hi buddy
2016 Pitt Beats Clemson Bama Doesn't2017 Pitt ends their season over the team ranked #2 Bama doesn't.Pitt > Bama confirmed?
Would 21-0 or 31-0 be the better meme?
o shit Hurts benched
Tua in the game?
looks like i might $50 richer tonight
4-eyes kicker is my fav thing rn <3
uh oh Tuaaaa timeeee
Great performance. Now finish this fight Dawgs!
The game has already gotten to the point where they need Tua.
They put in Tua.....
go pups
NICK SABAN DID IT 
Oh shit, Hurts benched.Hurts, don't it?
Lets go Dawgs!
Tua time
Bring it home
At this rate, Kendrick Lamar is going to score more than Alabama or Georgia. 
here we go
BIG KAHUNA
TUA! Now I'm a Bama fan
So did Tagovailoa learn to speak English at halftime?
All the Alabama players walking out of the locker room about 8" shorter.
Tua's in
Panic mode for Alabama.
There's been a Tua sighting. 
Jame-o
TUA!!!
I''m screamin''
OH SHIT TUAS IN
Why take hurts out if you're going to run? 
Mods sleepinng
Gucci gang 
OH MY GOSH! THEY ACTUALLY DID IT!
Pulled Hurts?  Shhhhhhhhiiitttttt
**TUA IS FUCKING IN THE GAME MY DUDES!**
TUA has awoken!
Beer
TUA. ITS ALL YOU BOY. 
Go DAWGS 
Bama super nervous. 
Alright Bama you got Tua 
NFL would eat these ratings for breakfast
NFL playoffs 
thanks
Holy shit they put in Tua
3rd quarter. Where my commercials at? 
[Get the Joker, a real rapper next time](https://youtu.be/KDrJ90MlYhU)
Whew thank god here''s the 3Q thread
TUA TIME 
They really benched their starting QB
TUA TIME!
Georgia please no turnovers
Let''s do this 
Second string qb??
Wow, pulling Hurts?
Tua time! Saban is on reddit and taking our advice 
They announced NCAA 18 if you didn''t watch the half-time show (Guys send this to the top so we can fuck with people)
Aaron Murray trying to be a commentator 
I'm weirdly zen right now. If we can improve our third down defense stats (even if they just return to the mean) then I think the rest of our game doesn't look too bad. Comeback is not that hard to believe in.
This is very ballsy. 
What the hell Saban actually put him in
So is Hurts benched or injured?
Freshman v freshman I like it
Bring out the Flyin' Hawaiian 
TUA TIME 
Go Dawgs!!!
TUA TIME
Wow they actually put him in. Well a Hawaii QB balled in the second half out a week ago on the same field, so maybe we'll see it again
Here for the NaCl
Georgia has been clamping on D 
Ya FUCK YOU WAZZU
Where the FUCK is Hurts
Hurts' last name couldnt be more inwardly accurate
A Hawaiian QB playing for Alabama? I've seen it all now.  
Hi, me again
That is a bold move Nick 
Tua time
Bama is done
Never forget Arsenal lost 4-2 to Nottingham Forest in the 3rd round of the FA Cup
Ah, the Ol Brian Kelly strategy
NFL playoffs
does tua even know english /s
Something was off with the sound
Hmmmm...
Damn I feel bad for Hurts
Yes come on Hawai'ian guy!
Psshhh
TUA GANGGG
Holy crap I didnt think they would actually make the switch 
Fromm's playing well but really this has to be one of the best teams he's faced in the last couple years.
I GET IT
Where is Jalen?
Tua!!
Alright you wanglords, let's do this!
I don't care about the outcome. TUA IS FINALLY IN THE GAME!
The NFL playoffs are on Saturday.
Who did Saban sacrifice at halftime for player encouragement?
Oh shit! TUA
Told yall 
big time defense please
Oh no they put a real passer in the game kinda nervous 
They actually pulled hurts lmaoooo
Damn they benched Hurts lmaoo
Oh my god wow
Saban the ultimate gambler holy shit
oh boy I just can't wait to see how many souls Saban used up at halftime for his dark arts ritualEDIT: Looks like Hurts was one of them. RIP
Things I learned from the halftime thread:Kendrick is overrated. Everything in planet earth is being lip synced.Black Panther is going to be trash. 
HOLY SHIT THEY DID IT
The Kendrick performance was solid.
HOLY FUCKING TUA?!
Hawaii 5-0
here's to hoping for less commercials!
[deleted]
Come on mods :(
Shitty
TUA?!
WOW putting in a true freshman to save the NC in the 2H. This is nuts.
Where the hell was the Black Panther preview? Am I so drunk I missed it on my TV screen? 
Bad as hurts is it's bold as fuck to pull your starter for a true freshman who's never made a start
Thanks for fucking locking the halftime thread and no link, mods :/
I typed out a LONG ASS comment to get “this thread is locked.” Thanks guys.
Saban went in at halftime and said “let''s try this true freshman thing”
This is an excellent move 
ugh, can we get Hurts back? I've seen this new QB play and he's Tua scary
Who the hell is that QB
ESPN SkyCam in coaches room is AWESOME
Gucci Gang
Freshman QB vs freshman QB 
Wow, Jaylen benched.
TUA TIME
QB controversy 
Down to 3 Coronas for the entire 2nd half... Pray4me
Hot take: I don''t like jalen hurts
[removed]
TUA TIMET UA
It's ok. I found religion during the half and am now focused on the more important things in life, like riding in my truck. 
Zac Brown and a local gospel choir doing the anthem and then Kendrick Lamar at halftime? I think they made some good choices for the music this year.
Why is the score not posted? In the title/main body?
Why is there a new Alabama QB?
This feels like a mistake. 
Bama won't go away quietly
please put eason at tight end
I think it's safe to say Hurt's won't play again at Bama
Damn Saban pulled hurts holy shit
Wow, I can't believe Saban actually pulled Hurts in the championship game lmfao 
Why does Hawaii seem to produce so many star players 
Well this sucks
Holy shit, they actually put the true freshman in.
Because the biggest college football game still doesn't want to compete with any NFL playoff game.
Benched
Putting in a cold QB in a championship game is dumb as fuck.
WHAT THE FUCK
Everybody Hurts sometime
Was Hurts bad in the first half? Wtf benching the starter
They put tua in lul
Yeah that surprises me 
Benched 
Holy shit they benched Jalen
I think I'm hung over already
T U AUA
As much as I want Bama to go down in flames and get shutout, I'm excited to see Tua play.
o shit backup in
When they interviewed Landon on the sideline I was thinking that's a stupid question there's no way they pull him. I was wrong. 
The replaced hurts. The madmen. 
From /r/nfl why does /r/cfb split up the quarters? too many comments?
Tua is in... what about that language barrier tho...
Getting benched in the championship?!That's gotta Hurt
So they put in their passing QB and immediately had a QB Keeper...?
Hurts don''t it
The only thing that possible excites me about comic book movies/TV is that they got the AT&T girl to play Squirrel Girl.
Saban what is you doin
Probably because nfl playoffs were then. Idk
Water, have to be at work at 6am. 
Left handed qb? This should go well 
Think it could be because he's lefty??
They actually put him in
Or is it panic?
Question: Why is David Cutliffe wearing a big ol championship ring with a Duke "D" on his right hand? He hasn't won any championships at Duke at all. He doesn't help coach the basketball team does he?
#TuaTime 
GREAT start for the Georgia D
Shit a left handed true freshman QB
Couldn''t find the damn thread 
Fuckin Bama, their 2nd string guy is the number one dual threat.
On the sideline where he belongs
Called Tua coming in. Didn''t think it would be this soon though..
This is the difference between saban and urban.
Woah they pulled hurts? 
*pokes Tua into throwing an interception*
Hurts is benched. Wow!
Let's goooooo
wowwww
Haha good one 
Bah gawd they did it! They actually put TUA in!
Holy shit they actually took out Jalen Hurts, I can''t believe it.
Roquan in a monster
They really put Tua in!
Fingers crossed that Smart can out-adjust Saban.  
You guys do just realize he''s only putting Tua in as a scapegoat for if they lose right?
 SACK
Yea. The football is on between commercials
I called it!
I feel so bad for Jalen, benched in the biggest game of his life, and for someone seemingly worse
Is the Bots man
Because the last set of games was on New year's day, which was a Monday, and there's probably some rule about it having to be a whole week between games?
Holy shit they actually did it!
Never run the kickoff out. Coaches need to tell their players that. 25 is  good field position compared to the 17
ICE UP SON 
They really benched Jalen wtf
This hurts the Bama
ROQUAN SMITH!!!!
Well.....Alabama fans, here's your wish: freshman Tua against freshman Fromm.
Tua goes down
Good god these game thread comments have been shit so far. /r/CFB  has officially gotten too big
Makes me think of Teuvo Teravinen.
Yeah he was
I think currently benched 
Over/under 2 drives before Hurts is back in
My god, Georgia may actually do it 
Blouses 
LETS GO DAWGS
Ro-Ro! You beautiful beautiful boy!
Glad we both made it 
New QB, same as the old QB.
300 comments in 1 minute lol
When was the last time Bama was shut out at half? 
QUAAAAAN
Don't matter what QB you put in if the line don't hold up.
Can someone explain why Tua is in over Hurts and why college teams are condensing their kickoff coverage formation pre kick?
Damn so conflicted. Really dislike Bama but my boy Tua :/
damn i want my bears to get roquan 
Damn, Uncle Saban is cut-throat with his QB's
Anyone want to donate to a Gofundme for the cancer that the halftime show gave us all?  That was shite.    And I like rap, but that is terrible.  
Man you gotta feel like shit RN if you're Hurts.
Roquan on him
So as not to go head to head with the NFL playoffs 
Smith!!
YEEEEESSSSSSS!!!!!!!
That was short lived
Hat was his first series. Let''s settle
Jalen Hurts definitely smiled at that
WOOOO SIT DOWN TUA!
How are we so bad?
So Hurts is out?
Well that went well for Tua
Herbie is about to say Tua's whole name so many times just to prove he can. 
3rd down, let's go!
Benched in the championship... damn
Oof that's gotta Hurt
I hope he isn't hindered by the language barrier.
Sackkk
Hot DAMN y'all!!
If Bama wins this with their backup quarterback 
Bama changed QB's?  lol
yeah Tua can't solve everything.
Hurts.
Hurts hasn't been good at all but I feel like it's a little too late to put a freshman in
RUQUAN BABY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Ahhhhh uhhh Rooooooooquaaaaan
I didn't pay attention to the first half, did Jalen Hurts get hurt or play like shit? 
Where were you when Jalen was kill?
omg I came with Tua being such shit
Holy shit tht kicker is the biggest nerd I''ve ever seen in a football uniform.  Good for him.
Pulled jalen? I'd be pissed if I was him
So Hurts college career could be done if Tua plays well
Jalen Hurt's and his phones background has been benched 
Hurts apparently 
Replacing Hurts? That's a bold move, Saban. 
Benching Hurts?BOLD MOVE BAMA
This offense can't help the defense. 
SPOILERS: ALL BAMA QBs ARE BAD
Saban was making sacrifices to the devil in the locker room during halftime. Expect some crazy shit in the next half.
Just tuned in. Is Hurts ... hurt?
Roquan!
Get your halftime joke out of the 3rd quarter thread.
Only QB''s it seems. 
TUUUUUUUUUA
E'erbody cheering for Tua but then he gets sacked.I don't think it was the other QB's fault necessarily yall
Hey so, was that concert actually on the field? Can the clear the stage that quickly and without damaging the field?
Hurts apparently.
U seem fun
the halftime thread lasted longer than any of the quarter threads so far
Not the ideal time for a QB competition. This isn't good. 
Bama is done.Congrats Georgia. Fuck you.
JALEN HURTS TO THE PIT OF MISERY 
Welp, that didn't go any better.
Tua Time status: Still on hold.
honestly saber should be fired after this game when bama lose
He was.
Uh....
Saban making the move, wow.
Didn't look much different than Hurts.
NICE SACK!
Game
Wow, did he really bench Hurts?! :O 
Bench your guy who got you here? Fucking stupid. 
Under
HOLY SHIT THEY PULLED JALEN
[deleted]
WOOT WOOT!
Roquan!
Damn he wasn''t going anywhere 
Aaaaaaand this is where Bama looses
IS A SYRUP SANDWICH JUST BREAD AND SYRUP? I don''t understand. I need an answer. 
What they put in TUA? WHAT
1
Hi, I'm Roquan Smith. Nice to meet you!
Oh shit Saban
They really benched Hurts? Wow. Hmmm, not sure how I feel about that one 
That''s a fucking car accident of a name. Let''s see if this kid can get something going
This is a thing of beauty.  It hurts a bit to say it.  But it is.
This UGA defense has been crazy and i was not expecting that
saban that madman
Last game of the year Brent, can't hold anything back
Issa pimp ring.
Holy fucking shit that is so disrespectful to Hurts
Missed the first half. Why isn't Jalen Hurtz in for Bama?
Good call bringing pressure against fresh meat
Oh shit
they're gonna go back to jalen next drive i feel like
I'm not sure what I want to do right now. I fell asleep at 2 AM EST today, got up at 6 AM, and am really tired. Do I stay up and watch this game which has been kinda boring or do I catch up on sleep?
Jalen Hurts would have run that 3rd down in for a touchdown, bench Tua - Bama fans, probably
Is there a third string QB?
Benching Hurts was dumb, he''d have gotten a first down there.
That's gotta *hurt* for Jalen to see Tua Tagovailoa on the field 
RIP in piece
Can anyone explain their hatred for that halftime performance (bc I sure saw a lot)? Like, what do you like and in what way did that not measure up? Genuinely asking 
It would be the ultimate Georgia sports narrative if Tua comes in and wins this game. 
Tua Hurt's Pain doesn't matter. Bulldog defense
Well that sure seemed to work for Bama
GET SACKED
I''m sorry, I just can''t get into this game… (tho it is nice watching Bama struggle)
This is probably a bad idea...Can't make adjustments with Hurts?
Huh...no hurts? Thats....interesting
We're in trouble
So you are the 3rd one?
ice cold move by Saban
The Georgia defense is good. Saban should stick with the experienced QB.Edit: I am an idiot. All hail Tua.
Well, he at least completed a pass and didn''t run to the sideline. So that''s something I guess 
Bold move Cotton. We'll have to see if that pays off for them 
i feel for hurts. i think saban will regret that move.
Maybe blaming hurts wasn't the right move. 
Dawgs, wow.
34 is getting sacrificed to Saban
Holy shit how many times do you see a QB change in a national championship game?
Ratings. More casual fans likely to tune in on a Monday as opposed to being out and doing stuff on a Saturday.Although having it on ESPN kind of counters that.
Bama may have just fucked themselves
Tua isnt going to make a difference if the o-line play doesn't improve
Ravioli ravioli give me the tagovailoa
Jalen would've evaded that. 
imagine being benched in the national championship game  then ur replacement gets wrecked first play
Lol Smith is playing his way top 15/10, game over if they score here
>LITERALLY, UNIRONICALLY, BENCHING YOUR TWO YEAR STARTING QB AT HALFTIME OF THE NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP GAME>THE CITY OF COLLEGE FOOTBALL>THE CITY OF TUSCALOOSERNEVERTALKSHITABOUTTHENFLEVERAFUCKINGGAIN
3 and out
Looking forward to Georgia making Alabama look silly some more.
Bama is over. 
Why wasn't hurts in?
HOLY SHIT TUA IS IN.
Tua quarterbacks for Alabama!
Can't believe Saban would sit his starter who he stuck by all year after a bad half
Second verse same as the first 
*"I've seen 22-year old drunk sorority girls who lip sync to Kendrick Lamar better than Kendrick Lamar lip syncs to Kendrick Lamar."* lol
Way to throw Hurts under the bus Saban. That just lost you the game.
This may be the dumbest thing Saban has done.
Sacked like an incompetent employee
Nice blitz pick up 34 lmao 
Dude can't pass. He's Tebowing it
Switching QBs was a terrible decision.  No way he is fully prepared for this game and what do you do now?  Stick with the unprepared Tua or go back to the QBs confidence you just stomped on by benching him. 
They actually put Tua in... Wow 
Holy shit what an insane move.  Just blew up Hurts career at Alabama.  He's done.
MY PRAYERS HAVE BEEN HOPEFULLY ANSWERED: TUA!
BAMA IS SCARED PAWWLLLL
I never understood the barking but damn it's kinda fun to do.
All I've heard about is Bama D. I'm saying the UGA D is better. 
Putting in the back up probably Hurts Jalen's feelings 
Hmm, it's almost as if the QB isn't the only problem. 
Damn I can't believe we put Tua in. Kinda scary
Saban shook
Nope just benched
And a QB change. This is gonna work out REAL well
Frist
Overreaction: Alabama will not score a touchdown today
The thought of being a running back and having to line up one of those dudes is...terrifying
The way Saban paces reminds me of the way Pete Carroll chews bubble gum. The harder he's doing it, the worse things are going on the field.
They're going no huddle to combat the language barrier 
Press F to pay respects for Hurts
hope the raiders draft roquan
Hurts currently hurts from that change to Tua
Lets finish this bitch up DAWGS
3 and out baby fuck yeah, great way to start the half, let's go!
bama is fucked if they think throwing in the backup freshman that hasn't played all year is going to be better than hurts
Poor block by the rb, can't just throw a shoulder into the guy.
Goggles is a treasure
I''ll never forgive Helfrich for never offering Tua. 
Oh no...man fuck injuries
Eye black is a privilege, not a right.
Shit, did not realize tua is a lefty
Oh yaaaa
TuA's GOnNa SaVe ThE dAy
holy shit. i can't believe they're putting in a true freshman in the NC game
Was not expecting them to pull him
Nike should''ve put gold swooshes on the jerseys tonight instead of the silver ones. That would''ve been a nice touch. #missedopportunity
Roquan Beast
who hurt u
No, just not been throwing
But why is he in?
Saban did call Lane Kiffin I guess. 
SUCK A DICK KANSAS 
My God. I'm starting to have a bit of hope. Could UGA win? Is that actually possible?
Gotta hurts getting pulled in the natty
I''m watching the coaches broadcast and one of the coaches has a mullet HAHAHAH what 
Wow they benched him for Tua.
I changed my twitter handle to honor Blankenship and I honestly have no regrets
Now I gotta cheer for Bama cuz of Tua playing
Reddit has gotten really big
Maybe it isn't Hurts fault after all.
Anybody else feel like that half time show was weak as fuck?and I actually am okay with Kendrick Lamar's music, don't hate it or love it. but that show was just ZzZzzzZzzzZzZZz
1 more drive like that and they'll go back to Hurts.
His ego maybe
Fucking hell...
I guess I missed the Black Panther special trailer?
The absolute madmen
Bama fans this is your QB soon
georgia not letting off the gas at all
TUA!!!!!
has Tua seen the field much this year?
no just not a good passer
Is Tua Alabama's Mariota? I don't know much about him.
Got any more QBs?
You tried.
ROQUAN THE CHEF 
Yeah, mother trucker
There's not much going on to discuss right now tbh
Lol why is Bama such shit tonight?
WELCOME TO THE NF..I MEAN COLLEGE FOOTBALL
Steve Sarkisian would be winning this game for Bama right now.
Did someone say true freshman?
I can't wait for next year 
That's just mean. Humorous, but mean
Dude's a beast
Wait... who is this guy? They have that little faith in Hurts? It's only 13!
Cool. Another injury. I'm loving this season.
Anyone else suspect that firing Kiffin was the biggest mistake of Saban's career?
FUCK WHY NO POR QUE
No more injuries just more scoring on Bama
Jalen died for this, lol.
I didn't expect it that quick. Desperate times...
Hurts gotta be so mad. How you gonna pull your starter and put in an ice cold back up? 
Me too thanks
You kiddin me dude, love going 3 and out like it''s our day job 
And now the blood of sacrificial Alabaman babies begins to flow. But will it be enough?
Sheesh that is some trash blocking technique.
I can't believe they pulled Hurts for a true freshman to close out the National Championship game. Bama is really trying everything. 
Hurts gonna have a picture of Tua on his phone for the next 364 days after this.
Wtf
This is the first NCG where all the QBs are younger than me damn, I''m only a bit younger than Watson.
Is Jalen hurt(concussion) he banged his head a few times on the turf. I wonder if it's not just a benching. 
I don''t know if I love putting in Tua or hate it 
I got 2 words for Sabin. BE HUMBLE!
Haha haha....ha 
Bama has spent all season second guessing who should start at QB. 
Essentially.
Kinda feel bad for Hurts tho. Getting benched in the biggest game. Not saying it's the right or wrong move cuz idk
TUA MUCH TUNA 
DID YOU WATCH THE FIRST HALF?  Hurts was...well, hurting.
*SABAN HAS LOST CONTROL*
glad to see Tagovailoa overcome his language barrier.
I'm going to take the under.
Weak. Jalen hurts level roast
I would rather watch every episode of Young Sheldon in one sitting than watch another fucking game on WatchESPN. 
Did Saban just pull the ultimate halftime adjustment? 
I'd be absolutely devastated if I was Hurts. 
Sa/Ur?
No, no one wants Jalen
That was the hardest “motherfucker” ever recorded on video
Starting Tua 2nd half, sacked on 3rd down? Bold move ~~cotton~~ Saban, let's see how that works our for you.
this is what would've happened if Haskins came in for JT?
"one of three smart assistants that worked for saban"SO ARE YOU CALLING THE OTHER ASSISTANTS DUMB?
BY GAWD THAT'S TAGOVAILOA's MUSIC!
Put Hurts back in!!!
REALLY?
Cause he is horseshit
Benched.
He just sucked
WHAT UP BIG TU(N)A
I'm glad I watched the bands then. 
Did Saban sacrifice Hurts in a blood ritual at halftime?
imagine roquan and foster together in the nfl wowee waste of top 10 pick but who cares not me
Let''s go Bama! 
Gundy?
Dude it''s just glasses 
Two waffles, syrup in between. 
Tuned in late, did they actually bench hurts? 
He's been disrespecting us with his terrible gameplay....
Roquan Smith definitely going top 10 now... dude is a stud and really showed out the past few games.
i can say from previous experience this is a bad idea
I wonder if Jalen is embarrassed he was benched in the National Title Game. 
Sit down tua be humble
Tom Rinaldi always sounds sad. 
T U AUA^^^^^Go ^^^^^Dawgs ^^^^^tho
It''s about fucking time this thread appeared 
SACK!
great start for the 3rd quarter, WOOT WOOT!
Without Williams? Man...
Oh shit wuddup Tua.
Not another injury!!!
F
That's Mike Gundy and that mullet is a treasure.
PSA, go get a big glass of water if you've been drinking
"LETS GO MOTHERFUCKERS"- Mel Tucker
30 minutes to doom
Fuck that. Hurts had his chance.
Blood makes the grass grow! Kill Kill Kill!
Is Hurts hurt?
Exactly. He was just about to step in and throw but the o line gave in.
yea. It's easier to follow
Essentially, yeah
DAWGS
This had to have just been a 'wake up' to Jalen Hurts.He wasn't playing that bad.
Alabama? More like Poobama, am I right?
First time here?
It''s appears Nick had enough of his shit
Shouldn't surprise anyone that saw the first half.
lol we fuckkkked
Because he was the only reason they were producing yards... so who the fuck knows.
Cause he's played like ass, still surprised though 
Holy shit Saban took out Hurts...this game seriously got to his head
Everybody loves Tua
This is a fucking strange game plan
Lol at a back trying to block Roquan
Another OL down? We're done.
Fifth straight punt for bama. Insane defense by Georgia 
My man 
Jalen?! JALEN?!! OH GOD
T(r)ua Freshman takes a sack
Just got benched in the natty. 
Damn Jalen Hurts get benched? The fuck
And we see maybe it is shitty playcalling.3 plays, no Harris, no Bo, no Calvin.UGA offense can start taking knees if they want.
bama is winning
cause he can't throw
Hurts could literally transfer to any college and be a starter if he gets benched
Look, Georgia. As someone with some experience with this I need to warn you: OJ Howard is creeping about somewhere about to make a big play....DON'T TELL ME HE'S IN THE NFL YOU NAIVE FOOLS HE'S THERE SOMEWHERE WAITING TO STRIKE I TELL YOU
:D *jumps into the abyss*
"Alabama has had two QBs win the 2016 Elite 11 MVP award" ~ ESPN graphic
ohhhh that's what it means
I don't :(
o hi mark
That over/under is looking ridiculous at this point
Those are big ass crosses on his face goddamn
No, it wasn''t. I''m really pissed bc Kendrick is my favorite artist ever, and they advertised it like he was gonna be here, and I was won over to get tickets due to him. It''s fucking dumb.
Lol that halftime game thread was sooo revealing of some of the people on this subreddit.
Can someone let us know how much Tua has played this year?
Dogs are more cute than elephants
Brings in New qbGreat passerMakes him runOne short passSacked.Nice
Bama fans are you mad about that or not? Serious question.
How did Alabama even make it here?  Holy shit this is a god awful team
QB controversy!?
Been saying it all game. QB can''t fix the blocking and play calling. 
Kept getting shutdown by the Georgia D. They kept him one dimensional
#THEY BENCHED HURTS?
BAMA WILL BLEED TONIGHT!Or at least get a fuckton of fights
Well, one more TD and Bama is pretty much done. They're not getting to 21 without a pick-six
well, that wasn't cool
LET'S GO DOGS
Tua was originally wanting to play for Oregon.
Wow.
Hurts could have avoided that
I consider myself a fan of both and I would much rather watch this than Titans-Chiefs 
QB change in the natty?SABAN THE ABSOLUTE MADMAN
Joey fresh dubs is cheesin in some sorority house right now
Tagovailoa's problem is that he can't speak English, he's having trouble communicating with the team. http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/college/alabama-fan-concerned-language-barrier-hawaiian-qb-article-1.3493395
The mad lads!
If you are going to beat a team with a true freshman you better put in your true freshman. 
Literally switched out all the Bama skill players. lol
as a Bears fan, i can''t believe mel tucker (our dc a few years back) is running a good defense. good for him, though. seemed like a smart guy, just couldn''t put it together on the pro level
Hmm. I'm watching on Slingtv on my roku tv. I tried to change channels during half time and got hosed for 10 minutes. Finally back watching the game.
mariota, manti te'o, who else?
Richt was fired for that kinda benching. Why on earth would you ever do that to a freshman? 
If tua plays just okay and doesn''t win the game for them the bama fans will crus the poor guy 
Yesssss Saban actually did it 
Alabama should Fire the entire offensive coaching staff 
that means Bama loses! yay! 
Hurts was playing like dogshit.
But... Have you seen an Alabaman quarterback play for Hawaii?
Flair system slows everything down if there are too many comments 
Pretty sure Herby is having a true freshman orgasm with Tua in.
Nick has built machine and gets the best but how has he not had great QB cycle through is beyond me. You would think he would have at least 1 Andrew Luck type.
Yep
No, it was outside, the bands were on the field. 
Why did they throw that kid in?
Yes
Hurts is disrespectful to everyone else
Didn''t miss much tbh
Didn't that happen with Texas Alabama a few years ago?
Nailed it!
I called for the kid all year... I still can't believe we made the change.
Fuck watchESPN. To buffer or to quit?, that is the question. 
GO DAWGS
Why the *ungh* is Hurts being benched
THE MAD MAN
Well now Alabama knows how I feel!*grumble grumble*
Don't have hope, man. That's when Saban strikes and twists the knife.
He played like ass
Yeah , I'm sure it will be on youtube soon if it isn't already.
ROQUAN! 
Georgia''s defense is barely warming up out there. 
Just noticed the note in the halftime thread about the person on Alabama's color guard who passed away last night. Thanks for doing that, she went to my high school and I'm sure people down here would feel a little honored to know y'all did that. Respec
This kills the Bama
Yikes. That's a tough situation for that QB to step into.
Fuck your quarterbacks, 
Can't tell if trolling.
Seems like kind of a dumb move to switch QBs like that
That's gotta knock your confidence, getting pulled in the national championship, especially if you're backup sucks enough you have to go back in 
Some were calling for him in the first half.  They got him let's see what he gots.
That man has a name and it's MIKE GUNDY
Gotem
Bold move. We'll see if Tua can get it done.
eeeeh, let's not treat Dilfer like he's some sort of master scout
This kills the elephant.
Best OL hurt? RIP comeback chances
Desperation move not working.
Isn't Fromm a freshman?edit: why the downvotes? I was asking a question.
http://i.imgur.com/5xQXQES.gifv
saban is cold man
Bama is fucked because this isn''t good idea to pull Hurts
Damn Hurts with the short leash
Keep Tua in. Just cuz they went 3 and out doesn''t mean they should take him out. Give him a shot 
If Georgia scores a TD on this next drive there is a 90% chance this game is over.
And our start LT is down, 
Hurts is probably hurt by the decision 
still can't believe they actually pulled hurts
Saban didn't sacrifice the requisite amount of babies.
has nick saban officially lost control??? 
Did Saban just crack?
I don't think so...
Trent Dilfer says this guy is good...I am not sure how I feel about that.
Daboll is laughably bad. Have you ever heard of a crossing route? He has no idea how to develop a QB.
Loved all the comments about racism in the halftime thread. #sowoke Edit: /s
hurts
Did you see the first half? Shaky, no vision, missed a TD at least once, no pocket presence. 
I'm sure it will be on YouTube later. It wasn't much different from the ones they've already shown.
That's the end of jalen
**FUN FACT** Harvard Still Sucks--The rest of the Ivy League
QB decision making has been the difference of this game so far.
Tua looking like a damn cult member w that eye black
THEY BENCHED HURTS FOR THIS GUY?U N H I N G E D 
Tua is in because Hurts has no pocket presence and can't throw. Someone else will have to answer the kickoff question, I don't know that one
Crazy that Saban succeeded all these years with only 3 smart assistants
Ruquan baby love you, wish you all the success at the next level.
What's that? QB changed in the championship game? Bama implosion? Tua should have gone to Oregon, thanks Helfrich
~~Bernie~~ Ohio State woulda won.
> Have witty comment>wait for 3rd Quarter thread>mods r late>wtf>refresh>REFRESH> #REFRESH>3rd Quarter thread is up finally, 298 comments already>fuck
Really, the crosses on the face? 
BAI GAWD
What does Jalen Hurt's phone think of this?!
Yeah it slows stuff down if we dont
How did we miss out on him?
Is the screen just going to constantly have Tua''s name. We get who it is. Take the name off the screen please. 
The best way for refs to be fair is to not call things. I''m loving this officiating, really letting the boys play.
The main ESPN stream sucks. But try the hometown radio feed. Same broadcast, less people streaming it, plus hometown radio broadcasters instead of ESPN announcers!Other option I like is the sky cam or the sounds of the game stream. Sounds of the game is great cuz it''s the same video feed of the main stream, but all you hear is the crowd, the bands, and the PA announcer!
I understood that reference
They did!
Saban may have sacrificed him
I seriously can't believe he did that.  Just crazy.
Pretty sure that''s Gundy from OKSt
Tuned in at halftime and caught the end of the show.
lol at a 13 point game, especially in college, being over  
O/U on the number of times a black panther trailer will be shown during commercials? I'm going with at least 1 per break, so about ~20
don't say things you can't take back 
No downfield threat, at all.
Over
Time for short passes offense
Yo you're really gonna throw this kid into his first game action in the Natty against one of the best defenses in college football? Someone get Saban a wheelbarrow for those balls bby
Did you guys know that both quarterbacks are freshman? 
But do they have their special hand signals ready to let Tua play?
will Alabama stick with Tua? 
That guy was the best recruit from HS? 
What in the world?
Why wouldn't he be lol
It was outside. Like a block away. 
Kill Bama pls
Wait we don't get a commercial break for this? 
Wow, it's almost like our shit Oline that is the problem and not the qb
Yes
Welcome to me in 2009. 
28-3 and 31-17. Ain't close to being over. Keep choppin.
Jalen Hurts is a running back playing quarterback fight me
about 15 minutes
A QB who can actually pass the ball. Hurts is a RB not a QB
So we can watch them say motherfucker but we cant hear explicit audio from a live performance. Ok.
700 comments 100 seconds into the 3rd quarter
They finally ran out of commercials.
Not the QBs fault his RB can't pass pro
Yeah, to manage the comments better I guess. I think they do the same for the superbowl.. Or at least two halves. 
They had to adjust a lot of the offense for him because he didn't speak English 
I get that was a 3 and out but his pocket presence already looked much better than Hurts 
TUA YOU ARE TEARING ME APAAAARRRRTTT
Looove Hurts... 
He's seen some shit
It was outside
 does Eason come out for Georgia? 
Maybe it isn't the QB Bama maybe UGA D is that damn good
Edit: MY PRAYERS HAVE NOT BEEN ANSWERED WITH TUA
We are either about to see the birth of an Alabama legend or a total fucking disaster
UGA Defense Come Out From Half Fired Up!! 
Tua is going to be great, Georgia better hope he isn't today though 
Why is it so damn easy to hate Saban?
so i think we could have at least scored 3 points against georgia with JT and company.....
he gone
I bet Saban misses Lane right about now.
Does Alabama have a team hair dresser.  Their do's are outstanding.
i was making food, what happened 
Or #20 is fine with me. 
Yes.What's there not to get? He grew up so poor, he ate syrup sandwiches.
Got benched for tua
Dawgs defense looks crazy good. I imagine Thomas Davis is nodding his head in approval in the crowd lol. 
I hope the big boy is alright :(
Runnin' from that goose egg
I'm sure Kendricks is great at rap...I just didn't see the entertainment value in what he was doing. Sounding like chanting more than anything.
Shh bby is ok. 
Outside the stadium
Ha yes that QB switch worked so well
A surprise to be sure, but an unwelcome one 
[deleted]
What?!? We got their first string QB pulled???
Yea, it's a sign of a lack of wealth, meaning Kendrick is saying he remembers those rough times.
3 minutes old, 730 comments. Lord almighty 
This is the most adversity Bama has faced this decade
Hopefully this new QB will please the Dark Lord. 
Glad they got the camera off the guy crying...
Wow, that QB switch really did the trick
People bout to eat their words about it being all Hurts fault
I wish it would have been Chance instead of Kendrick. They both released great albums, but Chance donated money for education in his home town. I like Kendrick, but I don't think that performance did him any favors.
How many times do you think he'll say "true freshman" this half?
respect
Yeah, it quite literally is
 < be true freshman < daddy Saban sends you out to start second half of natty for your first real game < shit pants < come back for second drive and whip your dong out < shit pants again
Bama must have cut their players paychecks... no wonder they're playing like shit
I can't believe they took out hurts!
fuck it, toss in Tua. Let's see it happen.
Dudes gunna get rekt
Yup
They took him out on like 3rd down of this drive for Tua. 
Tuas eye black is legit 
I think Tua is a better player, but Hurts is the leader of that team. 
lol what is GOAT Saban doing?
Low hanging fruit
So what happened to Jalen? Why would they bench him ....
we're watching a meme unfold aren't we
It may be true that Alabama is a second half team, but (as evident from the Rose Bowl) so is Georgia.
Holy shit he took out Hurts
Did any of the Bama QBs that transferred out this year play?
What did the Georgia coach yell? Looked like "get ___ motherfuckers" 
Went to the same high school so sorta
It wasn''t on the field, it was built last week outside somewhere. 
Saban going into halftime: "It's not on the QB"Saban starting the 3rd quarter: "Hurts, go ride the pine."That escalated quickly lol 
Top 5 should be Rosen, Darnold, Smith,  Fitzpatrick,  and a lineman
Bama should try their punter at QB
L O L
I'm not your man, I'm a sad gooner 
kinda boring game.congrats to georgia though.  they played well.   bama.....not so much
nope but Mark Richt has
DAMMMMM
What the hell is happening
Bama needs a turnover to compete rn this feels like one of our games the past decade
I was there when Nick Saban benched his quarterback in the middle of a national championship game
D E S P E R A T I O NESPERATION
Lmao Bama
What the fuck is that hair
OH SHIT SON
Me too, however the QB change alone isn't enough for me. I want to see us tailor our offensive strategy to Haskins abilities and not run him
Can't spell Alabama without Aaaa
Believe me, no it didn't.
RIP Bama
Ah fuck
No it was outside
So it turns out jalen isn't the cause of our offensive ineptitude...who knew
ppl have different musical tastes?  oh shit
yup, clear cut penalty
Wow bailing on Hurts already. Smacks of desperation.
Even if hurts is put back in, I'm sure he'll be looking for redemption.
Dude playing like a bum this game
unless hurts is hurt that call makes no sense. bench the guy who's taken you to two straight cfb championships for an untested freshman against an elite defense?
Is Bama even at this game?
I doubt he can hit the keyhole.
Never turn down sleep when you're tired. Food when you're hungry and sex.
That would''ve been huge 
The ultimate cocktease
Offsides. God damnit. 
Off them sides 
FUCK 
Pretty sure that's on us
Offsides.
Apology for poor English When were you when Alabama die? I was at home listening to Kendrick Lamar with D''Onta when my friend call Nick Saban Kill, no 
We are actually watching Saban give up.
Hell nah
What year is Jake Fromm again?EDIT: *True freshman intensifies*
damnit to all hell
It really makes you wonder how a team like that could have won its division
Can't tell if /s
[deleted]
Good play offsides thoughEdit: I was wrong
Lmaoooo take my your upvote damnit
Could it be better than what Hurts has done?
Holy fuck. No idea what to make of this. Perhaps we are watching the beginning of the end of us. The apprentice always slays the master. It is the Sith way.
WE WANT HURTS
Bullshit. False start.
good god I want to die
I assume Tua didn't have his, didn't Garrett Gilbert burn his redshirt in the title game?
Ugh saw that coming 
Pin your ears back, Dawgs. Tua''s in for a rough night. 
Who's not drunk yet and want to die of alcohol poisoning?    - Drink every time Kirby Smart being former Nick Saban's assistant is mentioned.  - Drink every time Jake Fromm being true freshmen is mentioned.

Brutal
Georgia about to ruin the psyche of a freshman quarterback.
Lmao no he wasn''t. That is just coach speak. “Best recruit I''ve ever seen!”
[deleted]
It seems like Jalen Hurts Alabama's chances of winning
that false start's gonna bail 'em out... can't overturn those (I know, a false sta- OFFSIDES? THE FUCK?!?!
I have no dog in the fight, but I need Bama to score so its a fun game
damn i don't think he even needed to jump on that, either
Swap to one of the hometown radio ones, they're working fine. Too many people on the main broadcast.
There we go, there we go. :P
Bama is done.
You didn't happen to watch last year's super bowl by any chance, did you?
I know the feeling.
dammit ESPN it is offsides not false start
sweet jesus alabama is imploding 
To be benched for a freshman in the NCG? man I bet that hurts.
We all agree that Alabama benching Jalen Hurts is monumentally stupid right?
I gotta say, having to change to your freshman qb makes me very unconfident in bama. If he's the better option, he should have started/been starting for a while now
Saban thought Alabama's offense was so anemic that he made a quarterback change during halftime *of the fucking national championship game*They are so fucked. 
Wow, Alabama's not very good!
I''d love to see and Alabama comeback during the 4th
Damn. Oh well. 
/r/cfb: it just memes more
0-13
Dilfer is a fucking idiot.  Stop praising him.  Seriously
Most of it is that the school's bands put in a lot of time for their half time shows and they don't show any of it. I'm impartial and thought it was a good show. 
Yeah that's an offsidesAftier the replay I'm not so sure anymore
I don't get why their streaming service has gotten so shitty. You'd think The Mouse would have the money for quality streaming
the offense moved first
I dont give a fuck whats happening you dont bench your starter for the backup unless theyre throwing picks all over the place. 
Was this location for the game predetermined and Georgia got lucky it''s basically a home game? 
He would've made it without even being offside!! What a dumb mistake 
Please Georgia twist the knife
Be Honest: Would you rather have JT or Hurts at QB? 
I really wish we could listen to the ESPN Film Room but watch the game full screen.
I DONT CARE IF TUA IS IN AT THIS POINT, WE NEED SOMETHING
Hey mods, I don't think you set the recommended to New on this thread!
Alcohol?
FUCK another player down.FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK THIS GAME.
He was not offside!
Large 14 ref doesn't even know the hand signals.
Shut them out plz
Ha!
Not a chance. 
Millennials
Do you think Hurst will change his phone picture to him sitting on the bench for next season?
Shit call he wasn't across
I think we jumped it guys... edit: yeah. Edit edit: nay
Should have been false start...
Bama moved first
lol of course you can block a punt when you''re three steps ahead of the snap. 
Clearly shook
OH SHIT HE WASN'T OFFSIDES 
guys we are all just shouting and no ones actually reading this rightfdt
Shocking to see a QB change only down 13. 
that was a clearly a false start 
Bro that's a bad call
If you were Jalen Hurts, would you rather Tua came in and won, came in and lost while you sat on the bench, or you continued to play but ultimately lost? 
It gets real sunny in that dome at night 
Dude the 2nd half just started wtf
Is that offsides tho?
no way that is offsides lmao
Is there a falcon in the stadium? 
Yes the defense can false start what is this guy smokin
Hurts got DFA'd
The Flyin Hawaiian!
Uhh, I don't think that was offsides.
Not offsides!
I wish Les Miles would have had the balls to do that when we played in the championship
We need a stop and a score and another stop. The Pats pulled off a 25 point comeback with 20 minutes left. Cmon yall.
I mean, when was the last genuinely good halftime show at any football game?
Same except ~5 minutes
I don't think that's an offsides
WASNT OFFSIDES THAT WAS CLOSE
Y'all bout to taste this 5-star depth chart for better or worse. 
THATS NOT A PENALTY
Wow that was definitely not offsides lol
Shoulda been a false start
If that''s offsides he threw the flag late. 
He actually didn't look offsides
He wasnt offsides..
That's not offsides
BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Tuesday headlines: HAS SABAN LOST IT????????1????
Why would you bench your starting QB in the championship game...?
If Tua hadn't taken that sack, we'd have a 1st there.
That was a terrible call. 
I don't get the QB change, it didn't seem to me that Hurts was the reason Bama was shutout in the first half
That's horseshit
Holy shit....Refs: GOTTA PROTECT BAMA 
THATS GOTTA BE REVIEWABLECOMPLETELY ONSIDE
That actually wasn't offsides.
No we do not need Bama to score
That's a Von Miller offsides call. Timed it perfectly
BS he was still behind
That's some bulllllllllllllshit
Woooooow he wasn't even offsides
That was close...
Offsides
I love the coaches room but their streaming is so unbearable I just gave up and am watching regular espn.
bad call
That doesn't look offsides
Shut them out!
Bad call
I''d never thought I''d want that
oooooo idk about that call 
Saves by the refs
He was NOT offsides.  
I don't think that's over the line
jumped the gun there
Holy shit is Saban about to get Mack Browned? Is he gonna lose his mind?
They had to try something different. Offense is anemic and Jalen missed some throws/made some bad decisions.
GET OUT
That's not offsides
I gather that Alabama pays its players entirely in hair-coloring services.
HE WAS ONSIDES
THAT IS BS
No
> dog
That was clean AF
Ok that was stupid to bring in QB
Why should he have gone to Oregon? He's getting to play in the national championship game. 
He wasn't across the line. Bullshit call.
Can you review a penalty call? I don't think he made it across...
Holy fuck that was close
Huge callAlso wrong. Refs always call offside when the player moves early and it's bullshit
Wow, that was a lot of excitement for nothing 
God damn Espn app is laggy af to start the 3rd quarter
Lost Jonah. No big deal. Somebody shoot me. 
What a run!!!
Sounds of the game feed makes it OK
That wasn't offside
I think he was onside
That was a perfect jump
Saban pays em well enough to afford their own hairdressers
That wasn't offside. Maybe a false start though.
UGA can totally shit all over Alabama with a touchdown here.  
KIRBY! You think visors are cool!?
Oh wow that wasn't even offsides!!
BAD CALL
Wait, he didn't cross the line
Lol that was a false start.
[removed]
Wow. Dawgs got robbed. 
Now that Tua is in and Hurts out I have to cheer for Alabama. Fond memories of Hawai'ian QB's
Can you believe that dude 
BOOOOOO 
NeitherWildcat bitches
That was a bad flag.  Unlucky break.
Like I said, Tua was there so Saban could blame him. 
Ummmm he didn't cross 
RKO
i'm not sure he was offsides.
Refs bailing Bama out. Again. 
wow that's fucking bullshit
GAME SAVING TACKLE
Ohhh, replay was a lot closer!
Yup. It's a hood snack, lol.
oh my godhe wasn't offsidesedit: bama actually committed the penalty
how was that offsides
He may not have been offside 
Damn that was close as hell...I think he really might have timed it perfectly.
Holy fuck He was not offsides
apology for poor englishwhen were you when jalen hurts dies?i was sat at home drinking hot cocoa when snapchat ring‘hurts is kill''‘no''
He might not have been offsides.... That was close.
Wtf
AGHHHHH I thought he was gonna break it! 
Wow that was close but I think ultimately a good call.   Edit: just kidding totally a false start
87 jumped offsides for sure
Nah
That's a fucking bs call. He was on his side. And it was 2 people false started
That wasn't offside!
Refs saved the game for bama
Wasn't off
Wow, he''s fast af
Not offsides
BALL WAS MOVING BEFORE HE WENT
Damnit
He wasn''t in the neutral zone imo
They''re basically the same guy.
He wasn't offside
Who is the coach on the bottom corner in red in coaches broadcast? Sitting by the mullet coach 
Lol gg. Glad Smart wins it 
He was on side!!!!!!
He timed that perfectly..
he wasnt offsides at all wtf
Jalen Hurts and Bamas players are hurting 
Quit. 
Bad call
Huh, that didn't look offside.
PUT IN TUAPUT IN TUAPUT IN TUA
Fuck he's fast.
That looked like a good return 
No thanks, I'll keep drinking.
Are they going to tie every Georgia staff member to Saban? "And there's the Georgia waterboy, he once shook hands with Saban last year"
That was clean
great return, let's go dawgs
Oh man, one more step.....
The arm tackle actually worked.
phew close one
Damn he almost broke through
That was clean
totally not offsides
That was a good jump. Way to screw em over ref 
Nah, we are just watching Daboll piss away his job.  
The first song he definitely is lip syncing to a backing track... there wasnt much energy (probably cause it's cold)
Woah wait a minute. Was he actually offsides?
Tua''s got more vowels than a Greek wedding
Go Dawgs
Oh wow, bad call 
Bama just looks flat as fuck. 
*PERFECTLY* timed
**Fun Fact:  Jake Fromm and Tua Tagovailoa are friends, they met at the Elite 11 quarterback competition, met again at the Nike Opening and the All-American Bowl. "The relationship that Jake Fromm and I created at the Elite 11 just hasn''t stopped," Tagovailoa said during the week. The world is a very small place**
Is it possible Saban is gone if Georgia hangs on and wins this?
He wasn't 
Damn he almost had that return 
Damn I'd like to see another replay. He looked like he could've been onside 
Juuuuuuuust a bit offsides
How do the refs make that call?
I dont think he was offsides 
Not offsides at all? What the fuck.
Hurts gonna be back in next possession
I''m just gonna remind everyone that this is the same crew that officiated last year''s Michigan-Ohio State game. Straight lines are confusing to them.
Jalen Hurts must be feeling pretty hurt
Was that a punch tackle?
Bullshit.  That was false start. 
Hot Take:He's fast
[deleted]
Not even close. wtf. 
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""offsides"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Right? Way to wreck his confidence. 
No
Bad call should been a monster block for Georgia 
I don't think he crossed the line but that doesn't matter anymore.
Rule of two. Always
he wasn't offsides!!!!!
I would rather run the ball
Bullshit! That was a false start if anything!
Omg is the dynasty over????? /sJk still waiting for back to back Bama TD's
Knew the big10 would blow it
The benching Hurts move isn't a good look for Saban.
Bold Prediction: 200+ yards rushing this half for the Dawgs as they cruise to an easy W. 
So we should riot anyways
Hurts couldn't do shit.  Tua isn't looking much better but we can hope.
He wasn't offsides and bama had 3 people jump early
That's not offsides.
Bama got bailed out there lmao
Just turned on the game.. WTF is up with this coverage? The format is horrendous.
Benching caused hurts feelings...gigitty
Benched
[MRW turning on this game after halftime](https://i.imgur.com/jDlCSXq.gif)
wtf we playing bama ref ball now?
Wow uga robbed there by the B1G ref
REFS ARE GONNA BRING ALABAMA BACK IN THE GAME. watch
Anyone who's saying it was a bad call is blind
GO FOR THE JUGULAR GEORGIA! SHOW NO MERCY!
Filmroom is lit, they showed clearly no offsides & uncalled false starts.
Damn...that was not offside
He was gone!
"They hate me cause they ain't me." -Saban, probably
We're so shook
That looked a lot like he was onsides
Wow that's some bs 
Wow... That was a LOT closer when slowed down. Lookedlike the right call at full speed though.
Where is the holding call????
That''s a bad call. 
Perfect timing! Bullshit!!!
nope.
[deleted]
HAHAHAHAHANo
Refs trolling us. Nowhere near offside. 
I never realized it until I saw the UGA kicker, but I have never seen a football player wear glasses.  Huh
Refs got that punt block call wrong.  Was movement.
The fix is in
That was a false start. Nice job refs.
Holy Speed Batman
Ha
This feels a lot like the 2009 game, but the other way around for Alabama.
Wtf was that call? That was false start if anything....
He was totally onside
So fast they thought he broke the rules, poor guy
I can get used to this Alabama finishing second every year kinda thing.
Bad call
lol no
Yea, but Fromm has started lots of games this year. 
ooh, false start *and* UGA wasn't offsides. A double BAMMY.
Wasn't offside 
Holy smokes that man took off. 
Damn so close
no
lol that's a horse shit call.
Wow that was not offside, but in real time it looked offside as hell
That was a bad angle. Don''t judge it just on that first angle
Dumbass announcer called it a false start. 
Garbage. He wasn't across the line. Great return though. 
He wasn't even offsides!
TACTICAL FALSE START
FUCK THE REFS 
Wow onside by a mile
That's a flaming hot take 
No
He wasn't in the neutral zone, Bama got so lucky 
Lol Alabama definitely moved first
Horrible fucking call.
Alabama did a false start there. 
Ha, no.
Not offside
The only dog I have in this fight is seeing a video of a Georgia son give his dad NCG tickets and his Dad crying on Twitter.Go Georgia!
That sucks
Holy shit trying to follow this thread with the ‘Live'' feature is nearly impossible.  Can we go back to new without the auto refresh?
Coaches room is awesome. pointed out false start on blocked punt. 
Bama punter keeps out kicking his coverage.
Frankly has been the only offense he''s had is hurts running the ball. 
Nah man, this kind of thing always works
Lol
wat
My dude what 
Pac 12 refs in after halftime 
Uhh.. he clearly was not offsides..
RIGGED!
No
what a shit call
He did not look offsides. Bama got lucky
[deleted]
Delete your account
Lol not unless it's 100% voluntary
I personally think he guessed the snap
not offsides
We Ready
T R U E    F R E S H M A N
Oh, I wasn't blaming Tua for the sack, but the sack might shake his nerves
I have come to the conclusion that I am way too sober for this. 
Wow Bama got a bullshit call what a shocker.
Refs trying to save Bama.
This is fucking bonkers
Why can't you challenge an offsides the way you can with an illegal forward pass? 
Man, Georgia is over here playing like they Alabama or something. SMH
It is! You might want to check to see if you're allowing suggested sort!
If you have no dog in the fight you should be fuck bama for ethical reasons 
Wow, Dawgs got hosed. 
Dibs. Bye Muschamp
No.
Comparing a HOF qb and a team coached by Belichick to Alabama currently doesn't really match up. 
Saban down halftime buttering up the refs
........... Not fucking offsides. Wow you got ass fucked Georgia. 
I wonder how Hurts is feeling right now...
That Bama Money makes refs do strange things...
You know it 
Please don't jynx it 
Yes he is playing for his job
Dang it another injury
Bad call by the refs, he never crossed the neutral zone
I'd put Jalen back in but I don't get paid 10M
Wasn''t an offsides 
they did they did they did
No
LOLOLOLOLOLOLOL
that didnt even look offsides live
Bullshit
Poll: Would UCF have beaten Bama
He was not offsides.
Good I missed ads.
Fuck injuries...can't tell who that is. 9?
Bad call is pretty bad
Oh well
Gif? Webm?
Lol
Ayyy quavo
Because Saban dick riders 
He's already in.
No way
it was a false start on the left side, and not offsides
That returner is fast af
That flag was sooooo late.  Did the ref wait to see if he got to the ball before deciding to throw the flag?
That offsides... lol
I''d imagine that''s got to be right up there with watching the opposing team run a train on your girlfriend in terms of embarrassment and shame. I don''t know that much about Hurts, but I feel for the dude. 
he wasn't offsides
True, his interview with Richard Deitsch was really interesting. He once wanted to be a high school teacher
Lovely, more commercials. 
He wasn't offsides
I'll watch all the commercials espn wants to shove down my throat if it means I get to see Alabama get destroyed 
Lol what a terrible call
He wasn''t offside tho...
BS flag
He was **NOT** offsides
He was right on time with that block.
AlwYs
don't be stupid
Lol naw 
Wut?
They got lucky 
He was in neutral zone at snap.  Camera angle was not on LoS and distorts perspective.
You guys will be ok
Likely. He can't recruit.
Firing Saban for this would have to be the most Alabama thing possible
I''m so tired of all these god damn commercials 
Lol Saban what a great coach
[deleted]
true, but he wasnt
Feel horrible for Jalen. It's not his fault that he didn't progress. This is all on Daboll.
Shitty call and an injury to boot.  Sorry, Dawgs.
When was the last time bama was shut out in a half?
side note: Georgia player didn't block the kick. he hit the punter, the punter got the ball off, then the ball hit another Georgia player.
That offsides call was a trash as the halftime concert 
Worst qb of the Saban era. Been saying it for two years. Dude is just bad. He'd be better off as a change of pace rb imo.
no chance lol
Wasn't offside, the ball was snapped 
Man, I hope there are some commercials this half. 
That Black Panther look was no different than the last trailer.
Seen it so many times.  Getting such a good jump that it LOOKs offside.
He'll probably hang himself 
Not sure why that bogus offsides can''t be reviewed.
Bama out here looking like FSU
Does anybody know the last time a starting QB was benched in the natty?
[deleted]
Saban is a competitor. I think it's more likely he moves on if Bama wins than if they lose. 
Yup all JT has is experience over him 
He was onside booooooo
That wasn''t offside. Uga got screwed 
B1G Refs Giveth, B1G Refs Taketh
HOLY SHIT IS ALABAMA GONNA LAY A BIG OLE GOOSE EGG? Boy oh boy work is gonna be fun tomorrow at work with all the Alabama fans there
Did the Flash just return that? 
He didn''t go past the ball, which is the rule. You can move beforehand.
Peak Big Ten officiating
Not even Trent Dilfer got benched in the Super Bowl... Hurts hurting
refs gonna save alabama and give ESECPN what they want 
Regardless of the outcome this is a slow, boring game
When Alabama scores a touchdown, I think to myself "yes".
You're surprised?
It's the haunted ghost of a War Eagle
Fuck that. Alabama gets gifted a spot on the playoff. Then they get gifted a do over on that punt. UGA should be on the 15 right now. 
Will a loss here today hurt Bama' s chance at the title?
You gotta wonder if Saban is ever in pain from the refs sucking his dick so much
closer than I thought...
Doesn't matter 
Drink?
That's like UConn firing Geno Auriemma.
Are you high on crack?
/s?
ABSOLUTELY 100% NO DOUBTS
Smart to Saban, "Look at me, look at me, we're the Bama now.
Think that offsides was kind of tickytack call
Fuck Auburn
Clean on the block, but I thought he was off sides as well.
For now.
Saban and Belichick both quit and coach the Giants
###FIRESABAN
hell no
He got to the LoS right as the ball got snapped. Game saving call in favor of Bama
Whoops
Uhhhh that wasnt offsides?
Hey guys, I think he''s onside
I missed it, why is Jalen Hurts not playing? 
Hartmans got fucking rockets for feet.
Wow Bama is trash. Tide getting rolled.
No. No he was not.
Me too thanks
ESPN streaming is pirate quality lol
What a bunch of bullshit. Fuckin refs
Damn looked way off live, but that was close.
Very bad call. Not offsides
Georgia gets boned in that block
Shit call going Bama''s way. No surprise there...
Classic B1G refs
It looked like the right call live though, and you can't overturn a penalty through reviews.
Jamarcus Russell
Does Tua start next year?
Ordinarily, as a neutral fan, I would be rooting for Bama to keep the game close. But Bama really is the evil empire. I'd love to see them just run off the field. 
Funny thing, fate. Saban wins tonight and he's the greatest everHe loses tonight and Bama has one natty in 5 years on a fluke onside kick
Fucking garbage call, excellent play 87
only if it results in cardiac arrest
Easy to be bailed out by refs on a false start
Lol that call
What the fuck was that offsides call??
That was a false start. 
The refs are Oprah and Alabama is her audience with gifts like that.
so many injuries holy shit
Yeha but its hard not to throw the flag when seeing it in real time. 
Oh yeah, real good field position...compared to what they should have had, I don't think so. Huge blown call.
I hope we're not talking about that call in an hour (or 3 with these commercials).
That was an AWFUL and big call
Everyone but a bunch of Bama fans in the 2nd quarter thread
Holy fuck that Hardman dude is a rocket god damn
That was a potentially game-sealing play the refs took away. I understand why they called it, but still. 
Saban and company are being severely outcoached by Kirby and his boys. 
>  I bet that hurts.ayyyy
Same they''re both ass 
No. Bama also jumped. Poor call
Lol not a penalty woulda been easy points
I wanna see about 10 replays of that blocked punt, cuz I'm not sure...
horrible bullshit call. 
I thought he was gonna break free
Bullshit call
Good spot from Herbie there. That's poor from the refs
I think Tua is going to be great, one of the best in CFB... but if you're relying on him to play his heaviest minutes in the championship game, you're not expecting to win the game.
Lol quavo popped in 
Oh well
same
Mike Gundy, Oklahoma State
He'll leave when he decides to.
It''s ridiculous that Alabama''s special teams are all 4 or 5 stars 
Wait, I''m just tuning in. Is hurts injured or did they just bench a senior QB in the title game?Edits: oops sophomore.
Woop....go Dawgs
I think we need more commercials
same outcome
Just because Alabama fans don''t have teeth, that doesn''t mean they are blind
That dude was onside
GEORGIA KNOW DE WAE
"When he gets them off, he typically booms them.OH YEAH?
This game is not going the way I expected, but I am not complaining
Definitely a false start by two different bama players
Lot of ball to play. 
STUPID ASS REFS
same
For real bruh what the fuck
Only if Pruitt brings more recruits with him
[removed]
Thank goodness Baker Mayfield didn't walk on at Alabama 
GO DAWGS!!
LOL bama what's next? Tua gonna save you? Now the refs? Whats coming up?
Are you really gonna go there after our guy was clearly not offsides on the blocked punt?
FUCK YOU REFS THAT WAS FUCKING PERFECT
Damn. That should have been a block. He wasn't offsides
Him hesitating made it look like he jumped early. Those calls need to be reviewed.
Just because Alabama fans don''t have teeth, that doesn''t mean they are blind
Only in blowouts. 
A kick return that went for yards WITHOUT A FLAG ON THE FIELD?!Hold the fucking phone cotton! WE HAVE A DAMN MIRACLE ON TURF TONIGHT!!!!!
He was drawn almost offside by a Bama false start
Calls already starting to turn. Can feel myself getting angry 
gotta blame someone, it just happened to be hurts 
Tom Brady doesn't play for bama
He wasn't even offsides!
Refs just want a competitive game I guess 
Gotta keep Bama in it.
Mad Kirby is fun to watch.
Still better than where USC finishes.
Yes. Fully unironically. 
He was onside!
All these Hurts puns make me wanna puke out of my eye sockets
Ducking clotheslined em!
Georgia has nothing to lose and Alabama has everything to lose and it''s showing.
Doesn't matter, this will feed the dawg
I wouldn''t be surprised.
Is it megacast? You may be on ESPN2 the actual coverage is ESPN.
Dabol fucking sucks 
It was a hard call to make in real time. Easy to say after three replays from different angles. Easy killer.
To be fair to the refs that's offside 95% of the time.Had to watch in slowmo to see he wasn't 
Bama with the collapse 
Too bad
I hate to disagree with the guys looking down the line, but he (the Georgia player) sure looked to not even move until the snap...Edit: clarity
These 3-and-outs are killing me!
Saban is really trying to pull some shit out of his ass putting Tua in
No excuse for getting that penalty wrong.Terrible officiating.Nice return in the kick though.
Definitely in the neutral zone, could have been deadened on Bama penalty as well.  Pretty OK with that flag.
That might be the dumbest question in human history...  And flair upEdit: I feel kinda bad about this, but seriously flair up cause I can't tell if you're shit-talkin...  Which is cool, if you flair up
Makes that clean block even more impressive.
Saban is the Belichick of the NCAA and they are best friends.
Very iffy call goes an SEC team''s way, go figure
Wouldn't be an Alabama game this season without a critical player getting injured... come back please,  Jonah
He got Hurt
[deleted]
I mean I agree but...the result would have been the same, the block wouldn't have counted.  False starts are presnap penalties and invalidare the play.
Because he isn't playing well at all.
He just had a running start.
RIP in pepperoni 
Refs under their breath chanting *"B1G B1G B1G"*
All I can see from that white knuckles sign is goatse.cx
*Lane Kiffin giggles*
Seriously, Daboll has shown no ability to get the job done.
Because rules.
And
Either way result was probably the same. False start is a dead ball
Yep
Actually kinda glad they aren''t showing too much
Vegas is you mean
He may not have been offside, but he was in the neutral zone 
Guys. the replay is obv, he WAS offsides.
and two bama guys jumped
Benched
Well it was actually a false start which would have blown the play dead and still no blocked punt so not as big of a missed call Georgia should just have the ball 10 yards further up the field 
ALABAMAS MVP= ZEBRAS
This game is going way too late. This is going to end at like 1 EST
Should be able to challenge that. It happens often, refs call offsides when a guy gets a good jump even though they started from a yard back.
B1G refs made that offside call just to spite the SEC team in the big game
That call sucked 
Because he sucksI'm guessing anyway.
What station is it on?
has he looked good in those outings?
Absolute horseshit call
We switch refs at halftime too?
Urban and Saban should get together for some loser pizza after the game 
Y'all need to learn that offside doesn't have an "s" at the end 
Watch the sounds of the game stream on espn. It''s butter. 
Is he hurts? 
Why do they keep showing football? I'm trying to watch car commercials here 
I wonder what Joey Freshwater is thinking. 
Terrible call - that dude was timed up perfectly.
Can we start talking about the Curse of Lane Kiffin yet?
Not My Championship^TM
The Devil went down to Georgia he was lookin for a soul to steal
he was onside
Ford stole that catchphrase from a WWE tag team
Not off sides but wow half the backfield jumped early. 
Alabama and bad kick coverage.Name a more iconic duo.
At least they made up for it with the return 
Auburn sucks!
Plus bama moved first
Hawaii to Alabama must be quite the cultural change
what if when georgia was made it was just called george instead.
That....was not offside. And a missed false start.
Less offsides than Rudy was
Who brought the fuckin rocket?!
131 upvotes after 5 minutes. How did I miss out on the previous threads for this? Hot damn!
Unfortunately can't review but refs blew the call.
Are you watching the same game I am?
Bad call by the officials. Alabama got lucky with that one.
GA is playing like a true SEC team 
Nah man, then it's a Q U A L I T Y L O S S
I'd like to thank Georgia for this performance and keeping me up late drinking on a work night.  Bring on the shutout!!!
Quack
WTF B10 refs?
Because What is Lua? Baby don't hurts me, don't hurts me, no more
Me too thanks
that's exactly what i thought
FUCKING BULLSHIT THAT WAS NOT OFFSIDES
It's like the refs couldn't believe what happened and called offside after the play out of disbelief. 
That wasn''t even close to offsides!!
They must be using an "All-star" crew.
Yeah, but the right call still results in replay fourth down. 
HELLO MY BRUDDAS 
bad flag
Lucky call for Bama.
nah it might be a fluke and then they need to replay the game to ensure it is the correct outcome
3-8... 21 passing yards 0 passes across the line of scrimmage.
Does that mean Clemson was trash?
And down Tua goes - OLine looks like Swiss cheese 
it's so of ESPN to allow their ads to stream perfectly in HD and then crap the game stream up worse than dialup 
That was such a good play that the refs didn''t recognize he was onsides 
BAILED OUT
How can they pull Hurts!
There wouldnt be so many if your offense was better.  
Thanks Jeff Triplette
Shame that a great block was erased by terrible officiating.
Damn. People talking like this game is way over and there is a whole second half to be played lol
So where is Hurts gonna sit out at next year?
That was a momentum swinging fuck up by the refs who have been good otherwise tonight.I know UGA still has the ball but fuck.
Bama' defense > Georgias Defense > Georgias Offense > Syrup Sandwhiches > Bama's Offense
Is he just benched? 
Offense didn''t do well at all in the first half. 
GEORGIA KEEP THIS SHUTOUT GOING. FOR REASONS 
Ummmm.... that's not offside...
Bama is shook.
big 10 refs for ya
someone has to have a stream link... Plz share
Almost like they aren't that commonbut yeah I wonder the same thing
Looked like he did early in the season, but something got fucked up along the way :(
Second. In the SEC. West. 
the latter
Lane Kiffin always gets the W in the end
The ball was snapped well before he crossed the LOS. What a load of shit.
fuck me that was onsides
Idk that looked offsides to me..
Better late than never...
Yes
Hurts is a sophomore
Um...I''m thinking you''re blind. If anything it was a false start on bama. 
Bad call.
Maybe if Bama gets shut out it will distract you all from the fact that Ohio State lost 31-0 to Clemson?
[deleted]
he's playing like ass my dude
All the times 
He was not offsides
I thought he got a good jump. If anything, I thought Alabama was jumping
Agree, Daboll was so promising but has turned into the stalest play caller
They did nothing offensively in first half and Saban benched him
SEC championships man, they just mean more
Nah, people actually use pirated streams
That seems like it might Hurt so good 
What a load of fucking horseshit I can't believe we just got robbed of a blocked punt 
YOU HAVE TO HAVE EBOLA
Ewwwwwww 
You don't like commercials?
Lol he''s literally the greatest coach of the past three decades, possibly of all time, you good?
Is this what other teams feel like when they play us? Damn, no wonder everyone hates us. 
What a great perspective 
Benched him
Watching Jalen has been awfully frustrating at times so I get it 
It was the last song Kendrick played and then there was a Black Panther commercial right after.
Possible concussion?
Don''t care.  Bad call. 
3 people false started no offisides wtf refs
Man i hate it when the play football in between the commercials.
False start would have still negated the block lol
Last game of the year Brent. No holding anything back now.
Unless you''re a UGA fan, it''s been an incredibly boring game…
Fun Fact: These refs were also working the game when THE SPOT happened!
That's not what a fluke is lol
AND FUCK STATE TO YOU TOO BUDDY
He''s a sophomore 
Bama lucky on that one. 
these the refs from the Chiefs game?
Big 10 refs everyone 
Bama moved. 
"Told you"
Cause 13-0
My sad gooner 
CFB 2018 https://imgur.com/gallery/FjzdA
BAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
He played like shit the first half 
The latter
Rodrigo Blankenship aka Colombian post malone
Georgia is really out here
^dilly dilly 
Hurts isn't a senior
Good thing ESPN agrees
FUCK YOU REFS
Can't believe they switched. Never thought I'd see Saban blink. 
I thought Refball was only in the NFL. What the hell?
You have to excuse the B1G refs, they just ain't use to that SEC speed. 
Since it would have been a false start the play would have been blown dead anyways 
And he didn't throw the flag till the punt got blocked
Benched.
[deleted]
False start on the right guard anyway. This game is starting to look one sided already.
I thought it was a false start more than anything. Was gonna say I guess they''re letting it go. 
Still waiting to see if UCF runs out of the tunnel at the end of the game...
It really takes a shitty kind of fan to cheer when there''s an injury on the other team.
yes
Eh
When Alabama gets shut out, people are going to question Saban for changing QBs. Fucking stupid 
He sure didn't look offsides. Just perfect timing. Anticipation whistle but the refs.
I just knew Big Ten refs would screw this game up.
TEACH AN OLD BOXN E W * T R I C K S
That wasn't close to offside. Refs just threw the flag because the punt was blocked.How much does Saban pay, NCAA?
Sorry Bama. The real national championship was last week. 
2011 Championship game vs LSU for sure, don''t know about anything more recent than that
He STOPPED to go back on sides! Bullshit call. 
inb4 george - wasington 2024 cfp finals
True haha. We haven't been good since the Pete Carroll years, but silver medals suck.
2009: McCoy injured2011: Bailed and got rematch2012: Only got a chance because OSU was banned2015: I''ll give you this one BamaLuckiest team of all time.
He was waaaaaay offsides, but should've been a false start on Bama
Not a quarterback.
Poor first half and Bama has been second guessing who to play at QB all season. 
What the fuck is your flair combo?
Can't wait until Sabam throws his players under the bus.
I was just thinking I should buy a truck, do you guys know any good ones?
Apology for poor EnglishWhere are you when Bama was kill?I was sitting at Dinsey with knights when Saban calledElephant is kill No
Such bullshit. The not only wasn''t it not offside. It was false start on bama. 
I thought he was gonna break off a big return there.
[deleted]
Georgia is doing to Alabama what analysts thought Clemson would do to Alabama 
[deleted]
I hope the language barrier isn't too much for him. 
Herbie is a damn pro.
21 yards passing in the first half
Fuck Baker Mayfield, he gets shook under pressure!
Maybe he'll come back to the B1G so he can do better in bowl games
It really was a perfect block. If anything, Bama moved first. 
Senior? Try again 
Sophomore QB and he''s not injured 
They benched him. It's fucking crazy. 
If it was false start the block would have never happened. Everyone calm the fuck down
https://twitter.com/Lane_Kiffin/status/950544378849910784
Tuesday's headlines: It Was Smart All Along...
No he just fucking sucks 
Pats didn't bench their starting QB when they were losing badly. I will say though Saban will be on another level if this pays off.
You legitimately don't think Saban is a great coach? 
Not offsides AND bama false started.  Stupid fucking non-conference refs
This is all in the past now. But I just wanted to bring-up the point that you can't decline a false start even if they let the play go on.So if Bama moved first, we're only talking about a 10 yard swing, not the potential to have a blocked punt.
If he transfers, he transfers.
[deleted]
Because Helfrich was awful. Hope Tua works out for Bama next year
Wat
Agreed
Would it be unreasonable to want to see Landon Collins fight someone if Bama loses??
UCF already has it locked up so, nope 
I'd like to see some other team in the final four, thanks...
is it just me or are there a lot of commercials
[Georgia right now.](https://i.imgur.com/LoidOqX.gif)

Nah.
Of the nice weather in Boca with no stress
I'll still rolling with my tide..we only need one big play 
Alabama and bad kickers?
I think it's right on both counts
Because he can't QB. 
I'm a firm believer in transitive property, so definitely. 100% certainty.
Benched him, he did nothing the first half, but then again the entire Bama offense did nothing 
Bama fans so quiet....where them Flairs? Busy paypal'ing those refs? 
3 people false start? Nope, offsides!
Worked for Richt with Bauta. Keep him in Saban 
straight benched 
You're high 
Lol you guys just got so fucking lucky. You were the ones who false started, the UGA player was still onsides at the snap. The block kick should''ve counted. And you are complaining about a hold on the return?
Review every call...except that one!?!
Not a block guys. Play should have been called dead.  
Nah
That stutter step made him look guilty
Lol. Oops.
Yeah y''all got robbed on that. If anything, Holcombe jumped early. 
Don't sell the pirate streams short. Mine is great.
Shh shhh we aren't allowed to complain about shitty calls

/R/cfbstreams
/r/cfbstreams ?Edit: damn they took everything down 
RAVIOLI RAVIOLI GIVE ME THE TAGOVAILOI 
many of their fans need that. I know plenty of once insufferable OSU fans who were humbled and tempered by the couple of bad losses they've had in the last few seasons.
go to r/cfbstreams
At what point do networks like espn, nbcsn, fs1, etc realize that everyone has cut chords and is streaming so they need to update servers to keep up?
apology for poor englishwhen were you when bama dies?i was sat at home eating fried chiken when finebaum saybama is killno
He had a terrible first half 
Umm no lol
Dude. No. Stop.
He got benched. 
21 to 0 type of slow and boring? 
He timed that perfectly! In ref defense it looked like offside Live!
I've never said to someone, "The app chooses you".And ESPN can't stream shit. 
Never
Maybe...
He's feelings are probably hurt.
Alright Rudy. No he was totally on, that was a false start.
I have heard Humble at least 200 times over the past year. Didn''t need to make it 201.Also, would much rather see the bands who put in a shit ton of time and effort. 
r/cfbstreams
At full speed it did look like he jumped but on the replay looks like he timed it so perfectly and that Alabama moved before the snap.
Nahhhhhhh
They really need to reshow the replay of the offsides from the sideline view. If I saw it correctly, he jumps early, stops, then continues in for the block. I think the refs assumed that the jump/stop caused him to cross the LoS, but I don't think it did.
Hurts cant complete a forward pass and is hanging onto the ball WAY too long. Cant say i blame Saban
I know. Different country even
We can only hope.
Nothing will distract us
Nah.
I mean that was technically a false start on Bama 
Yup exactly this is the same crew that called osu Michigan 2016 :(
He wasn't even offside.  Huge break for bama
“So. Many. T R U E F R E S H M A N N N N N N.” - Kirk Herbstreit
i dont understand what that commercial has to do with Northwestern Mutual at all
Oh boy, would they ever forget about you guys
But what if they're both SEC teams?
Jarvis Wilson??
It makes it slower when they take away a blocked punt
When is the ball officially snapped? When movement starts?
And a strong language barrier cause it''s a different country /s
[deleted]
Lol
He hurts
damn can't believe they took that blocked punt away 
Definitely not NFL playoffs
FOOT WAS IN THE CREASE 
Oh it was close.  Don't think he was, but it was a close call. 
Anything's possible...but no. Bama is not a good a matchup for them.
He was moving too fast for B1G refs
Just because the Tide have 0, if the score was flipped you'd be loving it.
Seems odd considering it's not really a judgment call like holding or pass interference (which should also be challenged but whatever). Either he was across or he wasn't. 
SEC team getting every call tonight smdh 
It looked like it live, but the replay shows the twitching Bama line and that he wasn''t offsides 
I hate when this comment is overused 
Technically different, but effectively the same thing.
http://www.espn.com/watch/player?bucketId=2&id=3265225
Hopefully it goes back to more vertical routes like when cardale was playing 
Alabama needs some magic 
A Hawaiian QB balled out in Kansas City on Saturday too
That Georgia player wouldn''t have gotten hurt if the fucking call had been correct, let that be known.
UCF would be up by 30 against either of these teams guise
No one will ever be distracted from the fact the Ohio State lost 31-0 to Clemson 
Or three
Lol
Because it was... refs called it wrong
It's ok, Dawgs used to getting fucked by three refs
[deleted]
A national championship is at stake. WTF are you talking about "Georgia has nothing to lose"?
There was some sort of shift just after the Tennessee game. We stopped using our running backs, and started treating Jalen like Tebow.
Are these players paid to go down for more commercials? 
Bruh ... Wtf
Sorry nothing will distract us from that
Bye bye lil Sebastian (aka jalen hurts)https://i.imgur.com/VEe1Jp2.jpg
he is ass my dude. has been all season
This is a stretch my dude.
Nice flag ref, wait to see if he actually gets there or not before deciding to throw it. What a load of crap.
Awful call. Should be reviewed. 
PAC-12 REFS ARE THE WORST!
Refs for MVP
That's rough man 
Dude was onsides, but I'm not sure he actually blocked it. Looked more like he ran into the punter when he dropped it. (Not sure if that's legal or not but whatever) missed a false start and called the offsides wrong anywaysEdit: he totally hit ball
Not if this ends 31-0, then it's just voodoo
Who would you rather win auburn fans?
Ole Miss 31  Mississippi State 28 FINAL
Benched but I think he's a sophomore 
lmfao this made me laugh out loud man it''s still Nick Saban-led Bama.
Can Alabama stop Georgia, though?Particularly once it comes to third down?
> one natty in 5 yearswhat a chump
Drink every time the announcers revisit Saban's decision to swap QBs
I don''t even think it''s close. Looked clearly on. 
Lol I didn't expect it to take off like this
NCAA 2005 Update: I had to eat a snack but I'm back and restarting the Florida - LSU game with 1:52 to go in the 3rd with my Gators team up 11-0. LSU ball at their own 21, 3rd and 7, Gators looking for another 3 and out
Do you believe that we can win this fight tonight?
Offside. Singular. No s. 
Nah, I can.
Does anyone know what the "live (beta)" comment sorting does? Because it isn't even refreshing for me.
Friendly reminder that this is the B1G official that reffed the "JT was short game"I don't care about the spot, but he is notorious for making calls that are ass, my dude
The language barrier must be a bitch.
He''s a sophomore but yeah he''s resting.
They've prepared special hand signals for him I've heard
how the hell are y'all keeping up with individual comments on here
Fuck Alabama. And fuck the refs and fuck the Alabama announcers in this game. 
The issue with changing to a passing QB is if you do not trust him to ACTUALLY THROW THE BALL DOWNFIELD it kinda makes the change meaningless. But I don't get paid millions to make that decision...
Lol
Hes a Sophmore.
I think he hit the ball with his hand before he hits the punter.  
Insides you mean.
Disney is just making sure that ESPN maximizes the brand synergy
There''s a Hold My Beer comment in there, somewhere
Definitely a bold move though. I wasn't expecting it either.
At least the commercials are always crystal clear on ESPN streaming
I'm watching their homer stream. Any of the minor ones that aren't the main broadcast should be better due to fewer viewers
Thats not nice
Let us take this moment to remember that Texas lost to Kansas.
i've seen a Hurricane that Rocks
Lane Kiffin foresaw this outcome...
Bama's D/ST is gonna have to score points for them to have any chance now.  Not looking good :(
Same
I prefer cash
No the one sitting by him, two to his left 
Penalties are called at full speed. In slow-mo you could see he was onside, but refs don't call the game in slow mo. Bad call and a break for sure. 
Take my upvote lol
How much have you had to drink?
Defense is playing their hearts out but they aren't getting any time to rest.
it's madness 
Thank god! I was tired of this football getting in the way of my commercials
Comments moving too fast... I love my girlfriend. 
Is there any chance that Hurts transfers this offseason if he doesn''t come back in this game?
Those type of people are the worst.
Bama definitely moved first and I dont even think Georgia player was offsides even if they didnt
Probably wackin it
I dunno when was the last time a mediocre QB1 was tested in the Natty after getting by a cupcake 7 home game and 0 out of conference road game schedule?
YouTube TV has been strong. Watch ESPN app is garbage.
I could see him changing positions.
replay showed they jumped first, and he was onside before the snap.  Would have finished this game, but I'm surprisingly not worried at this point.
Like all of the jags fans the other night when tyrod was knocked out.
I don't know, the 0hi0 State thing lends itself to the memes. 
You shouldn''t be acting surprised, we''re used to this with these B1G refs lmao 
georgia is doing to alabama what alabama does to opponents
Adorable.
Right 
Helfrich not making a play for him. He idolized Mariota but they didn't try. Taggart did when he became coach but it was too late.
[lol Lane Kiffin](https://twitter.com/lane_kiffin/status/950563144744755201)
And a 3 and out...
Of course
Salty fan is salty
After glasses kicker, obv
Bama is lucky to be in the playoffs. Expect nothing less 
When the ball moves backwards
UCF
lol you sir, have earned an upvote
For what it's worth I'm pissed there's a halftime show at all, I just don't get why people specifically seemed to have a huge bone to pick with Lamar/the performance itself, it was pretty decent (or as decent as any halftime show can be). 
I had no idea Alabama had a Hawaiian at QB. Going to be watching a lot of Crimson Tide football next season. 
Like 10 quarters cumulative probably
not here. use /r/CFBStreams 
r/cfbstreams
Still Bama should''ve been punting 10 yards further back. 
Ok, I''m gonna call it. Kiffin put a curse on Alabama. They will from henceforth make it to the championship game, and then complete fall apart until Lane dies, and breaks the curse. 
If Hurts has any years left, he should leave immediately. He just got done dirty. Saban clearly doesn''t care about him as a player.
Georgia got screwed on that call.
Youtube tv sucking balls right now...like I am in bizzaro world, watch espn is working flawless for me now.  
https://youtu.be/EZD1f9RTEJU
Probably 
Playing like ass 
The offense seems to be hiding
Agreed
Daboll is why they lose. So Alabama takes 2 Ls. Daboll minus 2 Ls makes him Dabo. Dabo beats Alabama again. 
You watchin this game?
Must you kick us while we're so sad?
It's fun to mix things up. 
Do you no de wey
No but they would have but either one crushes Michigan.  
Do you have a stream for it??
Cause he is a glorified RB instead of an actual QB
Harbaugh can watch through the window
Then it''s a joke. Congratulations lol 
There''s a couple more it seems 
If this score holds up, do you think there may actually be enough ap voters that go for UCF? I could potentially see it. 
It was lost long before then.
in real time I thought he was offsides... I don't blame the refs for that one
That is the dumbest shit ever. You don''t put in a true freshmen who has barely played this year in the national championship. I get playing him next year, but that is fucking stupid. 
A double bad call. Kicking team moved and receiving team DEFINITELY NOT offisides. Total horse shit. Does a double negative make the right call come out now?
Bama just dodged a huge bullet with that blocked punt
This is the type of reason when riots are allowed.
Yes
Dilly Dilly
Alabama and not stopping on 3rd down
/r/cfbstreams 
Bullshit all around
You sir need a flair and some water to sober up
Can anyone help me find the Bama fans? I think they got lost in the 2nd quarter thread.
Refball all day. 
Liar
go to watch espn theylet you use any tv provider to "log in"major streams suck so i would advise trying the data or command center streams just don't use the primary espn stream
I mean it's a 2 score game in the 3rd quarter. It's hardly over.
Didn't think I'd be agreeing with an Auburn flair during these threads tonight.
When he left Saban, he was just the learner, now Kirby is the master
Why you gotta bring that up?
Yeah, but now UGA can run more time off the clock. 
Same. 
I like Bama just to piss people in Ohio off. I also have always played with Georgia on the NCAA football games....idk what to do. OSU fans get real pissed when Alabama wins so I kinda want that. 
It''s completely sarcastic. It was just so many people commenting on how “incredibly smart” they are.
I'd rather earn a silver medal than get donkey dicked in the Cotton Bowl.
We going to act like overturning a turnover on a fucked call is not a big deal because "Alabama is already dead." They arent even down by two fucking touchdowns at this point. I'm salty prematurely about that block, hell fucking no. 
lol that's also how many posts are coming in
Cry about it somewhere else please, there's an actual game happening rn
"no"
She's 7?!
Playoff Committee over there just *mashing* that "Biased Officiating" button. 
Idk ask the guy in Cleveland he has experience with this kind of thing
Ref waited til it was blocked to throw the flag. Looks real shifty IMO
What a nice guy 
This is a very reasonable take 
I feel ya on that one.
Whoosh 
Would have been kicked from 10 yards further back
i'm not
You don't
The hate flow strong in this one. 
These calls. 
Aw how nice :)
He is terrible at throwing the ball and holds their team back, now I wouldn't have pulled him mid game but no way he was the starter next year. 
You're right, Dawg
Oh oh it''s magic!
WatchESPN is literally the worst
I want a long bomb from Fromm to finish Bama off.
Jawjaw looks better/hungry 
It's just you
And hurts is Tom Brady? Come on. It's not the same thing. Not even close. 
Not only was it a false start...but he was also onsides lmfao. Wtf.
He was unquestionably in the neutral zone.  He held up in an already illegal position.  That's flagged every time.
She loves you too.
Me too!
This is missing games. 
Enjoy your chicken
Zero offense in the first half. At some point you have to try something different. An anemic offense can stress even the best defenses of all time. 
You're welcome.
NO ERA PENÁL!
QB is a generous term
Should have been a blocked punt mannnnnn
I agree. I had to scroll down far enough to get it to stop which I think would be the same as just using “new.”
You don't have to wait, he already threw Hurts under the bus.
I've noticed UGA and Bama being cool all season to each other. Don't be a dick and ruin it. 
Kinda, just didn''t think it''d happen in the championship game. He''s been Ass all year
come on dawgs!
I love your girlfriend too
As a fan of a PAC-12 team, these refs are making me feel at home. Thanks guys!
I'm telling her
Wow that's a terrible call.
I might need to go back to Netflix 
alabama SUCKS 
It would be kinda fucked up to allow that to be challenged in a normal offensive play. QB sees the flag go up, he knows he has a free shot to take a chance down field. If he gets picked and then the offside is overturned... What do you do? Does the pick stand? 
possibly.  When I played ball my coaches would always say that good refs would only call the penalties that mattered.  He may have waited to see if the guy made an impact before deciding to toss the flag.
Needed a pick six on UGA''s last drive before the half. I don''t see us pullin it out tonight unless we get a passing game happening.
I like you 
One s, in the middle.
Blow them out Georgia, I am loving every minute of this.
And two Bama players false started.
Has it become the Kiffin Curse? Will Alabama ever win a national championship again?
It was definitely a false start though 
I''m excited to see Tua even if we lose. 
False start and no offsides, nice
Why cant Bama ever get good QBs? 
It would be fine if they didn't catch the false start, but they called the dude offsides when he hadn't crossed and negated a blocked punt. Terrible.
LeBatard is eating. They didn''t know Hurts had been taken out of the game.
Big if true
How else will I know what REAL PEOPLE think about Chevys?
I wish
I thought it was offsides before the replay and i hate you guys.
TED BUNDY WAS A HUSKY
Georgia, I'mma need you to score a bunch so I can go to bed...
After two years in a row, can we stop putting teams in the playoffs who can't even win their conference? Especially if they can't win their division. 
Absolute poison
it's suppose to post the comments as they're posted. but as it is now it's usually really laggy and or way too fast to even be able to read/reply to others
Oh he's been very bad, but I'm still surprised. His flaws have been on display all season, not just tonight
Not tonight son
Dilly Dilly!
M E R C E RERCER
I hate Bama as much as anyone, but that really wasn't a bad call by the refs. 
you're like ten thousand candles in the wind
Bit they didn't call a false start.  They called Offsides.
Who? Are those lacrosse teams?
I think maybe 12 sentences won't have the words true freshman in them.
There was an old blog post where a Bama fan asked if there would be a language barrier with this true freshman QB from Hawaii, or maybe asked if he'd need a translator. Something along those lines hahaEDIT:I was a little off, but here's the [source](https://mobile.twitter.com/BenReiter/status/907934854297346048?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fd-37517970443930805339.ampproject.net%2F1513979839742%2Fframe.html) 
i seen UCF have a parade at disney
Bama caught a HUGE break with the bad offsides call .. would''ve set them up in the red zone
There's only room for me true freshman in this game!
Dilly Dilly!
It was a 4th down, you still got the ball. Calm down lol
If Georgia drives down the field here and scores I don't know how Bama comes back the way their offense is playing... 
As was already said, the false start would have negated the block
I attended the entire Timberwolves game in person, which also started at 7 PM CST/8 PM EST. I am back at my home watching the NCAAF CFPCGP with basically a half to go. It's not like it's even a high scoring game. How tf is this going so slow?
PayPAWWWl'ing
Here''s the deal. Hurts is not the kind of quarterback who can dig you out of a hole. He is a bad passer and does not go through his reads well. Georgia is shutting down the run, and Bama will need to throw to get back into this game. Tua is probably the better thrower. Even though Tua went 3 and out on his first series, think Saban made the right call here if he wants to win this game.
17, 32, AND 34 all flinched
Has anyone ever yanked the starting QB in the natty before for bad performance??Kinda feel like this is one you ride and die with the guys who got you there. 
Desperation
Welcome.... welcome!!!!
THANK YOU
Nick Saban''s control freak ways are starting to bite him big time. Maybe get an offense that isn''t stuck in the 60''s Nick and maybe let your OC''s do their jobs.
Did you not see him miss Ridley who was wide the fuck open by 10+ yards? Inexcusable. Especially combined with how he is unable to get the ball out when pressure comes and resorts to scrambling every time.
Because we got picked and exposed Clemson
 But Toledo''s not even there...
www.espn.com/watch/player?bucketld=2&id=3265229
Hot take: Alabama isn't doing very well. 
the coaches commentary as actually so good
I was getting worried, but I made it. 
Hey look at it this way Georgia fans, at least this crew didn''t make an incorrect controversial call against your team while playing your biggest rival with the game on the line :'') *it hurts to live*
I back Saban's decision because UGA knows they don't have to worry about the pass game with Hurts in the game it seems. At least this way, we can make it 7-13 possibly. We have 0 points right now.
WatchESPN, can you go more than 30 seconds without buffering? Yeah that's probably asking too much
If Bama gets shut out, that would be nice.
Good guy Bama fan. I thought it was offsides 100% at full speed too
refs rigging this for the sec, wow
man that dude is fast. He was not offsides
Wow he was not offsides
Bama haven't watched y'all all year. I'm nervous as fuck but how you feeling?
That goodyear commercial about the blimp and college football may be one of my favorite commercials
At least they aren''t PAC12 refs.
Hurts being 25-2 as a starter for Alabama is probably only like 8 games better than I would be in his place 
Yeah, dude has no idea what he is doing. Saban is past his prime. Edit: /s
It has been awful for me all night
You maniac... I have witnessed your lunacy and I wish I never saw such a vile comment 
Well he went 3 out 4 before that
Oh boo fucking hoo you false started and our guy wasn''t offsides for the punt that was blocked 
Folks, I call him Tua Tagalongoa, because his decision making was about as good as a pre-teen girl.
i think that is one thing we can all agree on
Is it freezing like every 5 seconds because that's what mine is doing
It's just you. Way too much football.
Roll turd
I would rather see them up by 20
Saban should put in the waterboy. It worked that one time for that one team once.Edit: guys, I know what the team was. I worded it that way on purpose. 
Your stream sucks ass, ESPN
Kirby has Saban truly shook and the players sense it. I never expected this. I love Kirby
We have that SEC speed
Bama dodging a bullet.  
Bullshit. I'm a Cubs fan and we had to wait way after the goat's or the dude's death.
Neither. Pros and cons to both teams winning and losing 
U watching the same replays as me?
QB/RB/WR/OL
Thats what I want to see more of, and leave the running to our studs of which we have 2 with Weber likely being back. We have the talent at receiver, JT just couldn't throw it. The Michigan game this year made me.extremely happy about Haskins.
If it was a false start its basically the same outcome
getting real sick of the refs suckin bama dick
Tbf the false start would've endded the play
Was a false start though, so it still shouldn't have been a blocked punt
2016 against LSU 
I'm gonna feel real stupid if Alabama makes the comeback with Tua at quarterback. Edit: oh god no it's happening
I am FUCKING LOVING THIS
An entire half of football and the best play we've had is a pick we overthrew a wide open Ridley on and then false started ourselves out of a field goal. 
Oooooh, you have my interest now. I'd love to see what that feels like. 
Alabama announcers? Herby has been praising you all game and definitely saw the false start instead of the offsides. Also, fuck the refs. 
34 flinched by a mile
False start is a dead ball ply negating the block anyway 
is that a lacrosse reference
I gotta tell you my friend, I wouldn't sleep or get cocky on Bama until the clock strikes zero. But you are looking good.
100% agreed. Last season was horrendous. This year was the same. Put him at running back and find us a new god damn qb 
That is really a shame. We need to keep that pipeline open. 
"not a reviewable play"well damn it make it reviewable
Every play should be reviewable or no play should be reviewable. No in between.
Switch streams. The primary one is terrible. The alternates are fine
Instructions unclear. Killed Finebaum.
Technically correct, the best kind
cant get vanilla
That good year commercial is the worst. Starts feeling so epic and then ends up with a dude calling college football "blimp worthy" whatever the balls that is supposed to mean
Ram 1500
Georgia is probably going to score a touchdown on this drive. 
It's right in the sense that he shouldn't be out there. It's wrong in the sense that it didn't happen 10 weeks ago.
Well now that you brought it up, I do remember that
in the past on mobile it's essentially streamed the comments.  Normally too fast to read
True.
Saban wants to win... He don't care about the players. Means to an end
I mean at least Alabama made the championship game.
It kinda requires having sides open to pass.
Not without some flair
Yessir 
Bama made the mistake of peaking emotionally against Clemson. They can't find the same amount of drive against Georgia because they truly wanted revenge on Clemson. It's like in Alabama's minds, they already won the War and this is just a battle. 
The refs said they were from the Big10; they neglected to say they usually call basketball games.
Gatorade.....
No way, the coach just told him he has so little confidence in him he would rather play an underprepared freshman.  That is going to tank morale and confidence which are important to making split second decisive decisions.  Even if it doesn't trying to get redeption will fuck with his mind space. Mentality is really important to making accurate split second decisions.
Either way if they actually called it right there would''ve been no play
What is offense
They fucking stop the game to review practically everything. Why are there even things they can't review that actually matter
Hey, it plays smooth through the commercials and that's what we're all here for.
I have no dog in this fight. No pun intended. I do kind of favor the underdog though, and Georgia is not disappointing. 
Offsides should be reviewable. 
Calls going Bamas way now. Just a matter of time before it's 20-13. Fuck...
> Savannah
You guys got this, don't sweat it.
I want a shutout
Jk Scott should have thrown the ball on the first snap, wide open receiver
So did Joey Freshwater. 
FYI. We're about dead least in penalties called in our favor...
DID YOU KNOW THAT THEY WERE IN HIGH SCHOOL LAST YEAR
CAUGHT RED HANDED
the real mvp is the bama punter for not flopping
Yeah and Helfrich chose not to recruit him because Helfrich. He could have been all ours. 
This isn't Chubb's game
Saban has only ever cared about players that can help him. He's not at all loyal or faithful.
Uh huh
We've done a great job of stopping Chubb but Michel hasn't exactly been our Belle
Ger dergs
God damn that woman has huge hands.
What is this a Tennessee game?
But ... They're both SEC?
They didn''t expect to land in the National game. I''d assume to them it''s a bonus and they are hungry.Alabama was expected to be here.
Is Kirby Smart really just a more charming Ted Cruz?
Bullshit offsides call
Terrible, I can''t believe the refs are just gonna let the SEC win tonight.
Not what I saw. Offsides and false start. Pulling for you guys though
Holy fuck Maria Taylor is 6'2I'm gonna marry her
I call itBlump Worthy 
Crazy fucking refs.
Thanks
The moment movement starts. 
Ok good I was worried
Hold up did I just hear Rodney Harrison? My Patriots senses started tingling lol
Yes please.
What's the difference? You're still a loser like us haha.
When does the UCF game start?
More like 5 seconds
At least we didn't have to face those Juggernauts from Orlando.
13 points is not as bad as 25 points either. 
Our defense came to play (aside from 3rd downs). Our offense needs to step the fuck up ASAP 
The point seems to be more that if offensive tackles get a microsecond benefit of the doubt on timing the snap (via false start non-calls), so should defensive players.
Terrible call on the punt. Hopefully it does not really affect the outcome all that much.
Nah the commercials are ruining it.
Omg why would that ref just ruin the out come of this whole game with that flag. That not only wasn't off Side but also Alabama had a false start. Complete garbageAlabama can't win this game without it being a farce now. That was huge and total garbage.
[MFW I play this drinking game](https://media2.giphy.com/media/imo5ZLAkeR9zG/200w.gif) 
He's the backup under development. Though after this, he might be the starter.
Not, uh, not good.
Make penalties reviewable 
Settle down, Swagger
Game sealing? Way too much time to tell, but def a ahitty call 
Add -"stream" between reddit and .com to get live comments.>reddit-stream.com
We''re fucked
Two NOTs would make me feel better. 
It''s nice to feel like we belong in some manner in the CFP
Great drop in, Monty.
Hey guys.
It almost worked for Texas that year Colt got hurt right? That's the only time I can remember a freshman coming off of the bench in the NCG
Then negates the block too. 
Off and false start 
Not his fault. This dumbass coach doesn''t trust the guy that almost won him one last year. 
What the fuck was that
It wouldn''t surprise me if he has a body count tbh.
A false start call would have negated the block too
Thought auburn fans would just be miserable in this game.
Seriously though. They have been terrible this year. 
soooo maybe clemson was a teeny bit overrated this year?
Maria can get it
That was a poor decision. 
Yall think Kirby's gonna treat his family to some Waffle House on the way home after this game?
I''m playing 06 lol.
I found it through ESPN 
Why is he going back like that
GO DAWGS
u/GrumpyBearBank couldn''t reply in the last thread cause it was locked but the Eagles are still touring (will all original members I believe), Styx, Guns N Roses (or Slash''s solo stuff is dope too), Ozzy has a farewell tour but said he''ll still do shows after, Metallica/Iron Maiden (if they play tamer stuff cause you know they would be forced to), Foo Fighters (newer but great), AC/DC still going strong. Long story short there''s still a ton of older bands I''m sure the older and younger generations would like. All the bands I just named have hits that everyone knows (maybe not Maiden tho). I guess I''m biased cause that''s the music I like though. 
that call bout to change the damn game
I would probably pay more attention and possibly buy more shit if some company sponsored 30 seconds of quiet for their commercial.
God news. This is the last CFB game of the year. 
Agreed.
It''s Tua. Oregon was his dream school and he looked up to Mariota. Even went to St Louis High School. Helfrich didn''t offer him a scholarship. 
Face mask????
Wrong way. 
FFS just make the steam 480p and stop the skipping and buffering! I feel like I'm back on RealPlayer.
I'd be inclined to agree with you, but last week happened.
If we're going to stay with four teams, that should absolutely be a requirement.
Rigged for Alabama. 
No facemask???
woof.
Maria's voice is da' real MVP
Brought to mind the book "Take Your Eye Off The Ball". Talks about the prep that goes into these games and putting in a new QB may completely change the offense and gameplan- not good on the fly because it limits you to certain plays. Defenses can eat you up by recognizing your 2 executable plays out of x formations.Scary scenario if you're on this stage for the Natty.
Not a senior and can't throw the football so, benched
Of the guy crying?
Playing the whole season only to be benched in the second half of the championship game is borderline cruel and unusual punishment.
WatchESPN wtf. Doesn''t help that the fucking commercials are always proclaiming how great it is
Bonehead play
Bama's defense is finally coming out to play got dam
What an idiot 
That....Was really stupid.
Face mask?
Cautiously confident.
Do you even spell, bro?
I was playing fortnite during the half actually had my heart rate above resting for a minute. Definitely more exciting right now. 
Yes, Auburn fan here but serious question. Why are Bama fans so quick to call for Hurts head? I understand he had a rough first half, but my God, the kid is a sophomore and he''s 25-2. If I were him I''d seriously consider transferring. 
Facemask?
That wasn't a facemask?
FACEMASK
Not enough borderline targeting penalties yet.
Missed facemask
WHY ARE YOU RUNNING THAT WAY
Facemask?
how fucking bad was Clemson
Freshman mistake
I believe in Tua! Lead us to the promise land.
Swift you have to shake them off
Was that not a horse collar?Edit: nope, face mask. 
But bama tide roll 
Seriously?
Well other than Auburn beating both this teams and the fact he''s a true freshman, yes
FACEMASK
Uh facemask?
Was that not a face mask?
Facemask?
Where''s the face mask?!?!?!?!?
....facemask?
Face mask!
Freshman mistake
Don't do that shit come on
Oh man....
Wrong way there buddy 
Facemask?
Hi
How can you score 13 points with two field goals? Teach me your magic!
No facemask???
I love seeing white people dance to DMX. Reminds me of high school. 
Facemask?
No face mask?
Looked like a face mask
No face-mask call?
Was that an uncalled facemask?  Looked like it.
FACEMASK?!?
That was less than optimal.
SWIFTLY going the wrong way... sorry
2nd half bama defense has directv
Hurts accounted for 71 out of 101 yards (passing included)
You're right. Thanks for tipping me off to it.
That's the most obvious face mask I've ever seen
Face mask there? No? 
That's not how this works...
It actually was if you watch replay 
Bad decision Swift
Hurst got benched?
WTF STOP RUNNING BACKWARDS
That's a facemask
NO FACEMASK WHAT THE SHIT
Anyone watching the coaches broadcast?  Mike Gundy's mullet is looking luxurious 
Wow Swift wtf
Bruh you went the wrong way
I get that Tua is the better passer but this is not the time to just throw the kid in. 
/r/wholesomememes
What a dumb playcall and a dumb decision to run backwards 
Facemask! WTF?
YOU'RE GOINGTHE WRONGWAY
Facemask all day there???
No face mask?
i thought they had his facemask
BUGGS?? lol
Tide defender JUUUUUST stopped himself from a face mask.
Facemask?
Facemask...?
ESPN stream lag is insane. Going a different route. 
Y'all remember when the Bama offense showed up at halftime and the Tide won the Bourbon bowl? 
This is all Auburn's fault
Hurts is not the kind of QB who is going to dig you out of a hole
you would think big 10 refs would do their best to prevent the sec from winning
Reports of Bellichick leaving New England and Saban is going delusional after 1 bad half? Football as we know it is taking a huge left turn
Why is the WatchESPN stream so terrible, keeps buffering every 5 seconds for me.
Michel doesn't get enough snaps. He's by far the best back it's not even close.
Hey
whoooosh
wtf, no flag for facemask?
o no, what iz youz doin baby?
Never say never.Uh...over.
Getting the ball at Georgia's 30 vs getting the ball in the red zone. Yeah, pretty much the same.
Me and Georgia have something in common. Both our Chubbs are going nowhere 
Really? No facemask?
Facemask??
Face mask missed
WHAT THE FUCK THEY CALL A WRONG OFFSIDE BUT NOT THE MOST OBVIOUS FACEMASK IN NCAA HISTORY
Incoming 3rd and long conversion 
Did they NOT call a facemask???
Are you watching via AppleTv? If so, the ESPN alternate streams are working great. 
wut m8
Would you want to play there? They don't let their QBs showcase themselves. 
Pretty blatant facemask right in front of the ref. Jesus Christ
Face mask
I hope this Bama fan was trollinghttp://www.nydailynews.com/sports/college/alabama-fan-concerned-language-barrier-hawaiian-qb-article-1.3493395
WTF
Defense, please keep us in this
UH facemask
Fuck bama amirite
Clearly a facemask... the fuck is going on here, refs???
I hope that's not the case. Alabama hasn't done anything close to "winning the war" yet this year.
YES! But Hurts has proven himself for 2 years and has more big game experience than anyone. You don't pull your starting QB out of panic!
No facemask?
What an IDIOT
God damn refs use a condom when you fuck us
Blatant facemask 
#REFBALL
Does Gump still have eligibility left?
REFBALL
Wow, no facemask
Boy, no face mask? Awful
What the fuck was that 
oh nice one refs
mask face?
CALL THE FACEMASK REFS. COME ON.
That's two missed calls already
[deleted]
gotta run North South Baby
face mask. 
lmao blatant facemask.
Refs not calling shit on Bama 
lol @ bama putting in a true freshman at QB, like that will ever work
Already National Champions, what are you on about?
True haha, but if this is what has to happen, Bama losing and their fan's salty tears are a good consolation prize.
I GET IT TOO NOW, THANKS
Maskface?
Missed face mask now, big 10 get your shit together
FUCK these refs
hahaha B1G refs
another one. fuck these refs 
How in the world did they not see that 
Um... face mask?
WHAT THE FUCK WHERE'S THE FACEMASK 
Rigged tbh
Hmm I don't know, does it have good commercials?
missed facemask call there
These refs are fucking terrible
Jesus Christ, that was blatant.
Does Bama's defense have a better chance of scoring than Bama's offense?
DIRTY
Pretty sure it's just a benching. Showed him right on the line by Saban ready to go in.
I am doing so.
You telling me it''s a bad thing to have some sense of loyalty?
Bama getting away with everything now
wtf and no face mask?
??????? 
Facemask
If they go to commercial during an injury, they should put that ad revenue in a players fund.
Refs are starting to get bama back in it
Refs get paid off by Bama at halftime?
Why would you run backwards? Who do you think you? Devin Hester?
What the fuck refs?
id say a slightly less charming kevin malone
Georgia getting hosed
how do you miss that facemask lmao
lol these refs
You can't plan for the backup. Mind games boss man
I'm not going to link in case that's a bannable offense, but a rule of thumb is you can add "streams" to any sports subreddit and get plenty of good streams
Um big time face mask. That's 2 blown calls by the refs.
Facemask??
Why the fuck would you go backwards like that?  Coaches ignore that in teaching players not to do that a little too much for my liking.
Rigged.
THATS A FACEMASK
Refs trying to keep Bama in this. 
Alright, that's an enormous missed call. 
Nice call refs
Swift was not holding on to that ball wisely.
Even I saw the facemask from TV. Wtf refs 
wrong way wrong way wrong way!
My dog in this fight is watching Alabama go down in flames.
This whole 4 team playoff was a farce.
Camera angle was slightly off the line on the replay so I wasn't sure. Looked at it again and yeah he was clearly on.
Oh ok let's just let that facemask go uncalled. Two blown calls in 3 plays. 
aLaBaMa cLeArLY sHoULdVe mAdE tHe PlAyOfF oVeR UCF
Yeah. It's basically a requirement for a BXII team to win their conference to even get a look (even OU most of the time). If you're not OU/TX I dont think any BXII team will get in unless they go undefeated.
but +5 yards also...
I'm the greatest
Fuck these refs
Facemask? No? Anyone? Ok.
Wtf is this officiating.
LOL WHAT IS THIS REF CREW
Def face mask there
R I G G E D
Ok refs wtf.
LMAO how do they miss that Facemask...
Holy fuck our refs suck
Oh the refs screwed us again? Shocking. 
How the fuck is that not a facemask? 
not running backwards is like rule number one of running the ball...
Time for refs love Bama comments 
If the rule is changed, the QB knows that it's not really a 'free play,' and you would expect the behavior of the QB to change, no? They probably wouldn't blindly take shots down the field if there's a chance it could stand as an INT.
Refs bending over for Bama again
FACEMASK!!
What a bad decision there. What the hell
Uh facemask?
Face mask to a horse collar...
Wow, I'm not even watching the game and I come into the GDT and this is the first thing I see holy shit perfect.  I rant about this and get downvoted all the time.
Refs just realizing Bama is down
THESE REFS ARE BLIND
Come on Big Ten refs, you're better than this 
That's why you don't run southeast/southwest. 
Hmm B1G refs missed that one
Is it a running into the kicker penalty if the kick gets blocked by someone other than the guy who hit the Punter?Certainly looked like he hit the Punter and the ball was kicked into another player (possibly even a Bama player). Regardless false start makes anything that happened moot (refs gave Bama 10 yards but the block was never an option for uga to choose)
I think Saban's pact doesn't allow that.
HOW DO YOU MISS THAT EGREGIOUS OF A FACEMASK HOLY FUCK 
How the fuck is bama getting away with these penalties 
Face mask and horse collar wtf refs
Maria Taylor is hot!
I can''t believe he did that. The moment he went with another guy is the moment he inevitably lost this game. The first time I have ever wondered wtf Nick Saban was thinking 
Uh, that's a clear facemask.
If the false start had been called the play would have been blown dead right?
We're entering refball territory
"Blimp worthy" to me is GY catching a fat drunk running on the field.
Jesus Georgia gettin jobbed!
Refs still in locker room.
wow refs really want Bama back in this 
SEC BIAS!!
Okay refs, how much did you get paid?
What conference are these refs from?
He would've been a Duck if Helf had even tried. Wanted to play for us since he was a kid.
Jesus Christ these refs are repping Bama tonight.
These officials suck donkey dick.
Damn the face mask
Damn. I'm not saying the fix is in but....
This isnt madden
SCLSU Mud dogs
No kidding. I get that the offense hasn't looked well, but yikes. It's a 13 point game still
THE FIX IS IN
Georgia getting annihilated by the refs so far
WowHuge missed call
He got done dirty? He hasn't done shit in big games since he got ere our offense is extremely one demensional with him on the field 
Ref ball. 
It was cool the first 12 times I saw it.
Easy facemask call missed. Wut.
UGA getting screwed on these calls
Fuck these refs
These refs want to keep it close
These refs are really working for Bama
wtf are these runs
Lol face mask and horse collar
ffs b1grefs
JT Barrett syndrome. 
RIGGED
uhhh facemask?
#FUCK YOU REFS 
Add on another bullshit dirty play by Alabama 
Refs trying to save u bama
So when does the winner of this game play UCF?
What station is the coaches broadcast?
H my god I didn't know this was B1G. I'm sorry
*ahem*#FUCK THE REFS
How is that not a facemask? Georgia is getting fucked on calls right now.
Refs tryna keep Bama in it smh
refs doing all they can to get bama back in this game lol 
Refs trying to get Bama back into the game.
Refs are ass!!!!
Hmmm, I wonder how they could miss all these obvious calls on 'Bama.
yeah refs missed that
Sounds so weird to say but I almost feel sorry for bamas defense, they work so hard but the offense throws it away
The conference championship is effectively useless. It's just an extra game and has no extra bearing on when a team goes to the CFP or not. If I were a conference I'd just remove it altogether, it only hurts the chances for a CFP bid
Hurts wasn''t THAT bad. It''s almost like he didn''t have good adjustments so he''s throwing a Hail Mary. 
Fuck that no call!
More bullshit for Bama
refs are gonna bring bama back in this 
Well good game bama
Lol @ refs
Confirmed. I was that guy at prom. 
Refs trying to keep Bama in this?
[sigh](https://images.roadtrafficsigns.com/img/lg/X/wrong-way-sign-x-r5-1a.png)
Can you share more on this? I dont see Jalen play often, but he genuinely seems like a good guy. Maybe its the always calm demeanor. Makes me root for him to do well
Insane. 
We can hope
At least until Alabama punts again 
Unbelievable missed calls
Refs blowing Bama as is tradition 
wow refs arent even trying to pretend 
Two huge calls go Bama''s way.  Absolute bullshit.
No face mask? bullshit
If ESPN is so worried about cord cutters, why did they apparently put a drunk blind monkey in charge of their streaming department?
Where was that facemask call?
Not calling anything against bama 
bullshit calls would go Bama's way
Alabama is getting lucky with these calls
When he spun back around ref saw him holding only jersey I guess 
Missed face mask but I'll take it
Is the game full screen though?
Fuck you refs and fuck you bama
Of course Alabama gets away with a face mask. Disgusting. 
Loser of this game gets Mike Stoops!
Not so swift there, Swift. 
Refs told to keep it close?
Wtf refs, 2 calls for Bama
Lol I''m colorblind and I mistook the refs crimson and white stripes for the regular black and white 
what the fuck is this officiating?
Yes 
It's bama.
What happened? Didn't Georgia still get the ball? I turned away for one moment and missed something t big apparently
Stupid fucking officials
Wow Georgia is getting unprecedentedly fucked by the refs this half
Because this game is taking forever, I'd like to remind everyone that Marchand is a rat faced bastard/u/skt_phoenix1 this one's for you
I love Swift... But he needs to stop fucking running the opposite way. 
Hat a terrible fucking drive.
Yes.
The game would last forever if that happened.
Refs are trying to keep Bama in this game. 
Wow these refs trying to fuck us out of this win
These refs are shit
Jesus, how do you miss that as a ref?! Wtf!
I don't mind the miss on that face mask honestly. But that fucking blocked punt......
Fuck these refs 
These refs needs to wake the fuck up. 
Welcome to the Big Ten CFB bros
FUCKING BULLSHIT THAT WAS A FACEMASK
Fucking garbage Refs. 
Refs holy fuck
referees for alabama MVP
wellp, you wanted Tua. We're getting Tua. Let's ride. 
Refs gotta try and keep Bama in it
Did they replace the refs?
Oh god it's happening, isn't it? 
Don't be bitter after losing to UCF.  The conference championships are stupid and should be a thing of the past.  Georgia was clearly the best team in the SEC, the match ups and title game just didn't line up that way.   They would smoke you guys 9/10 times. 
Giving the game to Bama now
Fuck the refs
God damn Alabama could come out and sucker punch Fromm after a play and the refs would miss it. 
Nice to know who the refs are going for 
What a fucking embarrassment.
Looks like Bama has finally gotten off the bus
big momentum swing
Facemask
I said potentially, in my defense 
Bama mvp? Refs.
Oh is this where Georgia has to play Bama and Refs at the same time?
Not like this
THE FIX IS FUCKING IN FELLAS
Refball 
How do you miss that face mask?
Yikes B1G refs 
Poor weak alabama needs the refs help to stay in the game
Refs gonna give this game back to Bama. 
Is the fix in?
3 calls in the first 3 min to go Bama's wayI'M SHOCKED!
Bama aren't falling for the 3rd and 20 draw play anymore.
these refs in bamas pockets rn holy
Holy fuck officials. 
Jesus refs wtf? 
Facemask. Will never hear from some of the more insufferable dawg fans if we come back.
I was gonna say that looked like a facemask...
No facemask but definitely an offside /s
Guess his hand getting the jersey made the refs think it just looked like a facemask? Bad miss though
RRRREEEEEEEEEE
Nah, we won the Sugar Bowl. That's at least something.
Where the facemask call?!
lol facemask fuck bama
Ref crew not having a great time of it. Yikes.
Wow Bama realized that the checks have to go to the Big 10. That halftime paid off. 
So I literally have no care for this game, but I decided to put on the coaches version. This is so much more entertaining. 
FUCK THE REFS
Yes, and flair up.
I prefer it. For the most part they''re letting the boys play.
Fuck WatchESPN
B1G refs biased towards Bama? 
Refs just bent us over and fucked us in the ass
Kirk calls such a fair game. 
Refs doing everything they can to save ESPN's Alabama narrative lol 
... and against the SEC.
WHY ISN'T THIS SHIT REVIEWABLE???
FUCK THE REFS
Bama is getting their asses beat and refs trying to control it. 
These refs are some god damned trash lol 
Everyone ready for an Alabama punt?
Saban sacrificed a virgin at halftime 
Refs trying so hard to get Bama back in the game its not even subtle.
This game is rigged for Alabama and they''re still blowing it. They definitely deserved to make the playoff
Refs want Alabama back in this game so bad it's embarrassing
Yes
Holy fuck refs how do you miss that even my mom said something 
Holy shit the refs are favoring Bama so hard. First the blocked punt and now this. 
UGA getting fucked so far in second half
Facemask and Horsecollar missed in one play
NFL must have loaned them some refs for the game
Refs are really missing these calls today
I literally can't even
It's good to know the refs are with us tonight
Thanks refs for screwing us out of 7 points 
Consider that payback for no-calling the false start on the punt
Refs too busy going down on Saban.
They forgot to show up. Just like Bama''s offense.  
False start negates the block too my dude. 
Dawgs are owed some makeup calls.....
Where the ACC refs when we need them?
I can see why he didnt call that, but it was a facemask 
facemask.
B one G refs, at least it's not PAC12
Fucking facemask. Holy shit.
Fuck you refs
Jesus these refs
B1G crew has been unimpressive so far. Should have gotten the ACC crew from the Rose Bowl.
Did he just spin him by the face mask? Lol
Refs trying to keep bama in it.
Bama gettin all the breaks.
Jesus Christ referees, at least try to make it look by accident
Oh fuck the refs have money on the game
Which QB will come on the field?!
Refs love Alabama
damn bama getting calls like the packers do in the nfl
That was clearly a facemask wtf
H8 H8 H8 H8
These refs gonna call ANY of Bama's penalties?
Calls don''t matter, games over
It's honestly impressive to me that a multi-million dollar company can create and maintain  a service as awful as WatchESPN. Bravo for being able to keep this going for so long
B1G refs are mad that their conference was left out.
Fuck these refs.  
dont do this shit refs
Can't you actually manually set the video quality?
Horse collar is from behind.
Looks like they got these refs from the NFL training program
Shit like this always makes me wonder who the fuck is paying the refs.
These refs are awful. Fuckin Bama man 
So the refs want Alabama to win, huh? That's two HUGE missed calls by the officials to get them the ball back.
Is it just me, or does Alabama seem less enthused about this game than Georgia. 
Guys Im not gonna lie...I read this thread since Im streaming and bet a friend Fromm would throw an interception on the next play in the first quarter and he obviously did.....I wanted to confess here but I''m $10 richer!!! Thanks Reddit!!!!
Stupid fucking missed calls gonna cause a momentum shift 
These refs suck
It's super bowl 40 all over again 
THAT'S my defense!
stop it you
Yes
They swapped out Big ten refs for Pac 12 refs at halftime, seems like. 
Refs doing their best to help Bama get back in it.
Big 10 refs doin us proud
Not to worry, Dawgs, all Michigan fans have your back when shitting on this specific reffing crew.
"He wants his team to focus on the next 30 minutes."What the fuck else would they focus on?
What''s up with that Kentucky SEC champ prediction thread? Is that still possible?
FACEMARK BRO
Lmao these referees are awful. 
no shit
These refs are ass!
FACEMASK
Lol refs trying to fix the game for Bama after Saban threatened their lives at half.
And now they follow up that shit call on the punt by not calling the most obvious face mask of the century
Kinda looked like a facemask
Fire the refs
B1G refs pissed they got left out of the playoffs
Georgia just wasted all of that momentum 
I don't want to make excuses but Alabama just doesn't come to play when they need to. They have great players, great coaches, great everything but they just seem really fucking dumb when they need to play smart. I think if Alabama came to play, they would be the best team in the nation, no doubts but they just shit the bed over and over again.
I don't even care about this game and I am ANGRY about those two huge no-calls by the refs
You were doing so well. WTF refs. That was a blatant facemask.
biased ass refs
Jesus Christ officials blowing this half.  WTF
Holy face mask Batman 
I'll never understand how officials miss face masks. Why are you looking at something other than the ball carrier
what does he have to lose. Hurts is garbage and not going to come back from a 12 point deficient 
Either BAMA or the Committee
Must be the refs from the 2014 Duke/Wisconsin game 
Lol no face mask or horsecollar?
Phantom offsides followed by "Huh? What facemask? Where?"
Refs got Bama -4 and it shows...
should have run michel on 3rd and a mile. been working all night
Rabble rabble rabble
Did they replace B1G refs at halftime with Pac-12 refs?
It was a bad matchup, yes.
REFS FOR ALABAMA MVP
refs were instructed to keep bama in this game lolembarrassing tbh
Zebras get drunk at halftime or something? 
Where's the face mask.
More trying to save Bama. Fucking refs
Yes and the block would not have mattered. Just five more yards back that would likely lead to a fair catch punt that would negate the huge return UGA had. No point in getting mad
*Looks at Secondary flair*You aren''t gonna listen to reason, are you? 
2 HUGE missed calls trying to keep Alabama in the game. Is this the NBA?
Two blown calls
Come on Georgia....just 8 more points....I'm almost.....there
Graesping the fassmusk.
If it takes the refs for UGA to lose I'm all for it.
ESPN must have told the refs to make this game competitive.
Bama got away with two big calls there. 
How do you miss that facemask????
Bama getting Bama calls smh
Yes
Even for Helf that makes no sense. Really a shame.
Bama getting away with lots of no calls here
fuck the refs
I'd love to see r/CFB ref a game and see people shit on them.
What the fuck is this reffing...that is the most blatent facemask I have ever seen.
So are we not calling facemasks or?
What conference are these refs from? 
This is how they've looked all year from what I've been able to watch. Still surprised about the playoff bid and I'm just happy Tua is in. 
Haha, that is why I'm watching the coach film room! Are they in love with Alabama?
ESPN told the refs to drag this shit out for more commercials.
Are these pac12 refs? Genuinely curiousEdit: wow thank you all they are B1G refs apparently!
PAC-12 refs are in this bitch 
Where the FUCK is the facemask 
We know... We know
three Bama guys false start: offsides for UGASwift gets swung around by his facemask: hmm? what flag?these refs were pretty solid in the first half, dunno what's up all of a sudden
Fuck the refs.
GET OFF YOUR KNEES REF YOU'RE BLOWING THE GAME
Holy fuck 'bama, how much did you pay the refs?
It's hard for the refs to blow the SEC team when both teams are from the SEC.
Dear Dawgs. <-- Endzone is that way.
Not even a replay of the obvious facemask, huh?
If a ref were able to catch that in real time, he should become a super hero with eyesight based superpowers.
Per usual
And that's a clip on the return.
Bama lucky again. 
Definitely a face mask...
Yeah,, read Sabans biography. Dr Evans or whatever that Michigan state guys name was talking about how relief impacts games, they felt relief after Clemson and its showing now
$aban keep$ getting tho$e break$ 
I see the refs got my Bitcoin payment.
Dawgs should be kicking a FG at worst right now. 
How'd they miss that....
This officiating is fucking shameful. Saban yelled at the refs at halftime to step their game up or they wont be allowed to jerk him off.
ZEBRAS YOU AWAKE FAM?! 
As long as it isn't Michigan
That was an easy face mask
Guess Saban told the refs at half time to quit making calls against him. What the fuck? 
I hope Kirby is telling Swift to get North and South and quit being fancy. He did the same thing in the Rose Bowl.
god two missed facemasks this game... ugh
3rd and 100.
A false start would have invalidated the block too.  Its not a declineable penalty because its presnap.
The fix is in!
refs doing everything they can to keep bama in this
Refs trying their hardest for Alabama.
[deleted]
 I hope Tua plays the rest of the game 
It was too much going on for me, but I enjoyed it in small doses.
I''m not one for conspiracy theories but I''ve got my tin foil hat on after that no call
As is tradition. 
 Facemask
Who decided running backwards against Bama was good?Refs wearing Crimson underwear
Refs gotta make this game interesting. We dont want people turning off the TV and not seeing the same 4 ads every break. 
Dog shit refs 
If I was drinking per penalty called on AL I would still be sober
I think some the Alabama trustees slipped the refs some $50's.  
Lol that was a flag 
1 missed call and everyone already saying the refs are paid smh
FIX IS IN
Fucking horse shit. Bama getting saved by the refs again. 
Did Bama put new refs in at halftime as well? Holy fuck.
Refs obviously rigging it for Bama now. Refs need to do better at hiding it.
Yep, but a ten yard swing from where they punted
REFS FOR ALABAMA MVP
Imagine grabbing the face mask and the horse collar without being called on it
Refs tryna ask for a raise from Saban after the game
BamaMoneyBagsRef dot gif
SEC doesnt want Saban to be exposed for the trash coach he is so they pay off the refs 
The fix is in boys. Bama can't lose when the refs are on their side.
The one in stripes? Yeah, not too bad
Bullshit ass calls benefiting bama. Their fans will crawl out from under the cabinets soon enough. 
Refs doing their best to keep Bama in the game as usual 
Refs getting bama back in the game.
two major misses 
Yeaaaah that was a face mask. Saban might be holding the refs family hostage 
I''m not even in the same state and I could tell that was a face mask 
Pretty standard reffing 
Yeah 
Pretty sure he was trolling, but the replies were fucking hilarious.
That was a hard ass facemask too
Someone told the refs to "make it a game" for sure..
How the hell did they miss that? 
wow fuck off refs
refs are ridiculous 
Refs high key trying to get Bama back in this 
Yep.
Hell ya 
How do you miss that facemask?
That's okay. We will beat Bama and the Crew.
Water sucks! It really really sucks!
It's gonna suck if we turn around and barely win this after those two calls
This is the paradox, people don't want refs deciding the game but get super pissed when refs miss calls (big or small)
I'm just here so I don't get fined
I don''t think running on 3rd and long works as well if you always do it. 
>THAT'S my refs!
OMG THERES A REF STANDING THERE WATCHING THE FACEMASK LOL
THEY CHEATIN PAWLLL
[deleted]
I''m glad our runners are daring enough to try and cut back.
Took a little while for the check to clear. 
After beating the #1 team by 18
Official stared that down. 
Botched the offsides, then no facemask? What's going on here....
B1G refs after dark.
Refs should just wear Bama jerseys
big 10
what took you so long
Getting away with personal fouls, yeah! 
Refs keeping Bama in
Fuck the refs
Big 10 Refs calling a great game for them though....
Pac12 refs in disguise
FYI false start is a dead ball penalty also negating the block. 
Well if the meteor fails to win I guess shitty refs making it controversial is the next best thing.
Shit, I still got 9 out of 24 beers left
It has been a frustrating season seeing us stay in games and win games based on our defense while Hurts consistently under performs.
B1G 
Big 10
Those BIG 10 refs doing a great job.
And then no block in the back call on the punt?
Someone is trying to help Bama... got the call from Vegas
Bah gawd that''s Tua''s music!
He has so many
Uh, flag on bama?
Refball
I'm never one to say a game is "rigged" but this officiating is...suspicious...in favor of one specific team 
Gotta keep it interesting I guess
Big 10 I think
or false starts on punts
No, only for a second or so
 The ref was standing right the fuck there
When the refs have done more for your team than the QB...
Commercial time! Yeha
u/legitocracy fight this guy
What's the difference?
THE REF WAS RIGHT THERE. Are you kidding me????
Never put a Bama game in the refs hands 
Dumb to run backwards but how did they miss that facemask?
B1G
Yes it''s Alabama''s defense, and the referees time to make something happen.
Bama has had zero turnovers in Natty games under Saban. I think we're due
God fucking damnit
Jesus refs trying to keep Bama in it
$$$ BAMA $$$
And missed a block in the back...these refs are on a mission 
The ref was right there
Borderline block in the back on that return too... Yeesh.
Well... two
These B1G refs are blowing Alabama... or the game
Shitty officiating benefitting Alabama?I for one am shocked.
I didn't see a facemask - Crazy Eyes
Anyone think Gallman has a shot to start next year for NYG? 
They have been great up to this qtr.
and they're still losing lol
They didn''t. They know what they''re doing
Alabama gets gifted spot in play offGets gifted do over on a punt they fucked upGets a no call on an obvious face mask Jesus, how many more extra breaks can they get?
Wonder if Tua comes out again
Disgraceful. 
Two
I swear my ESPN app lags every 3 seconds during play time but commercials are unsurprisingly smooth. Fuck 
Too much football intercepting my commercials. Good guy ESPN. 
The biggest part of the transition is realizing his Mahalo Rewards Card doesn't work in the continental US
Using a Roku, so... Not sure.
I saw the facemask from the zoomed out broadcast. How do you not see that from 5 yards away?
Blatant face mask - will NEVER get called on Bama. This is why America is pulling for the Dawgs.
That might be the most glaring back-to-back missed calls I've ever seen in college football. Raises some serious red flags.
Of course they aren't calling that on Bama
Georgia''s unis are sexy af
Well horsecollar is only if you take them down from the back. Face mask for sure missed.
What a considerate fan. When I was in Alabama, I couldn''t understand a word they say, was it English? Who knows.
Jesus these refs are fucking garbage.
T h e r e f sherefs
THE REFS ARE BIG 14. KEEP THAT IN MIND. 
Why would they run on 3rd & 21? It's not 3rd & 20... *sigh*
What does it matter? We are done. 
Shoulda been a block punt into a touch down. Shoulda been a facemask and first down. Nope punt. Thanks b1g refs!
These refs missed two obvious calls against Bama. The fix is in. 
Don''t artificially give them momentum zebras they are capable of getting it on their own
This officiating is straight up shameful. 
OKAY MAYBE I JUST FUCKING HATE BAMA BUT THESE CALLS ARE VERY SUSPECT TO ME IDK?
Yah that was a bit of a face mask. 
Clear face mask, saw it before the replay
Just tuned in here...what seems to be the issue for Alabama? Is Georgia's defense suffocating or is their offense playcalling/execution horrible?
Oh right, B1G officials. That makes sense.
B1G 10
HOLY SHIT THE REFS ARE FUCKING TERRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!
Tua getting the ball back. Let's see what he can do...
Yep, it''s in full swing
that poor, poor redditor
False start would still have resulted in redoing the punt.
Officials must have been told to make sure Bama gets back in the game 
Refs trying to keep Bama in the game wtf. 
No the official missed it because he is blind
Did we switch the Big Ten crew for a Pac 12 crew? Jesus. 
 You can't horse collar from the front.  
Blocked punt was onsides too
That would have been a facemask penalty if it was Aaron Rodgers.
My dog looked up from eating his ass to be disgusted by that no-call.
Alabama football Illuminati starting to influence this game just like the SECCG. 
Should we just get the officials ‘Bama caps?
So that's where the refs from the Titans/Chiefs game went to after that one.  
These refs are going full Bama rn. 
Even the refs suck in the B1G
Lol blatant facemask in front of the ref and still didn't get called.
What is this you speak of? 
You can''t talk man...
Refs are fucking Georgia HARD
The refs are screwing Georgia
Horrible no call there. Pretty blatant facemask
I'm pissed about that facemask no call
n1 bullshit
Check cleared
Big ten 
Well at least the Rose Bowl officiating was good. This is a dumpster fire.
The checks must've just cleared.
So which QB comes out now?
Block in the back missed there too
These refs are hosing the Bulldogs. 
Are we watching the same game? 
RYAN LEAF WON YOUR LAST ROSE BOWL
Big ten refs always suck. Now you feel our pain 
As good as the officials were in the first half, that's how bad they are now. Can't have Cash Cow, I mean Bama, get blown out on national TV now, can we?
How do you miss that facemask tho
Bama no calls.They just mean more. 
False Stsrt called as offsides (to ne fair the false start should've negated the block anyway).Then a missed Facemask.Refs really trying to get Bama back in the game I guess....
It's not a good idea to try and get cute with Alabama. Don't go trying to change the game plan too much.
B1G
That was not offsides
Lol so it would seem 
B1G
That's horrible. Ref was right there too 
No facemask, offsides, and I thought I saw a block in the back on the punt return. 
Gotta get Bama back into the game somehow... 
Poor cheese pizza lies untouched : (
Incoming /r/legaladvice posts from Alabamians wanting to know if they can sue for emotional damages.
Some coaches get too attached to their QBs and let it cloud their judgment. 
She went to my high school! Awesome person.
She's tall as fuck too. 
That's not a paradox, that's consistency. 
Autocorrect. Changed it right after 
These refs are from the Mr Magoo School of Officiating
I guess the refs got their checks from Saban at halftime.
Nick Sabin with the Mutant League Football style ref payoff at the half.
what are these piece of shit refs even doing out there
That was a block in the back on that return, too.
lol we'll see if that's worth shit in the 4th quarter!
Big Ten
That was 2 in 4 plays
I just hope not for this game. To hell with georgia
how do you miss facemasks?  One of the easiest calls.
Time to watch Bama go 3 and out!
These commercials wth fake sports teams and speeches are so fucking lame 
If you make the fucking tackle and don''t let him be shifty back there, you don''t even have the opportunity for that missed face mask. Jesus Christ just fucking tackle.
with a damn finger... calm down
liquor
Oh look a B1G official missed a facemask, that's neVeR HapPeNEd BefOrE.*PAC ref throws me out of the gamethread*
Anyone else miss the crystal ball?
He is literally dragging him down by his facemask, right in front of you. How do you not call that?
Ok refs we can at least TRY to be a little less bias towards Alabama.
Because you guys are playing *so much* better with Tua in Edit: why is it bad that I''m suggesting someone act in their own interest, exactly?
This is fucking bullshit 
Damn. Turns out Bama has a run def~~w~~ense. 
bruh we all saw it in real time
Jesus Christ refs
Jake Fromm gonna be Jalen Hurts screensaver all summer long
This is the first game I've ever cheered for Bama (money on it) and I already feel like I need to go sit in chlorine. 
2 big missed calls. Keep grinding UGA. 
[deleted]
Refs cost them 3 points and caused a 3 and out
Two blown penalty calls in a row
lmaoooo these refs throwing the game.
Calm down everyone. The refs are just trying to give us an exciting game!
I don't know why everyone is so upset. When you slow a play down and zoom in real close you can see all these minor infractions, but at live game speed I didn't see any facemask, and the offsides call looked correct too.EDIT: Enter downvotes because refs have to be perfect with x-ray vision, zoom-in, slow-mo eyes /s
No, they''re using hand signs for him. For the uninitiated: http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/college/alabama-fan-concerned-language-barrier-hawaiian-qb-article-1.3493395
Un-fucking believable.
Absolutely.
2 in a row bubba
What the fuck refs
I for one, am totally okay with the refs giving the game to Bama. No bias. 
Even worse to call it offsides then, right?
Looks like the officials are trying to get Bama back in this game lol. 
Refs have to keep Bama in the game so people will watch commercials.
$$$ 
No horse collar from the front. 
B1G
With the facemask no call! Nailed it
bruh I saw the head jerk from my couch. 
FACEMASK
Man, you Dawgs are getting screwed by these refs."Gotta keep this championship game close. Roll Tide." - Big 10 Refs.
JAKE: Yeah, can I have a dozen red roses please?SABAN: Oh, hi, Jake. I didn't know it was you.[grabs bouquet of roses]SABAN: Here you go.JAKE: That's me. How much is it?JAKE: Hi, doggy.SABAN: You're my favorite customer.
animal abuse, Dawgs getting fucked here man
Don''t want people tuning out in the 4th quarter.
Hurts has to be back in now
Horsecollar only applies from the back. But it was a facemask though.
Well, a horse-collar tackle is from behind.After the face mask, he had him at the front of the shoulder pad.
2 missed calls pretty much back to back.
Did you know you can fit 63 Earths inside Uranus?
Missed block in back too...
I've only seen 3rd quarter plays. 3 missed calls already. I guess they're B1G officials? Not surprising
Head jerked to the side and everything
Blindside block?
*finger mask
By missing the big calls they are deciding the game
2 now. False starts to an offisides and a facemask.
FUCKING STUPID ASS REFBALL. GOTTA KEEP IT CLOSE FOR THE COMMERCIAL REVENUE
#sabanout
Jfc.....Miss in the offside & miss on the facemaskWhat a fucking joke
Come on B1G refs, get it together 
Catch 22 for refs.
Big Ten Refs got NCAA memo.  Make Bama win.
Jesus ESPN, at least rotate your stupid commercials on the coaches broadcast.
FUCK BAMA 
On behalf of the Big Ten, we apologize
On that replay it was a facemask clear as day. 
stop fucking around refs, this is the National Title Game for pete sakes.
Well reffed game until that offsides and then the face mask. Let's gope this isn't the 2nd half norm
are these those New England refs?
Lol Herbstreit covering for the refs
nice facemask and offense
These refs starting to hose the game?First the false start on the punt, then the facemask.
I'm really late. Where are these officials from?*Thanks
Lol that block on the return was identical to a personal foul called in the jags playoff game
[deleted]
Well it should have been a false start
For real, those were some good refs last week
am i crazy for thinking its rigged? for bama. idk that halftime show and all the commercial BS makes it seem like they want to keep it close 
Could the refs please not taint this game. Please!
B1G refs currently doing their best PAC-12 refs impression
REFS GONNA BRING ALABAMA BACK AND LET THEM WIN
the refs are picking a bad time to swallow their whistles
Damn I thought the refs were doing a pretty good job in the first half. What happened?
why would that bama player try to make that block on the punt return?  he's behind the play and is just asking for a penalty.
Dawgs vs Bama (feat. The Refs)
Or Brady
Yo... I'm not proud of it... but I'll still take a win
REFS!Give me upvotes 
One TD here makes it a ballgame again
That''s an insult to drunk blind monkeys
That's how I knew it was a flag watching live.. he turns the head hard! Unbelievably bad.
its not a paradox. The refs arent deciding the game when making correct calls. The players decide the game.
Missing calls is deciding the game
no matter what, people hate refs
Two missed calls/wrong calls on consecutive drives
True!
Yes. It will. Because y''all won''t deserve it.
Refs missing calls IS refs deciding games
I'm first half officiating crew and I have DirectvI'm second half officiating crew and I hit bullets with a hammer 
Good point. 
Blatant block in the back not called
C'mon B1G refs...
Vegas
i dont feel sorry for anyone at all at alabama
You shouldn''t be here, though 
Like 70%, good if you can have your TV on the game and it on computer
Is this really the best big10 crew? 
Saban drop the bags on the refs at half?
On mobile, can I still add a flair?
I fell for it hook line and sinker then lol
The viewers must be dropping. Better make this game closer.
cmon refs
Do they have one from Samoa?
I hope this horrific refereeing doesn't continue, cause this is some bullshit. 
B1G refs..
Turned his entire head around grabbing on the facemask...easiest call on the field to make.
Bama got lucky as fuck.
Yeah, bad call there. But it was more that the ref couldn't see it than that this game is rigged.
Comon refs, don't act like NFL refs and don't fix the game.
UGA vs bama and the refs seems real fucking fair
Can''t review that penalty
Facemask. 
Direct tv can lick my butthole, but at least they''re not Comcast.
People are saying that Saban paid the refs or whatever but IMO I think a blowout in the *FAKE* Natty on national television is bad for business, and the refs know that. Or maybe I'm just too cynical. 
Welcome to B1G officiating for ya...
REFS FOR ALABAMA MVP
I mean idk if you can say it would be a touchdown but at least a FG attempt
Yeah but the Natty is not the time to pull that.
Oh god I tried sorting the comments by live. I had a fucking seizure.
I'm blind, i'm deaf, i wanna be a ref.
NCAA 2005 Update: LSU got a 1st down but punted on the next series so it's 1st and 10 Gators at my own 21 yard line with 51 seconds left in the 3rd with the score 11-0 Gators 
Tua was the heir that was promised, a fucking shame Helf did absolutely nothing to land him :(
We warned you about this referee crew!
what if i told you *missing* a call is identical to "the ref deciding the game?"
Missing calls is going towards deciding the game though
But they're twitchy for really bad offsides calls but missing blatant face masks. Nobody's innocent here.
Man Refs are now helping Bama get back into the game. That's a couple of penalties they didn't call. 
Lol this game is gonna take 5-6 hours
Has anyone here ever tried Gatorade with cereal?
Kirby sure is vocal on the sidelines I bet he''s a joy to play for
Extremely interesting flair sir/maam
ESPN glad these refs are keeping viewers tuned in.
This officiating is an embarrassment.
WHEW tell me how you guys REALLY feel about Bama 
TV is crazy
Can someone give me a definitive answer? Was he offsides on the punt or nah? Hard to see in this bar lol If he was that's an massively unfair swing against Ga
GET OFF YOUR KNEES, REFS, YOU''RE BLOWING THE GAME
@TimBrando: Yeah this looks like a late October, early November SEC regular season game. All do respect it''s treatment by @espn has been outstanding, but the old saying lipstick on a pig? Goes only so far. There''s very little NATIONAL about this game. Committee is to blame. Big picture gone!
Well uh.... Refs ruining shit again man, cmon.
Two huge blown calls by refs.
Cause these B1G* refs really give a shit who wins this game. They just suck at reffing. 
Maria Taylor is a total babe
Looks like Gundy just wants to watch the game, but these guys are reviewing every angle
The false start? Probably because you could find a false start on almost every play if you slow it down enough.
And I thought ACC refs were bad.
#
I don''t think missing blatant calls at the beginning of the third quarter is what people mean when they say they don''t want refs deciding games 
That's deceitful, and I expect nothing better from a PSU fan.
Alright, who switched out the B1G refs at halftime for PAC12 refs?
That is two massive changes in yardage and possession that they just...missed.
B1G refs really fucking suck
There is a difference between “let them play” and missing clear procedural shit like a face mask or off sides. 
Except nearly everyone saw that in real time.
Me also thanks 
Defense shut them the fuck down so this botched ass reffing doesn't do anything 
Fuck these refs man. 
I feel like in a playoff game you can't miss a blatent call like that...
O'Korn would have had 3 touchdowns by now, right?
The refs and the announcers are basically fellating Alabama 
Yep B1G refs are super interested in us winning it's crazy. 
Right. UCF are my National champs
I gotta say, I love Kirby's intensity. He's ALWAYS coaching..pretty cool to see
I really hope Georgia gets a takeaway to make up for the horseshit officiating.
And then a block in the back no call, too?
Wait until your best offensive player is ejected for making contact with a ref. Then you can complain about bullshit calls.
How did they not see his whole head get turned around?
Alabama isn''t allowed to lose this game, didn''t hear the new NCAA rule for tonight?
B1G
I agree man..
When shit is obvious like 3 people flinching on the punt and a facemask then it's ok to bitch. 
Kirby was right. The game will be decided by special teams and penalties and special teams penalties. 
Refs would rather just ignore what they see everybody booing on the big screen than call an extra late penalty to do the right thing.
Refs calling favorably for bama? You don''t say
What the fuck how do not see the face mask? That's insane!
from 2017 to 2018 [REFFBALL INTENSIFIES]
Should have been a false start, replay 4th down.Right about the facemask, though. 
They need all the help they can get rn
Whatever helps you sleep at night. Just a bit surprising is all. Georgia is doing to you, what you did to LSU in 2012. How the turn tables.
uhh
Bama sucks. 
*make viewers stay for the 4th quarter
The lesson here is that fans will always be pissed at the refs no matter what.
I guess I have superpowers then
Another missed call.  Block in the back on Lorenzo Carter.  Alabama typical. 
These refs are edging on "let me fuck tou in the aorhole or the sjjdn dcke foab and grt really good Halloween  ght; lor...you know?
Bama is getting crushed and people are still bitching about the game being fixed. Lmao.
I paid him with the capital one app
B1G
I understand the calls but am upset
He's a terrible passer, but everyone knew that all year long. I feel like at this point you roll with what you've got, but maybe Tua can provide a spark
Ok so we're officially watching corruption in action? Cool. Cool cool cool. 
Refs trying to save Bama...
Nah. Tua man. 
Alabama's boosters are getting ready to pin Caretaker's murder on the refs
if bama wins this game, there is no god in this world
shit reffing is killing sports
LMAO the replay of the blatant facemask TEN YARDS AWAY FROM AN OFFICIAL STARING RIGHT AT IT and no call.
I mean if they called it correctly you still don't get the block so settle down
Ditto
They got good field position anyway so it is no big deal
I don't want to start the conspiracy, but is this point where Bama starts getting all the calls/no calls in order to get them back in the game?
RIGGED FOR BAMA
That Gatorade commercial is what the ESPN execs watch when they feel like they maybe have played too many commercials 
I don't want them to hand us a W we didn't earn, but they better get this game to OT somehow.
Big ten refs are worse 
There's a difference between things like PI or holding, which are up to the discretion of the refs and things like false starts and facemasks that are cut and dry.
They did smother Clemson
Winning
Welcome to Big Ten Officiating boys 
Lmao Bama had 2 targetings last year not called. Fuck bama
Y''all, the refs have no-called tons of things on both sides. They''re letting them play hard and not slowing down the game. They''re being fair to both sides by simply not calling shit. Stop bitching!
The "offside" on the punt looked wonky live, so that is kind of excusable. But there will never be a clearer facemask. 
Two huge blown calls by the refs in about two minutes.
Capital one commercials are great
TUA PLEASE GET US BACK IN THIS
KT Slayer just came on.
I just wanna see a great game so... LETS GO TUA
No, a foul is a foul.
For everyone complaining it was a false start, you are right but it doesn't matter.  False starts are presnap penalties and the block wouldn't have counted anyway since the play wasn't valid.
We got the Titans vs Chief's for the second half 
Eh, he looked offsides in real time, but holy christ when a players head twists like that it's always because of a facemask.  Only way to miss that is to be a bad ref.
They're B1G refs.
These are the refs you get to call the national championship game. Either they're bad at what they do or they're being lackadaisical in the biggest game of the year
Garbage Refs. They are blind as a bat I tell ya
Mark Richt on loan to have a word with the refs ;-)
Poor officiating in big games? No way 
No, they're just bigtenning so far
The refs are your only defense
Heads don't turn 90 degrees in football unless the facemask is being pulled...
Good job on the Alabama defense to stop Georgia. Referee really played well for them, excited to see what he'll do next. 
FUCK THESE WANNABE PAC12 REFS
Stop drinking the schadenfreude, cfb
~Khabib
Do you guys remember the Iron Bowl when Alabama got the chance to redo the play after a fumbled snap because they''re Alabama?Just wondering.
That was a super blatant face mask. The officials were doing pretty well in this game up to that point I thought. 
Dude that face mask was hard to see in real Time from their position. 
is there not a difference in a referee calling a penalty and a referee deciding a game...?
I had GA by 14 and homers murdered me this week.
Yeah, people already hate us enough.
Nah.
Lol right 
How bout that missed facemask call. Y'all got lucky. 
I mean, if we're just slinging random insults (this comment was injury related)...Peach Bowl. 
No. They can decline the penalty
how did the refs miss that??honestly.
Fucking refs, really?
Let's go Georgia. 
There's a difference between people hating whistleball and watching refs miss obvious calls.
Either way they would have just had to redo the punt. A 10 yard difference there isn't a huge deal...
Big 10
C'mon, Georgia fans.  You guys got a free inelligble receiver on your TD run. 
The refs decided they didn't want Bama's punt to be blocked.
Facemask penalties should also be challengeable -- both ways. I've seen defenders called for it who didn't touch it in the slightest.
Cry more lol 
The fix is in fact in. 
Big 10
Refs missed that call game over Bama wins 
Block in the back on the return as well. This is turning into WWE.
You actually believe that?
I DID NAHHHT
Refs decide the game WHEN they miss calls. It's not a paradox
Yeah I'll give you that 
I just don't see Bama not coming back.
There is a happy medium
psst it's B1G refs
Refs just changed it from Georgia ball inside Bama 25 to Alabama ball at the 50. Amazing
Saban told his team to just start cheating during halftime. 
I agree with you on the offsides, but he yanked his freaking head back dude 
Bama's defense struggling with being Bama's offense
Refs trying to get Bama back in this. 
I think it''s more his passing that isn''t up to standard, he''s a great runner but the primary role of a qb is to pass the ball and it gets frustrating at times.I''d also add that it isn''t just the first half it''s been a recurring issue 
Finger mask. Literally 1 finger in his face mask
Thanks baby I know you have my back
I wouldn't be cheering penalties as "Your Defense"
Yeah, they are starting to hit me now.  I had brats and nachos to keep my occupied first half but now I have to endure these damn things.
Woulda been a false start on the punt.  Face mask was bad
We all know the answer will be as many as it takes. 
I wish there was someone I could root for, but here I am... watching with tech grads though, so it might be rubbing off on me a bit. 
Christ that was bad.
Bama getting away with murder these drives lol
Damnit! Needed that call!
Just win by two touchdowns and it won't matter.
B1G
Nah I thought he timed it perfectly in real time too 
I just can't believe there were no adjustments that could be made with Hurts, but we will see.
Yes, made his head move. Crap, that's now I want the game to be played
People just want refs to enforce well established rules. Failing to do so s basically changing the rules of the game on the fly.
*3. Within the span of minutes
How do you honestly come up with Mona Lisa to sell a credit card?  Honestly wtf
Damn if UGA loses momentum here it''s completely on the refs. This is a shitshow.
Refs have changed so many games this season something has to change 
Because some people would rather have a 3 hour game with like 50 blown calls than a 3 hour 30 minute game with no blown calls.
I am downvoting the shit out of this comment!
It's big 10 lmao
BIG10...
You have a very dumb friend sir
You must be having a good night! 
I was surprised he got the job this season to be honest. Thought Tua stood a decent shot of getting it
refs, I'm going to need you to come in at QB for Bama-Saban and ESPN probably
I kind of like the kaleidoscope motif ESPN is using for the backgrounds.
Refs NEVER go by what they see on the JumboTron.
Yea that will totally suck
But muh team. 
Me Jar Jar Banks
WTF was with that assisted squat rack. No coach worth his salt would ever make his athletes use that abomination 
Let's celebrate that defensive stop with some commercials!
The punt block wouldn't stand. A false start stops play, backs Bama back 5 yards and re-kicks
Up until this point, this game has been officiated well.
I went through so many attempts at reading this until I arrived at "these refs fucking suck" but man was it a journey 
Also WatchESPN still sucks.
Refs to the rescue
Yes.
Fuckin'. Got. Em. Go Dawgs!
Thanks for giving the ref an excuse for missing the facemask, that makes everything ok now
Refs have given Bama more yards than they've earned. Fucking pathetic
Did anyone else notice the Vegas money bulge in refs pocket.
SAD
Pick play? 
2
Facemask
Big 10*
it is B1G 
Damn it I miss Taco Bell. 
Nothing irks me more then seeing every questionable call go Bama's way.We got the Tar Heel Rule in CBB.Bama Rule in CFB.
Bama gets 7 here, the chaos theory is written
They''re giving the losing team calls to keep you watching lol 
We're getting rekt by one so lets see what happens.
The refs are helping. Yes, it's like in Lord of the Rings when the eagles showed up. 
They called off sides when it wasn't
Here we go, here comes Bamas comeback...always happens after a big missed call 
Bama defensive MVPs = zebras
Not at all. In fact he got triggered by a false start. 
FEREEE
He grabbed and yanked his face mask. Ain't nothing ticky tack about it
3 no calls in a matter of a minute.
Gene Steratore should ref every major football and basketball game 
That was bullshit too. So is this
Missed the face mask then missed the block in the back. Oopsie!
didnt know big 10 loved bama so much...
Ref was too close?
so do it
They're Big 10 refs
You mean the obvious face mask?
#PAC12RefsAfterDark
Let me see one Bama fan in here mouthing off. Refball bullshit. 
Yeah, Alabama is such a huge tv and retail market that the NCAA has coordinated it's referees to cheat on our behalf. 
Yeah who wants a fair game?
Like the officials didn't let Georgia get away with a more blatant after the play facemask earlier in the game. 
If they called the punt block play right it would have been a false start.  So the end result was about the same.
The ref was trying to help him up though
I think he means the facemask.
Oooooooooooooooh imma get him. Ain't got no time for this kind of opinion
No one reads these comments. I just put a corndog up my ass
Bama's bagmen saw the refs during halftime
It is a good sign for UGA fans that Kirby is still focused on the team.Teams lose when a coach reacts to a series like that by yelling at the officials. Kirby looks like he is keeping a rational head and saying "I can't change what the officials are doing; I can change what my team is doing though."
Fuckin REFS 
H8H8H8H8H8H8H8H8H8H8H8H8H8H8H8H8H8H8H8H8H8H8H8H8H8H8H8H8H8H8H8H8H8H8H8H8H8H8H8H8H8H8H8H8H8H8H8H8H8H8H8H8H8H8H8H8H8H8H8H8H8H8H8H8H8H8H8H8H8H8H8H8H8H8H8H8H8H8H8H8H8H8H8H8H8H8H8H8H8H8H8H8H8H8H8H8H8H8H8H8H8H8H8H8H8H8H8H8.  THE REFS
Aw man that's pretty obvious
/r/CFB says every conference has terrible refs, so it doesn't even matter.
[deleted]
Got to keep it tight so we stay tuned to those commercials.
3 if you count that missed block in the back on the punt return just now.
no. But the movement from Bama would've blown the play dead.
No
yes she is
But that facemask...
I mean, the blocked punt was clean in my book, and I''m pretty neutral in my SEC hate
First of all, lol Kentucky.Second of all, our refs suck the worst of all the things that suck about B1G
It's almost like they should employ people to be able to see these infractions.
I just hope both teams are having fun!
[I feel for you, dawgs.](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Bt7ClWKCAAAe3P-.jpg)
In the officials defence. Herbstreit is right from his angle it looks like he was pulling the front of his jersey down.. still tho
JT was short 
Questionably offside/neutral zone, but pretty clear false start
Should''ve been offside on offense, two people moved.
Yours
There's a difference. That wasn't a close one. That's clearly a grab of the face mask. People don't like refs deciding the game when there's a PI late in the game that hadn't been called before. The refs changing their tendencies in crucial situations is what we don't like to see
That was indeed my point
Corner tackled receiver play*
Guys this is my fault. I gave the ref 20 bucks to keep the game interesting.
[deleted]
It isn't a conspiracy- alabama doesn't have penalties called on them. You can study years of footage and see this is true lol. The refs will bring Bama back and they will win by a field goal. Watched
Lmao Clemson had 2 picks last year not called. Fuck Clemson
Thanks.   Dealt with this shit all season. 
don't be so sure. they might be going back to Jalen
[deleted]
Saban paying off the refs
Yeah no one gives a fuck about your meaningless bowl game. 
Wtf did he want? Oklahoma and Clemson should''ve won then.
There is a difference between letting them play and missing egregious penalties and literally calling a ps4 alty on the wrong team.
It's a B1G ref squad. Not Big XII
Wut
i will eat a loaf of cat shit if bama comes back[This is about 45 minutes fresh. Will be nice and buttery when the game ends](https://m.imgur.com/a/6McpP)
That was a bad call. This game has also had bad calls. They are not mutually exclusive.
I wouldn't worry too much
I think you''re right. 
Get out. 
Bad offsides call on the blocked punt, missed facemask penalty, missed block in the back. UNBELIEVABLE
They're referees at the college level for a reason
[deleted]
This is far too familiar for me from The game in 2016
B1G
Bruh. Two misses in 4 plays.
Yeah, I mean fuck the rules right! /s
Everyone knows the big 10 refs watched the eclipse without the special glasses
The refs are get paid well from Bama's boosters
They're B1G not Big XII
No, we should have been destroyed by Clemson and the web of football would be right 
Bama getting away with murder these drives lol
They need to break out the trick plays. Where are the fake punts??
I'm sick to my stomach
They''re awesome.
We put in Tua to distract from us slipping the refs money 
If that''s the case, it''s not really working.
I think ESPN execs were giving the refs an ultimatum at halftime
been watching it for almost a full year now... 
I thought they were big 10 refs?
Two missed calls. Try to get that attention span up.
I'm not bitter, UCF showed up to play and played a hell of a game, Auburn didn't. Now back to the original topic. Alabama has an anemic offense and Saban has proven he struggles against high powered offenses. Who did Alabama beat during regular season to prove they were a top 4 team?
School WiFi being shit doesn''t help. 
Really? What a strange desicion.
B1G mistakes 
What''s it like to be blind? Idk I''m not a BIG ref.
Gotta love B1G refs. Especially this very "special" crew.
Not offsides.Facemask.Horse Collar.Shitty ball spots.B1G.
Taco Bell + Illuminati = WTF
We can't even get a first down man. 
[deleted]
I usually give refs a break but they seem especially bad
He had 1 finger on the facemask and a hold of the front pads. 5 yarder under the old rules, no call under the new.
Facemasking is very dangerous. You call that shit. I''m OK with most other no-calls but come on man. 
I don't, sorry, just watching it on TV.
I guess Saban was writing checks during the half..
Mama mia
Two huge blown calls, not some minor 5 yarder. 
The refs have been trying to win this game for Bama harder than every single Bama player.
Sad!
I thought they were B1G
I guess you''re not seeing the same calls 
I get that. But what makes you think a freshman who''s never been on this stage is better than a guy who has been?
Yes.  He advanced, held up, and proceeded again.  However his advancing was enough to infringe.Plus, advancing that far ahead of the snap will get flagged in real time every time and no sane person would expect otherwise.  Not reviewable and better for the game that it isn't.
finebaum's show might be civil war levels tomorrow if alabama wins a close one after those questionable calls/missed calls
What are you drinking to start the second half? 
I don't think the refs are calling this in favor of Alabama, that would imply Big XII refs are competent.
Are we gonna act like Georgia hasn't been holding all game?But wait, Bama had a face mask?Idk who to rant about. I'm bipolar tonight
The big 10 refs are so typically Midwest.  Absolutely rational and polite, but too slow to catch the SEC fouls in real time.  See my flair.  I'm pro Big 10.
Why?  He is inline and watching the ball.  It isn''t too difficult to see if someone jumps before the ball is snapped.
Some might place part of the blame on Clemson and Oklahoma. 
What? Did you start at noon as instructed?
I thought they were B1G
Show me where they missed as obvious of a penalty as that on UGA
2 missed calls 
Oh man I hate it when that happens.
I saw false start too, but to be fair if it was a false start then nothing changed. They still got good field position.
Espn news they have a bunch of college coaches watching and commenting on the game. I even like the view theyre showing. Its much farther out and shows the entire play.
These refs are making me fussy
Bama bros. I want to cheer for you because Dynasty.  But damnit the refs make it difficult.
First the wrong call on the offside and then that blatant facemask missed...Cool. Seems legit.
Are they trying to make this a close game.
Tbf he said its “Not just the QB” 
Espn told them to keep it a close game
8 T E A M P L A Y O F FTEA  MPLAYOFF
B1g 
4 minutes into the half and the refs blew an offsides  that would've given UGA the ball at the 20 and a facemask that would've given UGA a first down.
Refs need to have that same blindness when UGA facemasks
Alright, back from my beer run. I miss anything important?
Yes, the B1G refs are totally in the tank for Bama. Or maybe they just suck?
It should have been a false start which would have stopped the block. The face mask was tough to see
“Shit can''t have it look like Alabama doesn''t belong in the playoffs”
And they ruined our season! /s
Face mask?
[deleted]
What's wrong with Bama?
Two easily game changing calls within like 120 seconds of game time
It wasn't egregious but face mask is meant to be called for player safety. I saw it in real time as obvious and less egregious on slo mo
He's saying the play should have been blown dead with the false start
That was a blatantly obvious face mask. Where the the officials from the Rose Bowl??
Corruption? Really?
#PAC12AFTERDARK BABY!!!
Dilly dilly 
no Bama actually jumped
They were pretty good in the Rose Bowl
The neutral zone is the length of the ball, not a full yard.
As a Bama fan, christ on a bike. The refs not calling that facemask (and horse collar) was absolute trash. I'm sorry guys. Nobody deserves to be played like that
Georgia really needed to score more than 13 to have a good enough cushion for the rigging that we all knew was coming in the second half.
Nice
We know.
It was blatant on slo-now replay from the perfect camera. From where the ref was in real time it wasn''t so obvious. 
To the refs, yeah.
No he wasn't offsides but should've been a false start on bama so it would have been a dead ball anyway 
Not offside, but 2 or 3 Bama players also moved before the snap, so the correct call was false start.
Are you bringing logic to the SEC? 
Rant begin.Don't get on Twitter right now. Apparently if you dislike the Kendrick halftime show you are a racist. Even if you like Kendrick. And apparently all of the Southeast is shitting our pants because black people on TV. Believe it or not world, but we are watching a football game with the majority of players being black, one of the quarterbacks is black, but yeah we are ALLL freaking out because of a halftime show and a movie preview. Whatever makes you happy morons.Rant over.
TUA = THE UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA
I don't think the facemask was much of a yank as a grab (good no call).I think the offsides was a bad call. I wouldn't have called the false start, either. Both were close enough to the snap (in real time, not slow mo) to not call either.
Pics
I've only tried to use it a handful of times, but it's never once worked for me. How is that possible?
They were reminded the game has to stay close because Saban can''t get embarrassed on national television.
You root for USC, you should be used to rooting for the evil empire.
> All do respect
You didn''t see any face mask because you weren''t looking for it. It was VERY obvious
whos to say that scott doesnt outkick his coverage if he is moved back further... Idk, you are right tho. I guess it is a ten yard difference from starting at their 40 to the 50 yard line
No exaggeration, every 9 seconds WatchESPN is delaying. EDIT: ESPN2 the homer stream is pretty solid 
This is bullshit. I'm using the ESPN app to watch the game and the quality is shitty as hell and/or frozen during play but all of the ads come in perfectly and crystal clear.
I sense a bama turnover coming
Water
I'm convinced it will always suck. 
It should''ve been false start. So technically the block wouldn''t have counted anyways 
Only ticky tack flags and technically correct but not actually correct flags are what fans get mad about. Obvious bias flags or no flags like this one.
You have a stroke there?
3 false starts on the blocked punt, Georgia player wasn't offsides, and the missed facemask. That counts as 5 penalties that went Alabama's way in a game they had no momentum in. Game changing 
flair checks out
Exactly 
You can't have that on a run. 
Same
Either way there should've been a false start called on Bama so it wouldn't have mattered
True...it's a gamble
Did you move forward or backward due to the penalty your team committed? How about the blatant facemask that every official pretended not to see a couple of plays later? 
Whatever the refs are, you?
There was a bama player who flinched on that side. False start. They showed the replay.
Lol I was typing an angry reply when the sarcasm caught up to me. Jesus these refs. 
**B1G refs and their Alabama bias**
apology for poor englishwhen were you when bama dies?i was sat at home drizzling my brownies with mayo when phone ring‘saban is 0''‘no''
Hired
Buffalo Trace
Could they not just decline the penalty? 
Water
No.  And should have been a false start on Bama.
Not ACC apparently!
get out!
Roll Tide 
Georgia spent all their money on recruits. They couldn't match Alabama's offer.
You would.
They've only showed the side view once, and he didn't look off but someone else said the camera wasn't aligned with the LOS so it's hard to tell
The committee is to blame for both Clemson AND Oklahoma LOSING? OK. 
They ARE slowing down the game, but for reviews. Penalties don't cause commercial breaks.
Offsides bad callNo facemaskNo block in the back on that punt.3 big incorrect calls/no-calls Alabama's direction within 30 seconds of game
I blame this on Sean Payton. 
Hurts is hurting. Time to switch up too many chances already
nice!
Happy cakeday
Wtf
Belluminati
how'd it taste?
I'm blind, i'm deaf, i wanna be a football ref.Flows better this way ;)
Yeah he was a shinning light for them this year giving hope for the run game. But I'd prefer a guy like Barkley or Chubb. But you could slot Gallman at the receiver because he gets a fair number of receptions.
What?
"SURPRISE BITCHES."  -- Refs.
no more handoffs to swift.   chubb or michel only
Tagged as " corndog up the ass guy "
Idk but refs drinking bama jizz. 
Should have been called for 12 men on the field again
shhh Tua is in to stay
What? Are you making up rules? 
In the Canadian football league they allow you to coaches challenge missed calls such as pass interference, holding, etc.  anybody in favor of that coming to college or nfl?
The coaches said it should've been an illegal procedure penalty on Alabama - Georgia guy wasn't offside, but the Bama lineman moved early. Should've been blown dead there.
No I think that's just the Colts
I feel like Saban has actually had someone killed at some point...
Right. 
Stick first?
Bamboozle
Maker''s
Eggnog
Well if the refs aren't gonna call it - where is UGA ball?
Welcome to every week of the last who knows how many years
Yeah, but a face mask is dangerous. You can really cause some bad injuries by doing that.
A face mask is not “playing hard,” it''s chreating and should be penalized.
They were doing well before this
K. Thanks for the coach in a few years.
Well I mean, the bigger issue is when not enforcing the rules and enforcing the rules incorrectly occur really close together and just so happen to benefit one team. Ignoring a penalty is just as much "deciding" the outcome of the game than calling them excessively.
Sooo meaty!
But you can! 
Wanted to say this during the halftime thread: WHERE THE FUCK IS WALLACE? WHERE'S WALLACE, STRING?
[when salt levels begin to rise](https://i.imgur.com/JQB7k.gif)
You guys caught some bad calls against us. Usually we are getting fucked to death by refs, so that was confusing.
PAAAAWWWWWLLLL
JACOB FROMM IS A TRUE FRESHMANGive me upvotes
I''m first half Refs and I have DirectTVAnd I''m a second half ref and I have cable. 
If you think these refs love Bama you should see how the refs treat Michigan....
We're reading. This just isn't surprising to us. 
No they are just biased towards Bama /s
I mean it really wasn't.
Ballsy move 
Salty at our success or the 42-14 skullfucking we gave ya? 
"Coach, what were your halftime adjustments?""I called the big ten offices and told them to get me some damn help"
Was it Frozen or heated up
You are absolutely right, buck bro 
B1G refs making PAC12 refs look good
Gin and tonic. 
Ya... That one was so obvious. The facemask was dicey but how do you miss that block in the back???
Sooo we're getting our ass kicked right now, and the game is rigged in our favor. Even when things are going swimmingly for the haters, their hate boners won't stop swinging lol. 
Saved 
welcome to B1G
To the opponent, yes
Herby keeps getting older but they keep staying the same age
Hope you wore a condom. 
He must have let go. I thought it should have been a block in the back.
They did in the after the play scuffle earlier.
What?
Learned from the master i guess
these refs are trash tbh
Saban must''ve told the refs he''ll summon a balrog to kill their families if they don''t win this game for him. 
This is exactly right. There was definitely a presnap penalty on that play, so regardless it was a do over. It's really not a game changer. 
Fucking saved.
He's a great player and an excellent leader. The issue is that as a freshman, Lane Kiffin simplified the scheme for him. It was pretty easy; he only let Jalen focus on half of the field instead of the whole field. He made the adjustments for Jalen from the sidelines. He also had Jalen's snap reads simplified, and his play reads simplified. Jalen was looking at one receiver, another receiver, then running.That's why he was such an effective player as a freshman, all the way up until Washington and Clemson.We were all hoping he'd develop further as a downfield passer and a standalone QB that can change plays and call the right audibles, but he really hasn't. That's not on him, that's on Daboll. Daboll has him running some complex NFL-like schemes with long developing plays and complicated reads that he just isn't ready for.
I was actually going to type something relevant but i literally stopped caring after .5sec haha. 
No they didn't.   A false start would have invalidated the block too.
Bad calls from refs.
is it just me or does Kirby Smart look exactly like Larry the Dr. Pepper dude
Yeah that was pretty shitty. Sorry dawg bro. 
He wasn't offsides. The coaches in the ESPN Filmroom replayed it a bunch.
How is that our fault?
I'd be so salty if I were a Bulldogs fan right now
Oh look a B1G official missed a facemask, that's neVeR HapPeNEd BefOrE.*PAC ref throws me out of the gamethread*
Onsides. False start on Bama too. Then the missed facemask. Refs just bent UGA over
He wasn't.  It was also a false start by Alabama that made him jump a little early(but not go offsides).So called correctly it wouldn't have been a block.
Their coach literally destroyed their second place trophy from last year. 
Jalen is back in!
Hot or cold?
Because he just rolls out and throws out of bounds while missing open receivers 
No, they break their trophies 
Unbelievable with this crap. Must weather the universe attempting to restore the great Georgia curse 
that was a terrible half time show, like really lol?
Weird shit like this is why LSU fans get made fun of 
La Croix 
Scoreboaaaaaaaaaaard!
He must think the weather in Alabama is “arctic”. 
[If only Les had the balls like Saban to do this this in 2012](http://i0.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/facebook/000/021/018/Ine1AkaF_400x400.jpg)
Obvious false startSS plus not across the line.  Bigly terrible call
B1G
what are you going to blame the clemson game on?
Think the PAC 12 refs still in Pasadena 
Mark this
Your defense forced them to play a Freshman QB, you're fine
B1G, I believe.
I can kinda forgive the offsides, but a facemask can seriously injure someone. That's gotta be called.
She doesn't even look like the Mona Lisa
Dilly dilly!
Not when it's ok to drag them down by the facemask.
Quick question, Is there any conference with good refs?
We should get Queens of the Stone Age for the next natty halftime
Did you add ketchup and mustard?
Apparently not haha
This isn''t even the best crew from the BIG10 IMO. Don''t know why they got chosen 
Hey, it can be both.
Offense doesn't work.
Is it REALLY unbelievable? Must be nice to be in the east...
Refs are doing their best to help
In real time I noticed two Alabama players moving, so one way or another they fucked it up.
Wish I hadn't read that
They would be punting it from 10 yards  further back
Little Bama privilege from the refs there 
More like the ***SHIT***son Tide
Taco Bell illuminati commercial is pretty good
Also, Trey Burke's block was clean.
Garbage offense. D is doing their part
Wow, the Georgia radio call one is way better. Thank you so much. 
EAT THE REFS! SLOW COOKED FOR AROUND 30 BEERS.
You don't like watching the buffering circle?
"Looks like a clean tackle to me." -that ref, probably
It might be time to start considering reviewable penalties. 
You can't get called for an ineligible receiver on a run...
ESPN payin'' the refs to keep this shit interesting so they can show us commercials for Iron Man 10 and the Admiral Ackbar Star Wars standalone. 
Well I'm back from being banned! I'll behave from now on.
Wouldn''t calling the false start have stopped the block from happening 
Nope.
Don''t kid yourself lol
Refs are shit.
Tua is 1-1 for 2 yards and his passer rating is double that of Hurts
White BBQ vs. Mustard BBQAnd go. 
No one outside of the Southeast really care about this game.
[deleted]
2 ftfy
Did you not watch the last drive?
You are probably right, but let me be angry plz.
Yeah. Anything that can decide the game should be reviewed, but whatever. Challenge rules are dumb. 
Big ten refs just letting them play good Midwest football. 
Water buddy. The 4th quarter is a long way away. 
Not really
Has the potential
I have personally scored as many points in the 2018 CFP National Championship as the entire Alabama team has so far.
If we lose this shit 14-13 I swear to god 
Between that and the missed offsides call it cost the Dawgs a lot. 
Program in shambles
Fucking watchespn app. I've missed the entire 3rd quarter because it's a piece of shit
Someone get these refs off Saban's ding dong please and thank you
Holy fuck, bad injury
Georgia got dicked on some penalties
On a run play?
Try the Spanish telecast. Much better stream for me.
Something something PAC-12
Big 10Or whoever they could find, not sure right now 
Facemask calls are missed for everyone, including us, and it just makes me mad everytime, partly because of how dangerous it could be.
Damn, a couple bad calls and the conspiracy theories are rampant!
He'll go far in the pros that one
It's all about money at the end of the day, honestly wouldn't be surprised if the refs are told "keep it close, we don't need people switching off early."
*CFB fan
Can the refs just eventually line up for Bama?  
Taco Bell really pandering to the stoner/conspiracy crowd
It's the college playoff national runner up game.
Ouch
And pulled out a bare wooden stick?
People don't refs calling very picky shit when it matters, but missing obvious things like that is a completely different conversation.
Taco Bell trolling conspiracy theorists. I've seen it all in my life now. 
My watch ESPN feed is unwatchable.Anyone else having issues?
You're only missing commercials.
I would say pics or it didn''t happen...but please no
Because the refs stopped calling penalties against bama
What? No18-22 year olds don''t give a shit about Vasoline
They smashed the trophy for losing last year so.... no.
Or trying to keep game close so more eyeballs keep watching. 
> Bama getting away with murder ~~these drives lol~~  FTFY
Fuck yes
Paaaaaaaaaaawl...
Mostly Bulleit. I also have some Yuengling Black & Tan, but it is not good.
Hurts was taken out so he could ref the second half.  
That facemask was so obvious
Sweet tea. I at Hudson Grille a stones throw from the dome. Amazing sweet tea. 
Wondering if anyone else seen that on the punt. 
holding u to this
Upvote this fam. 
I'm not a Georgia fan and I'm a fucking saltine right now
On one hand, my whole family are Dawgs (but nice people) but on the other hand, UGA beat OU and Im still salty.I guess I root for UGA so that the committee will STOP PUTTING IN TEAMS THAT DONT WIN THEIR CONFERENCE.
You don''t need slow mo or zoom to see the way his head turned. Pretty obvious what happened. I agree with you on the offsides. 
Missed call. I agree. The way he was able to get the pads masked it. No pun intended.
The Mona Lisa is overrated. It's like 8.5x11. 
Try going to a more annoying feed like Command Center. 100% better for me.
YouTube TV free trial is going great if you wanna spend it on this. 
As a neutral, I just like shirty on refs any chance I can get.
So a corn dog in the corn hole eh?
Thank you for being a respectable fan, sir. I'm sure the refs missed some on ourside too
I should be watching this in 1080p. Instead I'm struggling to get 144p on 600mbps connection...
I mean, I don''t want them to make a bunch of holding calls, but how does this crew get away with never calling it?  This crew just doesn''t call it. 
Nope, it's tua!
I'm glad I didn't read that
I''ve never seen them in the same room 
I think they still have it, presented by the AP poll. AP poll ain''t paying the bills so the focus is on the CFP trophy (aka ESPY for best college football team)
Taco Bell Illuminati sO CoOl WoW tHeYrE SOO HiP
That replay looked painful a.f.
Oh for fucks sake- it was clearly a face mask in slow mo from the PERFECTLY positioned camera. It was not so clear from the ref''s point of view in real time. 
Pics or it didn''t happen.
I can give them a pass on the blown off-sides but the facemask-turned-horsecollar was way to obvious not to flag. 
Alabama''s offense is awful when they don''t establish a run game for hurts and they ain''t doing shit when they put him in an obvious passing situation. Plus he''s been benched.
Nice face mask penalty, Buggs
No the game is already slow enough
Dry rub.
Flair up
Something something refs 
Hahaha bama gon lose.  Wish ucf coulda played against Georgia, maybe this woulda been an entertaining game.  Also bama fans shouldn't fucking talk till they get on the scoreboard, bunch of pathetic cocksmooches.
Miller light. 
switch to the other feeds.  I'm watching the skycam and the georgia radio feed.  They're much more stable and not 10 minutes behind.
Congrats!!
No
The last all SEC final ended in a shutout, just saying...
I think I'll be ok with that. 
It's still useful equipment but yeah you're probably a bad S&C coach if you let your kids squat with it.
Duke''s White BBQ all day 
Commercials aren't live. They can be cached/staged on multiple servers, but live video can't.
> 3 false startsYeah, 15 yard penalty 
Vinegar
It is astonishing how bad their stream is
Better than AAC refs.
What the fuck is white BBQ 
My command center isnt lagging behind, try a different stream
I've never really thought about this before, are refs allowed to throw a late flag if they didn't actually see it live? Obviously plays can undergo review for spotting, etc but I've never seen one done for penalties.
because their offense relies on winning the battle in the trenches and running the ball.
wrong
He turned the guys hut, thats a yank and pull
I Wish they still presented the crystal ball at the title game 
I hate Bama but please do something on offense to at least make this interesting
Not a horse collar but face mask was obv yeah
That was scary
Both are trashFITE ME
Hate you too bb
No he's not lol
The fuck is white bbq?
White. No question.
I feel like letting them play mostly applies to penalties like pass interference where it's a lot more subjective. A face mask is a face mask and should always be called especially because it's usually pretty obvious
Great throw...wow
But why do you have to be racist, tho?
Boy that shits vinegar and only NC folk eat that. We eat mustard here in SC
o shit that was close
Shit looks broke
They're beat up from the mercer game
Wait,, B1G refs this game? I am so sorry for all of you.
Those bad calls are gonna come back to haunt us, aren't they?
Damn, that was almost a huge play
Crimson "Seattle Seahawks" Tide
Has Saban lost it????
White bbq sauce sucks so bad. 
Mustard obv
Damn, fair point. Maybe until his bloodline dies? You know that dude fucks, so his lineage will be around a while. 
So watchespn lags like every minute but then the commercials play just fine. What the fuck? 
Damn Tua has an arm.
Damn. Tua has a cannon.
What time does the UCF champ game start
ugh... so close
We have been since 2012. 
I'm not mad, I'm just disappointed
It was a missed false start on Bama then the facemask followed by a potential second penalty from the same guy. So 2 or 3 right after each other that would both have been huge wins for UGA.
Good luck getting it out in one piece. 
This is where the bama fans chime in and say "let them play, y'all are soft"
At least we have the B1G representing the playoffs this year!
Somehow the refs have made it so that I'll be even angrier of Bama wins now. 
RIDLEY!!!!!
ThE sEc Is ThE bEsT cOnFeReNcE iN cOlLeGe FoOtBaLl 
should have started that free trial to ps vue for this game. 
How do you do this?
You tryna give me a seizure?
oof... linemen getting rolled up on never looks good, but Roquan slung in there at 99 miles an hour
Any mustard on it?
Go to the skycam or one of the radio broadcasts. Much better quality.
I sorted them by live but scrolled down so I can read at my own pace.
Depends on the person I guess.. Judging by Jalen's tendency to panic, I suspect you're right.
Great throw
I switched to the coaches film room espn stream, no lag for me.
So your argument is that it''s okay the refs incorrectly called the UGA player offsides because they also missed calling the Bama player for false starting. Solid. 
Jesus fuck what an arm
Decent throw . Improved from Jalen
had eeeem
So within in the span of two minutes, the refs...1. Missed the holding against Roquan Smith on his 3rd down sack.2. Missed the false start by 'Bama during the first punt that was blocked.3. Called offsides against Georgia on the blocked punt despite the player not being offsides and if the 'Bama for false start was called, the offsides wouldn't matter4. 'Bama got away with a facemask on Georgia's 3 and out drive after the 2nd punt that shouldn't have happened pinned Georgia in their own territoryTotal unbiased officiating this is...
 that was such a nice fucking pass tho
To all the people saying the ref was on the wrong side and couldn't see it: A neck doesn't snap like that unless it's a facemask. I could tell it was a facemask live, and I'm not 10 feet from it
I though Jeff Triplette retired? 
Two big time missed calls that were huge momentum swings. Take the biased glasses off for two seconds and understand why people are pissed at the refs.
Thank god Ridley didn't make that.
With no team in the game, I was wondering how the Big Ten was going to screw up.
 My bar is definitely full of salt right now.   Angry Dawgs.
Words can't begin to describe it all
Purposely calling the game in a certain way to make the game seem more competitive than it is, thereby maintaining viewer counts, and strengthening as revenue for the next 12 months? Yes. 
Is Tua a lefty?E: He is. Part of me wants to support a fellow lefty but another part of me wants Georgia to win because of Frat Stafford. 
RIDLEY, YOU COULD'VE HAD THAT, SO CLOSE. 
Already better than hurts lol
Not my refs. Not yours either. 
He played one series and was swarmed on third down lol he completed the first forward pass of the game. You honestly can't sit here and say you'd trade your qb for hurts, he has 100 ypg in cfp games. He had around the same against auburn last year, and not many more this year. He isn't a qb he's a running back 
Hurts would have made that throw. /s
lol
B1G refs are usually the most consistent in the p5, not sure what went on in their halftime room.
Motherfucker what
Wow Hurts can''t make that throw.
Riley>Calvin
No.
I fucking love plays like that
Terrible throw
Hands up if you watching on an Indian satellite feed and don''t need no Watch ESPN.I bet you don''t even know India is playing South Africa in cricket on Sunday.
Also he's got a killer haircut
the sarcasm in this doesn't read easily
but how do you know if the original model looks like the painting?
Everyone
Fearless prediction: Smart is the first coach from the Saban tree to beat the master. Saban retires sometime in the next 5 years. Smart takes over at Alabama. Alabama wins 17 of the next 25 national championships. 
Well, certainly looks like there's at least a QB back there now
the way the refs are going, they should've just called that a catch
Because all the pork rinds they eat?
Well, they did win the coin toss
Tua actually looks a lot better than Jalen
It''s easier for us to hate you if you''re a blind homer though. 
... A loaf? 
SEE, THEY SUCK SO MUCH THEY EVEN SUCK AT THE PAC12 REF PART!
GODDDD DAMMIT
ALMOST. FUCKING. HAD IT. FUCK ME.
I''ve had to reload the page five or six times since the starts of the quarter. It''s awful.
#savethecrew
So not only does the Big Ten screw the CFP by getting shutout in back to back years, they send their refs to fuck it up when they get left out
The fix is in! $EC BIA$!!!
In case you guys were wondering, no, I am not having a good time.
hot dam, to close for comfort
It missed but that''s what''s up now. 
defense please
Right through his hands
What a beautiful throw 
#
A lefty quarterback? What are they Wisconsin? 
Is there a broadcast delay? If so how long?
Heh I guess you could call this game a dog fight. Heh.
That one throw, if completed, would probably have been more yards than Jalen had all first half.
TF is up with all the lights?
Refs tend to not call a face mask if the player gives it up. Y'all need to chill 
Ridley could of had that 
I actually think replay in the NFL has gone to far with the catch rulings over the past few seasons
Dollar menu is even better
Left handed QB's kinda weird me out. 
Refs have missed a few calls tonight but none as obvious as that facemask no-call. BUT get real if you think B1G refs are cheating to help Alabama win. 
Oh shit!
Bama is F L U S T E R E DEdit: Just had a great an run, amazing run again, and almost a third 1st down in a row, aaaaand they scored fml.
You know it!
bama recruited the wrong Ridley.
jalen Hurts does not no de wey
Riley would have caught that
That was fucking ittttttttttttt
Or maybe they're told to make it close
Thanks for that insight, Wisconsin. 
Little much on that ball.
Damn that catch would've been nice 
The UGA band is more repetitive than OU's
Like Larry had a baby with Ted Cruz.
horse collar is only a tackle using the sides or back of the pads, not the front, and under the new rules, that isn't a facemask. Also, false start anyways.
...that guy died.
Juuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuust a bit outside.
The refs are trying to gift this to Alabama. It''s kinda disgusting. Missed false start and they call the non existent offside against the dawgs and Alabama gets away with a face mask. 
What kind of pizza is that on the coaches'' film room feed?
..... if you're trying to insult that BAMA education, you do you. 
I hate bama more. Plus, if GA can win we are 2-1 against teams in the final. I'll take that along with a bama loss
Yum.
Live vs pre-recorded... I'm not sure how the app is coded, but there's potentially a difference in how content is served.
No, make this thoroughly uninteresting.
Oh wow actually big name coaches. Assumed it would be retired old guys.
Oof, I can't believe he dropped that. Also, I love that Tua's a lefty like me. We're people too damn it
MORE DIES IRAE!!!
You been drinking tonight bud?
lol need the refs just to keep you in the game
Hey, they aren't pac12 refs
God damn I love this tune by UGA's band. Wish OU would blatantly steal it lol 
What a throw
But when it's that well-timed, when it's a split second and the offense is delayed getting off the ball, you're asking a lot for 100% accuracy on that call.
Ugly pass but at least in the vicinity of his WR?
Labatt Blue Light! 
you tried
Evidence is pointing to the contrary.
From a Pac-12 perspective: Any conference but ours.
He should have caught that ball.
Hey does anyone know the song Georgia's band keeps playing on defense?
Your internet. Ads are usually server side 
Can't believe that wasn't a touchdown to be honest 
Overthrown and incomplete, yet still the most exciting thing this offense has done all game
After this over, the teams playing for the National Championship will have three more combined losses than the only undefeated team in College Football - UCF.
Cochran should spend less time smashing trophies and more time conditioning his players against injury. /s
The shittides are blowing 
That man can throw a ball, gah damn.
fuck bama but this game is nowhere near over
And another egregious hold 
Ridley should have made that play
Are you fucking my dick fuck
Lol fuck no.
Same
Technically they're playing for bronze. Alabama/Georgia < Auburn < Our Lord and Savior UCF
Drink for every time it''s said. Edit: Wasted now. 
Friendship over with _JALEN HURTS_ now _TUA_ is my best friend
is....is that man dead?
There were 3 holds goddamn
Ridley is scary fucking fast
Damn that was close
Debatably should've been caught tbh.
Saame here. They deserve at least 3 more points.
I don't know who that is but fuck no lol 
For everyone saying 2 the offsides was fucking close you try calling that shit in real time
Your inability to put points on the board doesn't mean the refs haven't given you good breaks.
Jalens last name is just an understatement to how he played in the first half.
Bama bag men visited the refs at halftime 
Friendship ended with Calvin, now Riley is my best friend
This place boutta explode if this flag on Georgia
Welp, just ain't gonna happen if Calvin can't come up with that. 
Tua pls... we need a shut out
Last week bb
holding
Hurts just benched?  I know he struggled but going to a backup in this big of a game is ridiculous.  
ACC, SEC... that''s about it
White BBQ was incredible when I had it. Saws outside BHam was amazing.
God this game is so boring
Game theory: the B1G refs are acting like PAC 12 refs because they're salty about the B1G being left out of the playoffs
didn't think this game could get any worse until I saw them take out hurts
Its true, in both College and Pro.  It's not CTE that is going to drive me away from the game ...
Nah it was pretty clear in real time.
I hate Bama too, but the play would've been blown dead if they correctly called the false start, meaning they would've punted anyways.
Why is it that lefty QBs are always wild scramblers
Why don''t they have jaron running routes like this 
You're Jalen Hurts.  How do you feel?
Ads can be cached. It is bullshit I would be embarrassed to say I worked on watch espn
yes, this is why I'd rather see Hurts in the backfield and Tua holding the clipboard 
Use cfb stream reddit
If Bama doesn''t score here some walk-on is getting sacrificed 
Refs are still confused if this forward pass thing is legal
CDN's
I mean, if that's how you wanna party...
Reuben's Crikey IPA
[Here's what they did to last year's participation trophy](https://twitter.com/Deadspin/status/949058173956063232)
For anyone else having issues with WatchESPN, try one of the alternate streams. I swapped to the Georgia radio call stream and have not had any hiccups yet.Special thanks to /u/themattboard For pointing this out to me!
Great call, protection was perfect, receiver got wide open, and a bad pass. Rough.
It''s a trap!
Damn...dude has a rifle
If WatchESPN were a dog, we''d Old Yeller it
Just saw it live srry 
Hey that's not very nice
Tua has some great footwork for a true freshman 
Talking at the ref is an automatic ejection for the PAC.
All game UGA has said yeah we'll let Ridley beat the brakes off our DBs cuz we don't think your QB can get it to him.Bold strategy, Cotton.
Damn.
Idk man I wouldn't hesitate to go back to Hurts.  As a competitor, he should be fired up to redeem himself.
Bullshit
Judging by sabans history against dual threat QBs, you would have likely lost as well. Saban 0-7 against 9 win Auburn teams, guess he can't beat Auburn when they're not a dumpster fire either. 
Refs to the rescue!!
Riley Ridley would have caught that?
HOLY SHIT ALABAMA WAS HOLDING SO HARD
First down?
Agreed but I don't think the size is the reason it's overrated
andddd my streams gone. If anyone here is considering Hulu Live, save yourself the pain and agony and don't. Shit is straight useless.
Ball don't lie
Actually, you're right. Bama shouldn't have been in but they SMOKED Clemson. So?  Who should have been in then?Fuck it, put UCF in next time.
Does anyone know what year Jake Fromm is? I just can't figure it out
1st Down?
O_________O
Every play is pass interference.But seriously, we know there are black people in the south. That is sort of how the problems got started.
This dude is way better than Hurts. Holy shit.
Holy fuck this is actually fixed, guys.
These refs making /r/CFB have to support UCFs claim if Bama wins 
Wut 
2 years, damn
White with potatoes. Mustard with meat.
A first down????
How do Alabama fans feel about the QB change?
HAH HAD EEEEEM
Literally the best way to ruin a game...give them B10 refs. 
We all die 
Refs fucking ruined UGA''s momentum 
look at the beautiful halo board
Holy holding
What just happened....?
could have*
lol
Fuck that was close!D:
1st down????
I question if UCF could do better on offense. 
first down??
I'm not calling that a drop, but the best WR in the country should catch that.
???
I don''t know if I''ve ever said this before.... it seems like Bama is panicking. Stick to your game plan 
Halftime shows should be entertaining (think Prince). This one wasn't even though I like Humble. It was just boring watching a guy rap to a mic.... No flare.Black panther looks like CGI shit
If it keeps going like this, the two all-SEC natty's this decade have been by far the most boring ones.
What
WHAT? Did he just say a first down?
Yeah, players just twist their heads around like that on their own all the time. 
Shitty either way :(
NO PI?  C'MON REFS I THOUGHT YOU WERE HALPING
what?
?????
Call the fucking holdings jesus christ 
What is going on
Wait what?
What?
They literally chaned their QB. That''s at least an attempt to create some excitement.
Ok so why throw the flag in the first place
Wait what
Its their only chance
This kid being in tells me that Bama is done. 
Oh man you've got to make that catch! That was a pretty throw. Damn, why wasn't this kid starting all year? Hurts doesn't have that. 
Bama we will take Hurts if you want. No biggie.
As is tradition. 
I said it as it happened on TV. Not a good camera angle. Just watch the way his head turns unnaturally. It's obvious. 
Um what 1st down?
Hurns would have made that throw. Lol Saban.
LMFAO TUA TURNED THE WRONG WAY 
what?
Thought they were B1G refs
You''re 2-1 regardless
Refs are cheating 
1st Down? Are the refs high?
First down lol
Did... did he just say 3rd down??
First down......????
I mean, that''s not a bad throw imo.  Came close to working. 
"That's Ford, and that's how you become the most trusted brand."No, bullshit. You become the most trusted brand by producing the Ranger, discontinuing it... and having the zombies still be so reliable that they've regained popularity in the US market. You make a truck that lives so long that it brings itself back from the dead. **That's** how you become the most trusted brand.
UCF would be up by 2 scores on George by now. 
Not only that but they also claim a few National Championships they didn''t win. Good stuff
I would've named my first son Tua - my friend
There is no holding because.... uh... first down.
Why did Hurts get taken out?
What?? 1st down??
Fucking baffled that Hurts is still on the bench.
R E F B A L L
What???!!!!
What? How? He was like 5 yards short?
These refs are something special....
little tua long
Is it just me or was that an ugly throwing motion?
Uhh... That was a 3 yard gain, ref. It's third down 
Eastern North Carolina's Vinegar-based sauce kicks all ass.I am not at all biased
Pass wasn't bad..
1st down?
These refs are a joke
First down? Huh?
That play did not result in a first down...
Lol, 1st down? Wtf
"The play results in a first down"??!!
WTF with these refs?  first down?
First down? How?
That play does not result in a first down. 
First down huh refs?
1st DOWN WHAT
"We forgot we can't penalize Alabama"
This ref is drunk
Wait, how on earth is that a first down? 
Wow .That spin.  That was pretty 
Did he even run 10 yards?
These refs are fucking stupid. 
Yeah, but he grabbed the facemask first.
Lol what?! These refs just throwing out first downs now. 
"Touchdown Bama"
We just realized Alabama is down, so no flag
"Fuck it we don't need the holding penalty"
1st down wtffdfdddjlol
Sure. Now you throw the flag... For nothing
100%
thats his super power
usually when people talk about the refs deciding the game, they mean calling a shit ton of penalties
First down? Lmao
refs making up first downs now
Oh my god they were roommates 
Pretty sure Ridley is just not used to the ball being thrown that far down field on long plays...
WTF, how was that a first down???
1st down????
These refs just don''t give a fuck anymore 
His throws look so much better
Play results in a first down??? What the fuck!??
REFS?
It's first down my asshole...
Of course there''s no foul
Nice first down call
THEY AIN'T GOT NO QUARTERBACK PAWWWWLLLLLL
Refs smoking something 
Missed holding. The fix is in.
The trophy should be a gold college textbook. #studentathletes /s
Go watch your shitty team then.
thing looked perfect
How many fucking tv screens are in that stadium?
A beer from Cincy called Truth that my brother brought up for Christmas, a nice IPA. And an awesome beer from around South Bend, IN called Zombie Dust that is one of my favorite new beers. Also an IPA but “juiceir”. Dad and I decided to do something different and grilled up some Octopus with a loaded Greek salad. It all went great together. 
Snake? Snake?! SNAAAAAKE!
The play does not result in a first down you losers
I looked up Tua Tagovailoa's height, he's listed at "6'1""Chris Fowler stole my notes about Fromm and Tua 
wut?
Buffalo Wild Wings
Or they're told to try to keep it close
Ok good
Lol first down, right. 
Wait, how does that result in a first?
HOLY HOLDING
Does this burn his redshirt? 
That ref said first down *engage tinfoil hat*
These refs are idiots 
There it is. PROOF 
I'm liking it, but I've also never seen this dude play before
Refs don't even know the fucking down 
This is some blatant-ass holding not being called on Bama, wtf
sometimes i wonder what the world would be like if ridley caught that
play results in a 1st down....da fuck refs
Play results in a first down. Holy shit. Bad night for these refs 
I love the board they have up in the ceiling
The ref wanted it to be first down for Bama so bad
GOT THE FIRST WAT
"There is no foul on the play, the play results in a 1st down"lol okay man
"Throw the flag just in case Bama doesn't get a first down"-- refs
shoutout to youtubeTV for doing more with the ESPN stream than the ESPN app could.  Hasn't stuttered or dropped out of HD since kickoff.
First down? LOL
Did he just say the result is a first down??
refs trying to give them a first down lol
What's up with the Instagram pic collage next to the game screen
Lol these refs suck
These refs are fucking ass the second half
Lol these refs trollin hard
1st or 3rd down???
"the play results in a 1st down"  lmfao
First down...cuz...umm..shut up!
It's the second one
Play results in a 1st?  What the fuck?
Results in a first down? Damn the refs trying to let Bama back in and they're not hiding it lmao
See they tryna give Bama a first down on a 3 yard gain.
Bama fans right now: It''s okay that the refs blew the offsides call because they also missed the false start that should have caused a dead ball.Because that''s what we all want to see, a terrible call offset by a missed call. 
So true 
The refs have been great all night man
It was either a false start or offsides, either way no blocked kick.
Please don''t tempt the football Gods
first down???
You're not wrong. Lol
Crowd is loud.
Just curious, how do we feel about the refs performance?
Still 3rd officials are ass
True Freshman
Drink more
oh yeaaaah, they're REALLY trying.../s  gtfo here
"we forgot we're not calling holding on Bama. 3rd down"
Oh boy, refs...
I know, right?  These fuckers are embarrassing
DUH duh DUNH dunh dunh dunh dunhhhhh .... dunhhh
that arm tho
First down? Where? 
*play results in first down*refs been drinking too. 
These refs lol
How is that 1st down Bama? The refs are so bad.
Ref tries to give them first down. 
C'MOOOON Bama
Fucking so much holding
Refs just gifting first downs lmao
Ooh goddammit refs don't embarrass us
Bamas QB looks a ton like Justin Thomas on the field. Wow I miss that guy.
Refs trying to confuse everyone that it's first down instead of third 
Did he say 1St down??? LOL
TUA THE MAGICIAN
He has been terrible the last 2 games 
WOW
Wtf was that lol 
These refs are embarrassing 
The refs straight up glitching
First down, what?
alabama is holding what the fuck call it 
ahhhhh motherfucker.
#LMFAO @ THAT RUN
What the fuck are these refs on 
Uhhhh ours IS one.
ESPN probably told them to.
Refs love Bama so much, they tried to award them a first down they didn't earn.
1st down????
The fuck?
Wow
LMAO that play 
You''ve got to be shitting me. 
Sounds like Michigan
Is it really a great call if your QB can't make the throw?  It wasn't that bad.
These fucking refs, holy shit...
tackle bruh
Oh my word .. what a run . 
B1G refs.  That ain't gonna happen. 
PAC-12 definitely takes the cake sir
Tua holy fuck
Wait what?  1st down?
Refs got drunk at halftime  
Friendly reminder that OU scored 45 points in regular time against this Georgia D
Wrap up come on
Two true freshman qb''s!! What is this madness!
Oh boy, Tua is neat
Wow. The fuckin balls on this kid
#WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT
Tua tried to hand the ball off to no one lmfao
Nice 
HOLY SHIT
I literally saw 3 holds on that play
Not saying that. It wasn't as big of a miss. The commentators acted like it would have been a blocked kick.
da fuck? 1st?
3 yard gain is good enough for a first down lol
damn this boy has some feet
Did he fake to the wrong side twice in a row?
Tua is Jesus
Tua so far looks like he has better pocket awareness than Jalen
Wow
Tua bad, Jalen.
LOOOOOOOOOOOL at that tackling
Apparently Big Ten officials perform as well in playoff games as Big Ten teams do.
I want whatever these refs are having 
Wow what a wild third down conversion
DAMN
Thank fuck.
A LEGEND IS BORN (?) !
you have to be fucking kidding me
Tua can actually throw the ball and avoid the pressure in the pocket.
Wow wrap him up
Refs just trying to give a free first down.
Mississippi Mud Black and Tan. 
Damn that was wild
MANZIEL IS BACK
Jesus
WHAT A RUN TUA
YOU HAVE GOT TO BE FUCKING KIDDING ME
WOW!
????????????????????????????????
Tuagoatluva
What a play.
Wtf hit him 
What even
Wrap up, boys.
Holy shit!
[Nope](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/88/b9/22/88b9229ad55495ae221d197b70445967.jpg)
Tua looks like a backup but Hurts looked like a 3rd stringer so this is definitely an upgrade
Are the officials pounding shots during commercials? 
wow what a run
How the fuck do you not fucking tackle him down
There was some questionable blocking back there 
Haha ref screwed up! He thought he helped bama when he didnt. Instafired
Why isnt Hurts in?
Wow that was fun.
This dude is cheeks can they go back to Hurns 
It's quite nice
site's down but here you go http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:w__RRd_eCjkJ:bigbobgibson.com/+&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us
I have no idea I'm just a drunk college football fan.
Finish the fucking tackle. 
HOLY SHIT
[deleted]
But why tho
Screwy Saban is losing it? I''d have this team up 1000-0! Needs ref help? SAD!
holy fuck how did tua get out of that
**WOW**
Holy fucking shit
As a LSU fan, im scared.
Ballsy run. 
Holy balls Tua!
lmao garbage tackling
Ohio State vs Oregon...how times have changed
Damn what an effort to keep it alive
"play results in a first down" uh no? It doesn't?
Looks like Nick Saban is going to lose another National Championship. Wonder if he's ever going to get over that hump
Wow, him staying up was impressive
What in the fuck
WTF TUA
Whoa!!!!!!
Oh my fucking god
Cmon Georgia you had him dead to rights..
Are you fucking joking with that tackling 
Holy fuck Tua GOAT 
GREAT VALUE MARIOTA!
Holy shit these officials are garbage.
lol holy shit 
This is actually fixed wow
Consciously avoided it.
Da fuq
Refs said 1st down. This is rigged.
What the fucking fuck. Are you fucking kidding me?? 
I swear to god these have got to be Pac12 refs lmao
Kirby is going full on Spurrier with that visor.
Hurts is done for the night after that play. 
"A huge ass right now for his replacement"misheard quote of the day
Fuck these refs.
Now that''s what I call effort 
lol UGA trying to hurt the QB instead of wrap him up.  fools
Wow! Nice first down I got so mad at him for not throwing it till he pulled it off 
CMON TUA!!
Lol wut
Sweet tackling 
TUA FUCKING FOOTBALL
Why hasn't this kid been the QB all year? You can tell he's better than Hurts.
Nice tackling Georgia
That was a Russell Wilson play 
Not offsides, but Bama should have been called for a false start. Sucks, but not really all that big of a difference...
Wow refs are really trying to fuck GA
"It just means bored"
How was there no holding flag in that on #77? 
Tua the GOAT confirmed
wowza 
First down? What? 
That tackling -_-
Wow, can''t believe he evaded that
wow just fucking wow
What??? 
ITS THE SAME FUCKING ALABAMA PLAYER HOLDING EVERY SINGLE PLAY
Why why WHY does Alabama ALWAYS FIND A WAY. GOD THEY LITERALLY NEVER LOSE 
Tua the goat
who IS  this guy
Tua!
TACKLE YOU MOTHERFUCKERS
Oh you got to be quicker than that!
Can we trade Calvin for Riley tonght please
Wtf
Hawaiian qbs are the most mobile qbs do to @ me
Once again, why shouldn''t Hurts act in what is probably his own best interest and leave? Go somewhere where the fans won''t blame him for all the evils in the world...
LMAO like 8 holds on that play alone 
Jesus fucking Christ wrap up like your father's should have 
Yep this kid is going to be special
ARE YOU SEEING THIS SHIT???!! TUA!!!
WE MADE FORWARD PROGRESS
Geezus.
Those screens are gorgeous
DESPERATE NEED
Holy shit Tua
Lmao and you're all still complaining about hurts being benched
So not used to seeing a lefty QB. Fucks with my head every drop back. 
Wait what?!
Arm tackles, arm tackles everywhere
You want to win a championship? Finish your fucking tackle
lol but Bama!
I'm half sarcastic. I think its ridiculous that an undefeated conference champion isn't given the chance to compete for a national championship, but that's a critique of the current system a lot more then a critique of Alabama. 
Ref #1 " oops saw Bama commit a penalty"Ref #2 "well just say no penalty on the play"
Wtf holding
Dude this kid is gonna be great
that play actually does result in a first down 
Lolrefs
HOW THE HELL DID HE STAY UP?
Wait seriously, what happened to Hurts?
This kid has heart
Frosh
You had him 3 fucking times
Damn, I know Ridley didn''t catch that but the ball was thrown like 60 yards
Wow. Kid can ball.
Yeah I think it goes like this:*STOMP CLAP STOMP CLAP*“Be a man. A Ram man. Get a Ram 1500.”
What happened to Hurts?
Looks like Russell Wilson out there avoiding the sack
How did you let him through???
Omg. How does that happen?
What the hell is with this officiating?
Looked like johnny football
Holy shit, the flyin Hawaiian is a baller
How is Alabama good enough to be in this game?
I haven't heard much about Sam Darnold tonight? What gives, ESPN?
TUUUUAAAAA
thats some nice scrambling there
Dude, even Lady Gaga's halftime superbowl was super entertaining. This was just... a run of the mill rap concert.
How was there no holding there?
ref goes >sorry nick I tried
As someone trapped on a road trip, I''m thankful for these comments acting as a better play by play than I''ve ever heard done by a color commentator
This guy is way better than Jalen
Holy shit this kid has an arm
Great Tackling Georgia!
Less than 100 total yards. They are panicking 
WatchESPN with the clutch lag to show me everything except the actual plays.
At least Tua is in there trying to make something happen.I'm good with whatever happens. We've done so well for the past decade, avenged our Clemson loss, beat two of our three rivals, and the title will be in the SEC. 
Refs were getting high at the Kendrick show. Confirmed 
Wilson-esque by the diminutive Tagovailoa 
Lol Georgia's fucked 
Pot and the kettle
Holy fuck. Bama isn't going to lose until Tua goes pro.
NCAA 2005 Update: Uncharacteristically, my offense went 3 and out to end the 3rd quarter so I was forced to punt. However, LSU muffed my team's great punt and the Gators recovered so it's 1st and 10 on the Tiger 24 yard line with 4:51 to go in the game. Golden opportunity for me to extend my 11-0 lead
*Tua intensifies*
This kid is it
Tua already looks a lot better than Hurts
What the hell was that?  Cam Newton and Russell Wilson dream of plays like that.
does tua speak english yet
It''s been 2 drives but Tua already looks so much better than Hurts 
Where's that from? Northeast here
This kid looks really good, fuck.
There were like 2 holding calls to break that scramble
He's much more mobile than Hurts?
Jeeeeez he looks like Russ Wilson out there.
Can I be real for a second?The CFP logo is sexy as fuck. It's simple but makes a statement 
The refs smoked something at halftime
Must've doused that man in butter 
That's 2007 Tony Romo right there. Unbelievable. 
Just for the record, this is the same crew that gave JT a first down.I feel your pain Georgia.
“What the fuck are you doing, you can''t call that on Bama!”
Holy shit these refs are *amazing*
That was some shit tackling by Georgia.
oh ok lol
That's how you prove your worth on your feet.
So many fucking holds
TUA
JESUS CHRIST... How the fuck dow you not get to him there?!
He sucks ass
Heard that 
The view of Fromm looking up at the screens. I want my living room to look like that
Tua time!
So I guess Hurts is benched next year?
Tua the Tank
That's game. It was really fun while it lasted. 
holy shit what a play
Fuck that''s gonna be the flipped switch play isn''t it 
Not just refs.
This game is turning into some serious bullshit. 
Refs just trying to give Bama a first down lol.
DAGGUM! That was some Johnny Football stuff there!
what happend to the other qb?
Tua is so much better than Jalen 
he sucks
Tua the second coming of alabama
uhhh ohhh bama found a QB
Tuna making plays. 
Oh fuck me, really? 
Holy shit it''s happening!
Jesus what kind of routes where those?
Let's get The Killers for next year's halftime. Cool? Cool. 
Saban just snuck Johnny football on to the field 
I'm just tuning in, when did Jalen Hurts get pulled? Or did Tua start?
Wow... B1G refs have lost the plot...trying to give Bama first downs... don't be two obvious
DIMES 
That was good! 
Come on DAWGS, you had him there
Damn Tua. Impressive. You shouldn't even be on the field rn tho if the refs hadn't helped y'all 
I guess I can say YOU'RE WELCOME
Why are the best QBs always from Hawaii
Dammit now Bama has an actual QB
Missed two block in the backs on that run.. This is sad.
Looked like Johnny Football on that one ^RIP
That was Wentz like Jesus
Bama snuck Russell Wilson into the stadium and suited him up
This kid is worlds better than Hurts. Hurts should transfer it''s over
no block in the back on that scramble...
How TF did he get that first down?
Chris Berman would be fun for that play
Wut
Those defensive linemen should take a hard look in the mirror 
Y'all ever watched a B1G game? They don't call holds for shit, tOSU went like a year and a half without a single one
THESE REFS ARE FUCKING CLUELESS
That's some Eli Manning in super bowl 42 shit 
Yes he did
Why has this man not been starting all season?
#StartTuaIn2018
“1st down”
Got benched for being bad
Cold take: B1G refs don't know how to ref when in a temperate climate in January
that play was crazy, mad props
This is fucking embarrassing there was so many holds there
And here we go. GG Georgia
I know he's only been in for like 6 plays but Tua is more fun to watch than Hurts
Is this kid gonna do this?! 
Shite tackling, watch bama score now. 
he split em lol
they should have started  this kid.
Big Ten baby
Tua belongs on a team where he can actually throw consistently. ^(come to oregon bby)
Hurts bud you better transfer lol
Damn hell of a play.
Last game of the year, Brent. Can't hold anything back. 
just think...taggart and him...
I just assume Hawaii only has one high school
tua>jalen confirmed
Can we not bring up Oregon heartbreak right now?
These refs are brain damaged
THREEE GUYS on him, and he escapes. Fuck.
Tua and Hurts are basically the same QB
Tua is giving them a spark.
I thought it was our lack of a good QB
That was Eli-pre-helmet-catch-esq /Patsfan
You need to lay a helmet on that QBs chinstrap. Finish him 
Turns out Bama actually has an offense when they have a QB.
Are you questioning Lord Saban?
Why the fuck did he not start most of the year!?
The refs opened the door and this kid is busting it down. 
These refs.
Fuuuuuuuuuuuuck
Yep upvotes for you!
Tua going to get his 30 for 30 before his junior year.
He suxdix
RIP Jalen Hurts
Terrible tackling
I've heard that Saban is, like, really smart
Why?
I can feel the momentum swing like a sledgehammer. 
Alabama needs to fix up that O line 
Renewed intrigue 
Hahahaha what the fuck was that!! 
JUST CAUSE WE WANT TO!
Well Alabama won, no stopping it.
Cheatin ass refs
HOLDING AGAIN LMAO TF
Did the refs all smoke a bowl during halftime???
Whew lad
Tagoviloa, a juvenile delinquent in the off season...
If refs were under any threat of getting fired maybe they''d do a better job 
That was fucking cool.  
lets go
Saban letting an untested true freshman sling it every play, crazy 
 #13 looking like Marino Vick
These refs are more barred out than my roommate right now. 
I miss Halo 2 and Halo 3. Especially the MLG competitive play. 
what can you guys tell me about this backup? did tua go to bama to play school?
Lol first down?
white is the greatest on chicken. Otherwise mustard. 
If Bama comes back to win this, Tua breaking out of that tackle is gonna be the turning point
a wild offense appears 
i hate bama, but i'm from hawaii. i'm conflicted. 
please defense
Goddamn fucking NFL replacement refs officiating this shit. 
And spread everywhere... California, Tennessee, Alabama, Florida... he's the Genghis Khan of college football.
The ref with the Freudian slip wanting bama to win 
It''s on now bitches! TUA TUA TUA
What a play, all heart
Saban paid these refs wtf
Tebow x Mariota HYPE
We've seen this movie before 
T R U E  F R E S H M A N
Wait where is goofy hair dude
If we keep the 4 team playoff, vote in the top 4 conference champs or an independent. Make it meaningful to win your conference. If we expand to 8 or more, get rid of the conference championships
Bama's going to score after ref shenanigans. Fucking hell.
Never seen a chain gang guy get demolished that badly
Why is it that I can watch ads in clear HD and when the game comes back on it's constantly lagging? 
Stadium announcer correcting the ref lol
Now refs are just giving Alabama first downs. 
Did they just bench Mr. Clutch?
so this is where alabama wins it, right?
Ya know... Tua might've been the right call
Refs arent biased... just horrible..
Finish your tackles boys.
Benched for ineffectiveness.
Hold, hold, hold. No flags
Oh my gosh this guy really is Mariota and not just because he's from Hawaii
"Lefty" Russell Wilson
Holy shit we're witnessing the next mariota being born on the national stage
wow
They can eat with Harbaugh at Neopapali's
Tua needs to lower his passes or he's going to over shoot a guy.
True freshman to true freshman OMG GUYS
What a run
Jalen got pulled
AMA Request: Anybody that attended the apparently wild party the refs held at halftime
These refs should be fired. I mean really fired and black balled. Like cannot work again in the field 
Shit. We have a game now
Tua is special you can see it 
Is this bama qb Tongan or Samoan
They got their own Johnny 
Add one more for that picked up flag on an obvious hold
Pulled after halftime
Georgia jesus Christ come on
Still no Bo or Harris.
Wow
LETS GO!!!
Refs completely changed the momentum of this game. This is infuriating. 
Holy fuck Tua
Shouldn't there be a commercial about now?
What a play. 
How the F did TUA not start for them 5 games ago?  Saban needs to be fired.
PULL US TO THE HOUSE TUGBOAT
Jalen pulled 
B1G classic officiating holy hell
Oh shit we got a game now 
Why does the band keep playing the same tune 
Just what we needed.  A Bama that can throw.  Greeeeeat...
Tua already has more passing yards than Jalen
Just found out K.Dot was playing at halftime... While I was taking a fucking shower. FML 
Sucks 
Hurts will never see the field again
Refs got the big MO going
0 holding calls
WRAPUP
Looks like Alabama was just told they were trailing by 13 points. 
Wow that hurts ba dum tss
Hey I want that for you too buddy
Oh God, not again... 
Man jaylen hurts must hate life right now
"It's just a different feel for Alabama right now". I wonder why...
GET ME A PINEAPPLE! IT'S TUA TIME!
What black magic fuckery was that?!
Man what a play. 
Georgia not tackling all of a sudden
How often has Tua played this season?
Did you know Tua is a true freshman?
Imagine losing two games total and then getting pulled in the national championship after a questionable half.  Man that's salty lol Saban **plays no games**
RIP ESPN stream 
That Tua run was some voodoo bullshit
TUA GOAT
Y'all was that a fucking pass???
Nah man, Alabama o line is allowed to tackle people
http://www.emburl.ml/embed/video.php?v=bS9DS0tMSllaQkZqQlZPeGovM0VDbmVyaGIxenlvaVhtMER2T1J3QlpkeFJQVmpFR3J1dkN0WWlhVkp6ZVBwdg==
TRUE FRESHMAN TRUE FRESHMAN
Jalen Hurts gonna have to transfer if he wants to play again
His play hurt the team
got pulled at halftime.
Mark my words, that missed tackle is going to be the start of the L Georgia is about to take. I don't even like Bama, but I've seen it one too many times.
Refs about to bring Bama back in it
Russell Wilson level play right there. 
...is this actually going to work?
He stunk up the place for 30minutes
I will say I fuck with Tua
THE TSUNAMI IS UNLEASHED FUCK YEA
come on georgia
Alabama with an actual QB is terrifying
See, he doesn't have to speak English to be good quarterback.
Looks familiar 
Thank god i'm not the only one. What's going on?
Tua "put the team on my back"
It's just really hard for me to enjoy football. Every time I see it on tv i just can't help but remember those poor 5 hookers slain at the hands of craig james while at SMU
That Tua kid is pretty nifty in the pocket.
You never had me you didn't even have your car. 
...So maybe Jalen was the problem
Hurts time at Bama might be over...
Pressure him Georgia.... 
hurts was pulled
Naw the refs dressed for B1G football, they're just suffering from heat exhaustion.
Guys it''s possible for a ref to misspeak. It''s a huge stage for him too.If he wanted to help Bama he would have just called the penalty anyway...there''s easier ways than gifting first downs illegally lmao
Thanks buddy. 
Not like thisNot with the true freshman halftime replacementPlease no
dont ruin the shutout meme :(
TUA about to play a Cardale Jones
Bama has offense now.
It was a great pass. Can't really blame anyone on a miss by mere inches on a 50 yard bomb 
WOW HOLY TUA!!!!!!!
Did he do a stupid money gesture then hit a girl? 
Hurt was playing like ass
It's a shame the snow in Atlanta melted already, that probably would've blown his mind
FINALLY TUA TIME
Uh-oh
He's not playing well at all
Is this really what''s gonna happen? Refs pull some shit?
Tua throwing strikes holy shit
Bama opening up the gameplay
Eli is much more graceful though
Saban doing his devil stuff again. Fuck this
The birth of Tua Football
Tua time
TUA TIME!!!!
Yeah but then it wouldn''t be a game. 
must've been a god tier half time speech
Imagine losing your starting job in the National Championship game
Holy fuck this guy
UGA should start getting worried. 
He started 3rd Q.  
If you are feeling like you want to die, just drink every time you hear freshman.
Hot take: Saban kept Tua on the bench all year so Georgia couldn't have film on him 
Choo choo bitch
Refs felt like the Dawgs were getting outta hand
Ok, kid. 
Refs trying desperately to give Bama momentum. 
Hurts was pulled at the half.
RIP WentzFoles better pull it out
Tua bad for Jalen.
with a single finger. still not a facemask under the new rules.
Tua bout to be a damn legend
QB change and bringing back the blocked punt gave them too much momentum I don't like this
This is not ideal
Wow what the fuck is happening. Alabama throwing the ball 
We have an offense? Who'd a thunk it
Bama has all these unreal true freshmen.... wtf when are they gonna be bad again 
All he did was tackle a guy. Totally not holding.
halftime switch.  hurts has been ass.
So if Tua brings this back, will Jalen Hurts make a pic of Tua holding the trophy his phone screen?
Wow he stood up to take that hit and make the throw
These are the fucking refs they choose for the fucking national championship game?
Ok, now I''m scared.
Oh shit Tua is good
WHAT IS HAPPENING I LIKE IT BUT WHAT IS HAPPENING
I really don't get the logic of ever playing Jalen ... what the hell
Russel Wilson playing for Alabama now 
Official just called 1st down when it's 3rd down. It's time to start drug testing the refs.
They got an actual QB now Georgia.... you gotta cover
Damn Alabama woke up
Wtf why didn't tua start?
Jesus Bama looks amazing with Tua
F A S T P A C E D  A  S  T  P  A  C  E  D  
Personally I think it was taking away a blocked punt at the 15
I agree
So where does Hurts transfer to? He isn't getting the starting spot back.
Bama held lol
I swear to god if Bama wins this game
When's the last time a starting QB has been benched in a national championship game when the game wasn't locked up or out of reach? This is crazy, and what a gutsy call.How much has this kid played this year?
Refs flipped the game
Tua is the chosen one
So this is what happens when bama puts in a qb
Well, this is getting interesting.
TUA
Jalen Who?
Im watching on a tablet and it freezes up like every minute. Its only for a few seconds at a time but yeah its extremely annoying.
Thanks for the momentum refs
jesus bama just changed their whole offense at halftime
Start of the 2nd half
oh he got pulled? damn  thx
Bama with a passing game? Wew lad
Refs gave them momentum
I don''t like this new guy
That was like a shitty version of a Quinton Flowers play. 
Tua changing the game. If Saban wins he's a genius.
GOAT
He may never get the job back
He got them video game legs
Sounds awesome! 
I think he''s saying if Alabama is flagged for jumping early, it''s the same outcome as this flag on Georgia as they play would be blown dead.Of course it only reinforces that was an extremely favourable sequence for Alabama. 
MVP if Tide turn this around?
Are we doing it?!
When Bama goes up, refs will make calls for Georgia 
False
Hurts is going to cry himself to sleep tonight.
Where were you when Georgia was kill?
Hurts was the problem 
This kid is pretty good
Georgia is about to get ref'd
Are you saying you didn't?!
Jalen may never start again
And the refs get bama back in the game. Classic
Can Tua throw a TD to himself like Mariota? 
Hurts may never see the field again
Two true freshman QBs are leading their teams in the National Championship game. Has that ever happened?
TUAAAAAAAAAA
Things are getting spicy!!!!
bamaoffenserisingfromthedead.gif
Dammit Georgia 
What is going on at buffalo wild wings right now?
He''s playing well. Still bonkers
Somehow Bama is going to fuck this up
How nice of Bama to wait till the last game of the season to play their actual starting quarterback 
Is Tua a dual threat or pro style? Or something else?
ASS
If Bama were to win this game after switching QB''s at halftime of the national championship game....there is no god.
Well boys after Tua leads this team to Natty where does Hurts transfer to?
I fucking hate refs. 
oh my heart
He''s like Doug Williams. Only the GOAT when he comes off the bench
I'd be fuming if I were for Georgia. That was painfully obvious.
Are you joking? These refs are absolute garbage
Hurts can do whatever he wants but Tua is out playing him plain and simple. Hasn't played meaningful ball all season and has looked 10x times better 
Okay how did Alabama get a 1st down on that flag that wasn't a foul??? I'm very confused
Put jalen back in 
damn we blocked a damn punt and they gonna score 
It's pretty rare to see a run like that without any holds
Bama scores here, it's over. 
How bad is it to pull hurts here though. I mean he's started all year. Does he transfer now?
Here comes that tide roll. Clemson 2nd half copy pasta
All hail our lord and savior Tua Tagovailoa 
Should have actually been a false start on Bama, so it wouldn't have been a block, but maybe would have been a ten yard swing.
this game is clearly rigged for the sec #secbias  
Did Hurts just lose his job?
Is Jalen Hurt? 
TAG, I'M THE STARTER NOW!
True freshmen coming in and doin it
BAMA IS BACK
The officials have absolutely let Alabama back in this game. Kinda gross.
Shoulda been our points 
Just UGA things
How about calling some of these blatant penalties against Bama??
The amount of holding not being called right now is fucking unbelievable. For the first time ever I legitimately believe that the refs REALLY ARE purposely not calling shit. This is insane.
Holy shit, good job little buddy. Slippery fuck
Pulled
God damnit. Bama had a magic player just fucking sitting there. Heres 4 straight titles.
Yup that was Hurts''s last game. Tight End, Running Back or Transfer
Just came back after stepping away for a bit. What happened to Hurts?
Because they don't call fouls on Bama
Weren't they just saying how Tua isn't as mobile as Hurts? I could have swore I heard that.
shit Tua is really good
REMEMBER EVERY THREAD I SAID PUT IN TUA AND YOU ALL CALLED ME DUMB
Tua take me home 
Completely agree. This is so much better than the ESPN app. 
So if Saban is so good, why did he start a QB who can't throw over one who can for an entire season?
One play and now the offense is chugging along.
Tagovailoa reminds me of Jeremiah Masoli a bit. 
the fix is in, Freudian slip by the ref there. 
TUA TAGOppolo
Gg
georgia is fucked, refs already got Bama for this game. might as well literally stop playing LOOOOOOL this is so fucking blatantly obvious 
Tua is going to put up a billion points on us 
Fuck him.
BOOM
touch down
GAME ON
Saban is a genius. Game over. 
>suggests refs are ever held accountable ever
Try one of the alternate streams. They seem a lot better for me.
Ya Bish
Sorry, fell asleep, someone fill me in.  Hurts benched for being a shitty passer?
The Polynesian Tide
i wonder if Daboll wanted Tua all along?
Jalen Hurts transfer to Tennessee confirmed
B1G B1G B1G
Tua could make himself a Bama legend today. Or maybe not. Do y'all Bama fans care that much about championships still?
hi i just got off work. What happened to Jalen Hurts?
bama: not dead yet.
^oh ^no
Where have they been hiding this guy?
The Dawgs had their run, now it's about time for High Tide
The fix is in boi, the ref can't even get his story straight. Missed false start, missed face mask, missed block in the back, then calling a 3rd down 1st down
These refs doe
Georgia got fucked by those missed penalties
Fuck that score.
Um... what''s happening
Fuck that
Holy shit
Tua is balling out holy shit
Dat run tho!
YouTube TV Free Trail. I will never use WatchESPN again.
Fingers crossed.
Hold on Alabama when Tua was cutting back? He tackled the D guy from the side. That's the fourth missed call this quarter on Bama...
Is this where the Tua-naround starts?
I don't want to be reactionary, but it looks to me like Hurts is good as gone next year.
i wanna see if he caught that 
horse. shit. 
Classic ATL/Georgia teams. Get our hopes up. Then this.
Tua is now Bama's leader in passing yards.
DAT Saban Man Management DOEG.O.A.T.
T R U E F R E S H M A N
This game is over
fuck
damn tua is getting it done
TUA LEAD US TO THE PROMISED LAND
Should've kept the crystal ball though 
Like missed face mask calls 
Oh Georgia, no....
https://i.imgur.com/A0dhKim.jpg
Wowowowow 
Wow. Look how much shit reffing can change the momentum of a game. 
Jalen Hurts thinking about transfer destinations right about now.
GG UGA
Here we go
why is my stream pooping right now
>the absolute freshmeni got u
Refs 7 UGa 13
What a suprise, you gift them another chance and they score.
Why'd Hurtz get subbed they say?
Well it was fun while it lasted
Uh oh
Wow what a swing.
That missed face mask is going to be looked back on as the turning point in this game. And the salt will deservedly pour in
Very strange to pick up the holding flag... something's fucky
What the fuck just happened?
Getting that first down was big for Bama. NOOOO!
Oh shit. Bamas offense found some life
fucking christ 
dis bullshit Fuck Bama
Watching Dan Le Batard eat chicken wings
Wow
benched after halftime
Hurts is literally about to turn into gelatin
#TUATIME
5 straight throws though. Bama OC confident.
Nice job refs
OMG!!!! FRESHMAN!!!! THROWING WITH AUTHORITY!!!
How the Hell has Hurts kept this kid on the bench?
LET'S GO TUAAAAAAAAA
Georgia 13 Refs 7
Tua is your starter going forward.
Wow we have a fucking game
Physically resembles a left handed Russell Wilson with how he bounces around in the pocket. Last thing Bama needed was a good QB.
I mean...  like 6pm EST. Not too bad. 
We have ourselves a game boys
Holy shit this guy is a legit ad fuck.
Seeing Tua play for Bama hurts my soul.
TUA TUA TUA TUA TUA TUA
Holy shit TUA!
yup
My exact thought :/ asante should have made that interception and we would have won 
TUA IS THE TRUTH
SERIOUSLY WHAT THE FUCK.
TUA TIME 
Uhh, why was Hurts playing?
TUA TAGOVAILOA RULES! THIS GUY IS COOL!
They benched him.
Benched. 
Block in the back and holding there on the scramble. No call. Refs lol.
Lmao wtf Saban is a mad man
WTF
Yes
Nope
I'm torn. I hate alabama but fuck OSU. I guess if it's to piss off OSU I understand
This is fucking horse shit.
*deletes Alabama shut out memes*
TY REFS
that facemask call looming LARGE right now
Wow fresh blood
TUAAAAAAAAAA
ROLL TIDE!
At least we scored some points.
Or the multiple blown calls that directly created a net of about 60 yards for alabama.
benched coming out of halftime
Damn this kid has a gun
This is wild. Tua has changed the complexion of this game entirely. It's a freshman duel!
This is why we can't have nice things. 
GREATEST ALABAMA QB OF ALL TIME
Jalen to Flordia
RIP marker guy.
Fuck the refs.  
We needed that spark Jesus fucking Henry Christ 
lol at Hurts. 
Fuck. Need to recover. 
yaassssssssss
Jalen better start looking at transfer opportunities
no.
Let's go mini-Mariota!!!
holy shit
What is holding?
Fuck Alabama
TUUUUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!
TUA!!!!!---
And just like that the dream died
gosh darn it
GG Jalen Hurts
Tua is electric 
holding my beer a lil tighter
ROLL MOTHERFUCKING TIDE
Hey, thanks man
These refs are gonna get sooooooo much more shit now
Omg Tua wtf
Tua is fucking legit fuuccck Bama has a good qb again
I've always wondered why Hurts played. Dude stinks.
TUA TIME
Uh oh.  Somebody woke up Bama
Urban needs to take note about what changing your QB can do for your team
Why was this guy on the bench for so long?
Freshman to a freshman for our first points of the day lmao
We have a game folks 
Anything but a Georgia win is bullshit now. 
ASS ASS ASS ASS ASS !!!!!
Oh man. So turns out taking Hurts out wasn't the end of Bama after all, huh?
Rip Jalen Hurts 
ROW TAD
YEAAAAH!
Yep
Yeah Hurts is never starting at quarterback for the Crimson Tide again.
what in the fuck
RIP Halen Hurts
[deleted]
Dammit
YEESSSSSSSS
I bet this was discussed before the game. 
Yep
Yeah right 1st team all sec rb next season.
"This hurts"-Jalen Hurts
That Tua scramble will be on tv the next 365 days if they win this game.  Exactly what he needed to get comfortable in this game.
Refs stole this game from Georgia.
Of course Bama has a Samoan Russell Wilson in the tuck
Holy crap what a difference that drive was!
MOTHERFUCKIN TUA TIME!
Holy shit this game is over and they still behind.
I guess Saban knows what he's doing
Maybe bama fans were right about tua
Holy shit, Tua is my new father.This offense looks completely different.
Great another QB to worry about.
The teams switched jerseys at halftime, apparently.
Hurts got hurt
Jalen done lost his job
I''m no rules expert, but is it a new rule that you can''t be called for holding while playing for Alabama?
Uhhhh, OK, please put Jalen back in
TUA HOLY DICK
Well shit we got a freshman gunslinger competition 
This freshman lefty looks good!
We got a game. Hurts sucks confirmed.
We need a turnover. Big defensive play.
TUA TIME
I look forward to seeing Jalen Hurts transfer to Michigan next year!
One dude got pulled down chasing him. No call
Did Jalen get taken out or get hurt?
Holy fuck Tua 
Jalen needs to transfer 
Fuck this game. Refs handed them a TD
this is insane
RIP Jalen Hurts
Sounds familiar 
Welcome to the Tua Tagovailoa Experience folks. 
Damn this Freshman Quarterback for bama already better than hurts 
Refs 7Georgia 13
We finally have a game
No fucking way.
THE LANGUAGE BARRIER 
WUT
Tua throws a crisp ball
Georgia's defense just collapsed
I LOVE THIS KID!!! 
I guess the Georgia secondary decided to stay in the locker room for the second half 
There was a clear hold on the right side of that Tua scramble but I'll overlook it for the opportunity for at least one decent football play
SABAN ORCHESTRATIN A MASTAPIECEEdit: ^the ^bastard
Ruh roh
Holy shit
Its got to make you feel like shit to get pulled in the championship game. 
Yeah definitely not 
Hurts career is over
Way to go stripes, absolutely disgusting.
How did Hurts beat out Tua?
To any UGA fans saying things like “OMG we''re blowing out Bama!”:I''m from Atlanta. A lot of you are from Atlanta. 28-3. For the love of god, what''s it going to take for you to learn not to say things like that! 
Edge rushers barely trying on that play. Left edge literally jogging off the snap. Get after him cmon
3 Straight freshmen to freshmen connections between Ruggs and Tagavailoa
What is going on here?
Hurts' career in Bama over. Transfer now
FROSH DUEL.THESE KIDS ARE MY AGE WHAT THE FUCK
Yes. Looks like it was a good move 
Wouldn't want to interrupt a Bama drive. /s
Sometimes you just need something quick and recognizable to throw in between plays
See what blown officiating leads too
Refs swayed the momentum so hard. That sucks. 
Ugh put 7 in the ref column 
Here a hold there hold everywhere a hold 
Fuck the refs.
He just made that look so easy, holy shit
We will never beat this team 
#T U A#U#A
YESSSSS
Sorry Jalen... It's Tua time!
B1G refs, calling a hold is optional
They should have some bowl games up north just for shits and giggles
The refs let this shitshow happen. 
A moment of silence for Jalen Hurts career
What is happening 
Amazing what throwing the ball can do. Absolutely shocking. 
When your QB can actually throw you have success as a team? Who would''ve thought?
Fuck yeah
I like Tua as Qb
That looked so easy this time
Refs missed 3 calls, new guy can play football. 
To confuse Georgia
No, it's going to be 14-13 Bama. Saban will win one more because why not
Embarrassing refs
fucking refs
Oh shit
I am SHOOK
LETS FUCKING GO TUA
Bama gets help and now they are back  in the game
Disney be running the magic narrative
RIP Hurts
If it makes you feel any better, I''m not a fan in person.The upper decks can barely see even two screens.
It worked last year until the last game
Freshman Qb throwing darts
C'mon Saban. Be a real man. Win the Championship with your third string QB!
Call the fucking holding penalty. 
Time for Hurts to transfer.
Refs aren't gonna call shit on Bama 
Kinda being given to Bama with this officiating
Tua certainly throws with a lot more confidence than Hurts. Not afraid to stand in the pocket and scan the field. 
Damn this QB looks *good*
This dude throws bullets holy fuck
Oh fuck this not again
All it took was one first down to give Tua his confidence
ROLL TIDE. HERE WE GO
Aaron Murray is so nervous on the Homers stream.
Saban a genius?
ROLL TIDE
Relative to the first half of this game...spicy indeed!
I've watched enough football to know that Bama is going to win this game unthreatiningly somehow
Man Johnny Tsunami really brought this game to life. 
So this is what happens when Alabama has someone that knows how to even remotely throw a football?
Uh ohhh somebody learned how to throw
Espn should be ashamed of themselves for their stream
So this is how it happens. Wow.
holy shit Saban just unloaded his secret weapon
absolute trash
Well, remember those three missed tackles, Georgia. That''s probably where your season just died. 
Why the fuck were they playing Hurts all year if they had this guy?!
H8 H8 H8 H8
Holy shit what a drive
He got benched.
Fuck these fucking refs. Why do so many refs suck as much as they do?
TIDE GET OUT RRRRRRRREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
GEORGIA IS FUCKED!!!!!!!!
TUA IS THE GOAT
Hurts is done 
Do we need the brass spouting up on every play? lol 
Adjust Georgia. Plz
ALOHA MOTHERFUCKERS 
Oh crap...Bama looked fierce on that drive.
[deleted]
Tua doing work
Taken out 
RIP Jalen 
They owe the refs like three of those points. 
Missed face mask is not goodThanks refs
I place all of the blame for this on the refs
Completely different team after the half
Holy fucking shit Saban is a genius 
Just because it looks like a vag...
Wow Jalen Hurts on suicide watch 
Yeah but no, Bama fans. Neither offsides or facemask was a big deal in the scheme of things... smh.
Damn he lookin good
Tua = Marcus mariota now
Bama imitating OU's no-huddle offense mode 
WOW IM SO SUPRISED THEY CAN SCORE WHEN YOU SPOT THEM 5 PENALTIES
EAD Georgia. TUA time.
Damn gurl @_@
UGA: 13REFS: 7God fucking damnit.
Welp. Here it is. Hello darkness my old friend 
Benching Hurts was just what the doctor ordered, apparently. Man this new kid is ridiculous
FRESHMEN WERE IN HIGH SCHOOL A YEAR AGO
[Bama](https://media.giphy.com/media/b6iVj3IM54Abm/giphy.gif)
Turning. Point. Guess it was good while it lasted UGA
It's happening.
Benched. 
Taken out
What happened to Hurts?
This is hilarious 3 shit calls and now Bama gets a td
Both of those bullshit calls is going to get us
Goodbye Jalen Hurts
I think Tua truthers have been validated
That ref just noped the ball like it owed him money
Oh boy
That drive looked easy
Holy shit, backup coming in big
I'm feeling the Tua
Holy shit, suck me r/rolltide
LSU FOR REVENGE
Jalen Hurts is gonna have a long, looooong look at his iPhone lock screen tonight.
Momentum completely changed after those bullshit calls. Shit is a joke. 
This looks like.. when that guy switches to his dominant hand in the sword fight
Yeah, I think Hurts has lost his job for good...
This game is complete horse shit
Ok, which school allowed Alabama to recruit a decent QB? That''s straight up unfair.
Fire Saban for not starting this kid and then hire him for starting him at halfThis kid is special 
Hurts just lost his job
I guess the bullshit machine is on
That drive never should have happened in two different ways.
This game turned on a dime or Jalen..
Absolutely gifted to them. Just wow. 
damn 
Hmm i''d say he''s a little better than hurts lmao
I''m fucking sick
I would think as soon as he got benched during the biggest game of his life his career was over at Bama.
Benched
Benched. 
He sucked ass... 
Refs gettin bama back in the game. 
Benched
THANK YOU TUA.  THANK YOU TUA.  THANK YOU TUA.  
Damn shame the refs had to get inject themselves into this game.
It''s like this was their plan all along 
Well things certainly just got interesting. Good luck Georgia. Bama momentum has begun. 
That was easy... watch out Georgia
Jalen Hurts already looking for a new school to transfer to lmaoooo
We have a game again folks
Georgia tech since they don't throw a lot
He sucks at throwing the ball
Why has this kid NOT been starting?!
Aloha
Oh man... It's Tua Time
Yay at least we have a game haha
IN TUA WE BELIEVE
I swear to god if the refs throw this game for Bama i will lose 
roll tide?
Taken out 
Benched because he''s bad
It is if you win 
It would have been more interesting, anyway.I still can't figure out why Lee was benched in the first place.
Damn that freshman is ice fucking cold
Already better than Hurts could imagine ever being.
Oh shit kids
Taken out
Taken out
As a prank
So Bama just has a good QB all of the suddenWhy do I watch this sport?
Should be at least 16-0 rn
We are all fucked 
God dammit 
This seems like a pretty fitting way for Georgia to lose.
What the fuck was that drive?
TUA GOT ME SWEATINYESYESYESYESFUCKING YESTUA
Good job refs
TOUCHDOWN
Hurts can go ahead and apply for that transfer now. 
Tua 4 prez
Taken out 
Pulled
And that kids is how Jalen Hurts transferred from Alabama
Tau looks JUST a bit better than Hurts. 
Damn she was sexy
Cool, refs changed the game
Friendship ended with Hurts. Tua is new Best friend. 
Refs are gonna get what they want. Picked up the flag on holding, tried to give em first down...lol
hahah fuck he's actually gunna do this what teh fuck
We have a game folks!
There is no chance if this continues.
Oh this game is gonna piss me off isn't it
RIP Hurts Job
that was all due to shit officiating. good job.
Tuuuuaaaa
Guaranteed Georgia 3 and out confirmed. Bama has the momentum now.
Refs miss two calls in a row then Bama scores it's almost laughable 
Honestly this is what Bama need is a pocket quarterback. They were at their best with an AJ Mccaron in the pocket and a Julio Jones to run routes and a Mark Ingram in the backfield to power through.
77 tackled the defender on that qb run. No call
Love Hurts
TUA CAN PLAY AT THIS GAME
Saint Nick does it again
God damn it Georgia DON'T RUIN THIS FOR EVERYBODY
Rightfully so he's done.
Truer words have never been spoken 
Urban needs to take note of what changing up your qb can do 
Shutout Memes --> Gets beat by true freshman halftime replacement Memes
RIP Hurts
Saban is a fucking mad genius and Tua has the biggest balls in that entire stadium
IN TUA WE TRUST
God damn put the camera back on that brunette with blue eyes...
True freshman btw
Saban plays the fuck you card.
Taken out.
Saban wised up
Taken out
That's why
Looks good
I miss Jalen Hurts
momentum brought to you by big 10 refs
the refs literally gave them that entire touchdown drive LOOOOOOL
And Hurts will never take another snap at QB for Bama. Could make a hell of a RB though
sup Georgia chick fan
I'm just here for surrender cobra sightings 
Georgia needs to answer.
Oh god, Bama has found their QB.
Where does everyone think Hurts is going to transfer too?
Imagine that giving a team momentum helps them out. Fucking referees 
And now we are getting a football game. 
lol rip jalen hurts
This QB is legit.
Jalen Hurts on suicide watch
Are you kidding me?
Yes so they put in their 5* dual threat QB, just Bama things
well that looked pretty easy.
Not rigged to help Alabama though
Are we witnessing the birth of a legend?
rip in pieces Hurts 
That should have been OUR quarterback :(
Any guesses where Hurts transfers to? 
Wow momentum has changed
Omg that woman. I must find her 
That and the blatant messed up offsides penalty. Ridiculous 
And the offsides penalty
Absolutely robbed. Sorry about our refs 
Coaches Poll still uses it 
Nice touchdown refs
Aw fuck that. 
Jesus Alabama's band sounds ominous as fuck
Oh shit
THAT. WAS. INSANE.
I bet that girl is a freak 
AAAAAAAAAA
Clearly the Dark Lord sacrificed Jalen Hurts at halftime 
Wonder what the background on Tua''s phone is. 
ho boy the bad call on the punt block is definitely going to be the turning point
THE BALLS ON THIS KID 
is it too late to give tua the heisman?
TUA MAN
Georgia you better fucking adjust, no one wants a Bama shared title with UCF. 
Nah that was that QB scramble for the first down that bled some life into the drive.
But they won't show the blown penalty calls
I got the same vibe too
That is incredible.  Your *first* game as a quarterback is the National Championship and you walk down the field to a touchdown.
so this kid is kinda fucking legit
Drink every time someone says True Freshman 
Holy crap... what just happened
Nick Saban is a genius.He let everyone gather film on Hurts all year, secretly grooming this Freshman to be the next All Time Great College Quarterback.
Thank you refs hope you feel good about fucking with a well played game 
The Tide are back in it!**with a little help from the refs.
ALL ABOARD THE TUA TRAIN CHOOOOO CHOOOOO
TUA STAYS 
Poor hurts....put bamas offense on his back and gets fucked out of starting
hey Atlanta it's me a moonshine maker 
Who is this little Asian man playing qb for Bama?
Suddenly he looks great.
Taken out
Couldn''t wrap up on that 3rd & 7. Fuck
Fuck the refs for letting them back in the game
Great. 
BELIEVE 
Happy learned to putt
Jalen hurts
Every ESPN commentator and personality is sweating and worried that Tua is going to be the future of Bama football and having to pronounce that name again and again.
I went from doubting Tua to being convinced he's the second coming of Christ in about 3 minutes
Marcus Mariota is such a nice guy that it only makes sense the world had to balance him out with an evil version that plays at Alabama
Jalen Hurts filing out his transfer papers now. 
Go thank the refs now nick 
Adios Hurts
Oh ffs. If we''re going to make it this easy, we can just pack up and go home. Fuckin hell....!
Hope alive with Tua. 
So you're telling me OU couldn't have done this in the 4th? Damn that play calling still has me mad.
I think he got taken out at halftime Edit: he rushed out to congratulate the other QB. Definitely got taken out I think
Don't worry Alabama, the refs have your back.
Thanks refs!
Hurts must''ve been horse shit. That looked relatively easy after the switch.
uga 13 bama 0 refs 6 the fix is in
REFS REFS REFSUpvotes plz
And LSU still has no QB
haha wtf
omg her eyes
Jalen hurts on suicide watch right now lol
Hello momentum.  Alabama owns you.
Refs 7 dawgs 13 bama 0
The refs have successfully flipped the game. Now go back to not doing this shit.
Friendship ended with Jalen.Tua is my best friend now. 
Refs sure did help em out
OMG JALEN UR GONE!!! TUA IS THE REAL DEAL! 
nicely played refs

Bama driving
SHUTOUT AVOIDED
Benched
It's like they're getting paid per time they say "true freshman"
[OK, he might actually save the day](https://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/7p48fo/game_thread_cfp_ncg_georgia_vs_alabama_8pm_et/dsee0he/)
look who's backkkk
Georgia Sports strike again?
I've been telling my friends for a while now. The offense is entirely different with Tua vs jalen
riding the bench 
Hurts is looking up which FBS schools need starters in two years.
refs changed the game, got to love it
We got a ball game folks
Holy crap that Tagovailoa run.
Tua is about to wreck Georgia lmao 
Overdue for a nice turnover.
Wow. Game just feels a lot different now
He was shit anyways
He got...Jalen Hurts
UGA - 13Refs - 7Bama - 0
The fact that the refs can entirely dictate the flow of a football game, and cannot be held accountable via replay is a farce and misuse of the system.  Seeing refs power trip or simply be wrong is a disservice to everyone involved.
That play at midfield.How did nobody tackle this kid? 
Freshman vs. Freshman for the NCG!
Wow I want them to win for Tua. What a start. 
Canadians already do that I believe 
well, shit.time for georgia to take the same coke they took in the rose bowl
Uhhh....what just happened?
Should be 20-0. Instead we've got a game. Thanks refs. 
Damn that was impressive for a guy taking his first snaps.We got us a game.
Why the hell wasn't this guy starting?!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iy0jnL3NDQ
Taken out
Benched 
Replaced like he should've weeks ago
WE CAN PASS!!!
Its tough being from central ohio and not liking OSU
Refs droppin the ball big time tho 
Well Hurts is looking to transfer
[deleted]
ruh roh
Holy hell what a drive 
... Fuck
Woof woof to that looker
Lol
They thought Hurts was still playing. 
Refs miss two calls in a row then Bama scores it's almost laughable 
How much does it screw with an offense to switch to a lefty qb. I always hear about the ball spinning the opposite way for receivers. But what about play calling being reversed, the o line having the RT blocking the blindside, and any other differences
My stream has gone to shit :(
gg Georgia bros :/
Jaylen is done at bama
R.I.P.
Refs gonna ref. Stole the block and ignored the facemask. Bastards.
This is how Georgia gets robbed by the refs. Holding all over the field. Non-existent facemask. Phantom offsides call on a blocked punt. Sorry Georgia but you're getting hosed. 
RIP Jalen Hurts
Game on
Um tackle bro?
TUA!!!  what's this forward pass trickery?  I like it.  C'mon D.
Taken out
He got Hurts
DID I MENTION HE''S A TRUE FRESHMAN?!
This has all been part of Saban's master plan"Daboll...unleash the Tua""It will be done my lord""Now they shall witness the true power of this fully armed and operational Bama offense"
Mahalo bitches
Saban has been playing a glorified RB at QB all year instead of a competent QB?
Where the fuck did this kid come from? My bash on Bama has been Hurts. This Frosh looks way better.
How, uh, how did Hurts start over this dude? Beginning of season sure, but... wow.
Jalen who now?
Hurts sucks ass. 
Nah, if it happens, it will be that 3rd and 7 conversion.
He was just Hurts
WTF Helfrich! Tua could have basically been an Oregon lock.
Maybe this is tuas dream and we are all just living in it?
If the refs didn''t get their hands on this game it''d still be a shutout 
Damn Bama got momentum fuck me 
RIP Tua transferring rumors.God dammit, Helfrich. I hope you are watching this knowing how bad you fucked up.
This game is rigged as fuck. Goodnight folks 
O N    F I R E
FUCK ALABAMA
As Falcon fan, I''ve seen this movie. IT DOESN''T END WELL
The officiating is horrendous in this game. 
Onside kick. NOW.
Are you guys fucking watching this. OH MY FUCKING GOD.
you don't think anything is fucky after they take away a blocked punt and ignore a facemask so obvious Kirk saw it
Pretty sure he just got benched. And we can see why
This is bullshit
Ouch
Holy fuck Georgia what did you awaken 
Hurts is cut 
Jalen Hurts died for this. 
I've lost all respect sorry this is absolutely rigged for money... Or ratings in not sure which. I won't be silent . Just saw it live sry.
unrelated, but hilarious username
Jesus, fuck ESPN and their shitty stream with a rusty spoon.
you can tell the commentators wanted that so badly
Saban must've seen my last comment. Still tons of time but that felt like a huge game changing drive.
I'm glad Bama seems to have realized they're not going to get points with FGs.
Drink! 
I like all those bands. And I like them a lot.But most 16 year olds don't know those bands (and nobody of any age wants to listen to recent Axl Rose.) They might know a song or two, but in general those bands are meaningless to them. And 16 year olds are the target demographic here.I don't know your age, but lets put it like this. Nirvana and Elvis are both awesome and popular, but 16 year olds in the early 90s cared about one and not the other. Kendrick Lamar is a very talented and popular rapper.And that's before we get to the problem of there aren't many new rock bands capable of selling out an arena.
Refs completely changed the direction of this game. It''s obviously not rigged but man I wish I could have a game not ruined by refs. 
Those bad calls changed the entire game. 
Tua can play!
Nice blown calls by the refs saved Bama 
Oh cat shit u/FLIP_AII_DAY
Tua 
SABAN IS PLAYING 4D CHESSS!! HE KNEW KIRBY WOULDNT STUDY TUA!!!
Like I said... I think Saban made the ultimate halftime adjustment 
Jalen Hurts might want to start thinking about where he wants to transfer to
The balls on Saban. 
holding on four or five plays, no face mask, no false start. no blocked punt. unreal
Calling it now, Bama scores 28 unanswered points
Alright, I don''t care what jersey he''s wearing, if a true freshman comes in at halftime to lead a natty winning comeback, I''m gonna enjoy it.
Bad tackling!
Tua Tagovailoa for Heisman?
Feels damn good RTR win or lose
Fuck Bama, but Tua is good tho.
Basically and bama has been hiding Mariota 2.0 all year
*ref is new best friend
In my experience you stand a really good chance at winning a title when you throw in a QB with limited experience and game film for opposing coaches to study.
They just had to tackle him on 3rd and 7...
Hawaii reppin !!! 808 boiz
THIS SOME TIM DONAGHY SHIT
Why can't they just lose sigh
ohhh shit. TUAAAAA
NEXT!
To USF
Fuck these fucking refs. If you call one penalty only, you call the fucking face mask. It's player safety 101
Laaaaaaaaaaame
Alabama just turned down all the sliders before that drive. Too easy for them. 
Whole new ball game
B1G refs do not call holds
He's the rich man's Jeremiah Masoli.
Tua made that look so fucking easy and he stayed calm the whole drive. Like he''d been playing all season 
Oh god no pleass
WhatThe FuckSaban, the fucking madman 
Alabama touchdown courtesy of the refs
FUCKKKK too easy
Hands to the face on #5?
Saban is a God.
YOU DAWGS ARE IN TROUBLE NOW. THE KID IS A STUD
Tua just like “fuck it I got this”
Noice
Saban's secrit play
Alabama should have been playing this guy the whole season, every game I watched with Jalen he looked lost.
Jalen HurtsGot benched 
No just bad at qb
Damn that UGA fan was hot af
He's left handed too 
Fuck fuck fuck fuck
That would've been a great drive if the refs hadn't gifted them it. Not Bama's fault, and I try very hard not to pull the ref card, but the officiating to start this half is undeniably awful.
Remember when the refs let Bama back in?
Kid looks like Russel Wilson out there to me
Damn, this kid can ball. 
Are we supposed to know who this guy is?
[deleted]
Goodbye Jalen Hurst. We hardly knew ye
Damn I hate Bama but love Tua
Refs missed a lot but at the end of the day, Georgia has to wrap him up and none of this happens
Holy shit. Just marched down the field like it was against Mercer
holy shit they are chanting Tua, this is fucking insane.
wow.too fucking easy 
Lets go baby
SHEEEEEESH
Was hurts just benched or injured?
Okay, so, I'm pretty drunk and was distracted by AGDQ, did Hurts get benched or injured?EDIT: Instead of replying to you all, I'll just say thanks here
Uh ho. Dawgs better watch out. Tua is slinging it!
Neither can I fam, but Tua is balling right now.
/r/watchpeoplegetfired bye jalen
Tua seems to be handling this language barrier pretty well /s
"No foul, Bama is awarded 3 automatic first downs" these shitty refs probably
So what a are some landing spots for Jalen? Serious question. 
Well fuck. 
Bye bye hurts
Alright, we got a ballgame now
Oof
If he was that much better why is he just now starting
No way in hell he''s a starter in that uniform again
Alabama fans can write thank you letters to the ref crew
Y''all act like Hurts is irreplaceable or something. He honestly isn''t that good. Probably saw the last of him going forward. 
Thanks refs
Jesus....what a twist
Livin' on Tua Time. 
wow my stream is such shit, is Jalin Hurts out?
Fuck the Refs. 
Rip Hurts
I'm gonna cry if Georgia loses. Not because I'm a fan, but because I have $50 and nude run through the neighborhood on it.
Pretty much yea. Although in his defense (which is shoddy at best) the O-Line barely gave him ANY room whatsoever. 
Handed them all the momentum in the world
Refs fucked us as always 
you're behind dog
This game got turned on it head. Georgia needs to respond with points.
“Tua throws a pick six”, ref: first down Alabama!
Holy crap, it's like an entirely different offense.
Malcolm parish is a liability 
Oh shit Tua is left handed? Ok I'm a bama fan now. 
Sorry UGA, that is not ideal for your chances. Is Kirby Darth Maul or Darth Vader?
ITS TUA TIME BABY
Saban part of the deep state confirmed. 
fuck yeah Tua lets go
Saban made the correct call.
What a drive!
[deleted]
NICK SABAN IS PLAYING 4D CHESS. HE PLAYED HURTS THIS ENTIRE SEASON JUST TO BLUFF THEIR PASSING GAME FOR THE CHAMPIONSHIP
"Where does that come from?" It comes from refs preventing Bama from getting nail in the coffin turnovers. It comes from refs intending to call holding on Bama's line and then picking up the flag without an explanation. 
JUST. LIKE. THAT. IT IS ALL OVER!
He rides!
How do you get flair
"There is no flag for the blatant holding. Result of the play is first down. Huh? It's not a first down? Oh well, just ignore the holding on the next play too."
Every Georgia sports fan knoes how this ends. Its not going to feel good.
take a sip every time they say true freshman. see you in the ER boys 
Hey look. Alabama's busses finally got to the stadium. Damned Atlanta traffic.
SABAN WAS RIGHT MOTHERFUCKERS 
3 straight completions to Ruggs. Freshman to freshman. Lmao
COME ON TUA
You cheat thats how. Im sorry bama but the refs didnt call one penalty on you guys when u had 3 blatant holds.  Ur bullshit and im not even a dogs fan
Refs 7Dawgs 13
Tua looked better on that drive than Hurts has at any point in his career.
These guys are quality QBs playing in the championship as freshmen.I was failing Anthro 101 as a freshman, what the fuck man
UGA needs to have a parade and hang a banner for 2017 First Half National Champions
ya can't let someone with 0 meaningful experience carve you up like that if you want to win a championship georgia
So I guess we''re having bama vs Georgia for the next 4 national titles 
TUA-EZ
He made that look so easy. Jalen Hurts must be really bad
This is what is going to happen to Fromm next year. Hopefully UGA gets the title for him on his way out.
That's exactly what the advertisers wanted
When the refs give you a second chance at the punt and ignore the facemask. :/
I think Saban just killed the young sith, and brought up a new one. Death star marches on....
TUA IS GONNA BREAK THIS THREAD
That's the Kirby we know. Freshman quarterback? Let's just sit back on our heels and let him gain some confidence....
Iron Bowl?
Those two missed calls are huge now.
That girl was hot
Shit tackling just cost us 7 points, wtf.  Also I wonder why that flag was picked up when it was against Bama.
ALOHA BITCHES!
Well at least he''s lefty. Can''t not root for a fellow lefty 
Wow it's a football game. Hurts is gonna transfer 
Bamas mvp are the refs...
So where does Hurts transfer?
TUUUUAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!
Those three guys missing that sack on third down could be the play that defines this game. Fuck.
All because three Dawgs couldn't manage to tackle on that 3rd down sack. 
If Bama wins this shit should have an * next to it. Absolutely blatant favoritism 
The refs just happened.
They were indeed just saying that.
Ouch
Tua about to pull a Fromm and Eason Hurts out of a job
And so it begins....
Jalen Hurts has a future in the NFL. As a RB.
#ASIAN PRIDE
Lol
What a huge third down scramble
Because he sucks
Thanks refs 
Press F to pay respects to Jalen Hurts.I think I'm doing it right. Memes that is. 
Man, Tua is clearly the superior quarterback. 
big ten refs score!
This is like the opposite of the plot in Friday Night Lights where JT McCoy gets benched for Saracen in the championship game.
Bye bye, Hurts
There were at least 2 holds every play that drive. Bullshit
C''mon dawgs. Please.
I like Jalen, I really do.. but man, that drive was nice. Freshman to Freshman. Has me excited for the next 3 years
T R U E F R E S H M A N
Fucking referees.
Refs sure are clutch tonight
Refs gave Bama that one. Picking up flags for them and no calls. Ridiculous 
Hurts is gonna transfer.
Never question the Dark Lord Saban.
Georgia WAS NOT expecting Tua. 
Bama is going to win 3 more championships with this freshman... fuck
90ish yards of offense in the first half probably
Yeah the refs only fucked Georgia twice to change the momentum. 
Seattle (where I'm drinking it). One of the better breweries in WA right now
I . . . Hurt myself . . . today . . . To see if I still feel . . .
Thanks, Refs. GG Bama
Guys it''s fine, Georgia just needs to eat a Scooby snack and also make these refs disappear.
Tua "jimmy garoppolo" Tagovaila
Boy, those people defending Hurts got really quiet, really fast.
This kills the Hurts. 
who the fuck is this kid, and why was he behind Hurts?
LETS FUCKING GO BAMA!!
WE'VE BEEN SAYING IT ALL GAME
[deleted]
Remember when UGA should have had a first down on that obvious facemask?
This is bullshit man
Throw Jalen in there as a flex/RB
Just cut my Dick off if Alabama fucking wins
Tua looks poised as hell. 
I have the most of erect of erections right now. Roll fucking Tide.
Press F to pay respect to Jalen Hurts' starting position
Looking forward to Jalen Hurts being Michigan's transfer starter in 2020
Looks like 14 gave up
This kills the Bulldog.
TUA TIME HAS BEGUN.
LET'S FUCKING GO
....can confrim
Mack Brown disagrees though.
Tua just stole jalens job in one series
Tua is going Mayfield right now.
i hate that all the tua apologists were right.but also ROLL TIDE.
It was too much rugby style tackle 
taken out
You mean what a way for the refs to ruin a game?
Are these refs not allowed to call any penalties on Alabama? 
Marcus Mariota 2.0 has entered the game. 
C L A S S
I do now! 
I swear if this game hinges on the blown false start on the blocked punt and subsequent missed facemask call as the momentum shifter...
How big is that stolen punt block now?
Crooked Crimson Tide paid the refs for totally FAKE CALLS.  Sad!
fuck 
But muh screen saver
What the fuck was that third down
And jalen hurts can't do shit with these weapons lol. He should call it quits with his college career. 
These dummies played Hurts ALL year.
IS TUA ELITE?
I''m really glad they played Hurts against us this year.
And bama wins
here it comes...
I heard the Vitruvian Man actually had a megadong but da Vinci made it smaller because he felt inadequate
I'm going back to watching pro wrestling. it's less fixed than this.
this is some bullshit officiating lmao 
Saban needs to go thank the refs for that score
Wonder how much the refs got paid at halftime 
who the fuck is this guy
Well. That momentum sure shifted quick. 
This is rigged
We need to somehow, someway blow this game out of the damn water. 17+. OR those two missed calls are talked about for an entire year.
[deleted]
Tua is the truth and the future.
SOME of us having been saying this since last year, only to get trashed. 
The horrible tackling and coverage was caused by the refs?
because it go them to a national championship lol
Welp, no more Jalen. Now I see why the Bama fans wanted Tua in all season. 
2 penalties 
Tua made it look sexy
The decision to put Tua in will go down in Alabama legend if they end up winning 
This offense looks absolutely different with a quarterback who can throw.Georgia wasn't prepared. 
Still impressed that he escaped that pressure for the first down run. He was dead and buried in the backfield
Saban playing 8D chess with this QB swap.
Georgia football teams are *really* good at fucking things up. 
Fuck Helfrich and co. for not going after Tua.
Classic fucking georgia
Well that was sweet. 
Well it also helps when said quarterback can truck LBs harder than Tebow
Coutesy of big 10 refs
I kind of agree.
Hurts leads his team to two championship games as a frosh then soph, and this dude won't have a job next season.
Goddammit Helfrich
Well shit. There goes the shutout.
Apology for poor English.When were you when Hurts died?I was sat at home when Satan ring.'Hurts is kill''no'
The touchdown drive that never should have been.
Bama with a legit passing game? They may never lose again
In B4 Hurts transfers to Michigan to compete with Shea Patterson 
Great, now Saban is a genius for unveiling the "secret weapon." 
Going to be hard to beat Alabama with these refs. Completely fucking up right now.
Those Georgia fans were shook
TUA IS THE REAL ONE
Wahhhh
Career defining moment... Hate Bama, quite happy for that kid currently
At least y'all weren't up 28-3.
Here's already played in a game
Where did this kid come from?
True Freshman. Wow. STONES. 
wow... why was jalen hurts in for the first half... wow
Benched him for throwing like shit
You''re at the game?
Just in! Bama to win next 4 years. Jalen to FAU.
That was a gorgeous spiral good god
You better not be a flash in the pan. You have the mantle of Steve Young to carry.
Put me in coach.
Too late, already wasted this season.
We might need another 3rd quarter thread, the Tua hype is too real.
Refs gift wrapped that one
You can thank the refs, Bama
Looks like Hurts needs to stay on the bench 
Georgia fans should be infuriated right now, fuck these refs
Why haven't they been playing this kid? Not that I'm complaining...
Hurts complimenting the dude who just stole his job lol 
dat kid good
GG
Georgia salt intensifying. Relax dawg bros, still plenty of football.
I think the missed offsides call changed it.  That could have put Georgia up 13 with the ball on the 15.  Could have made it a 3 score game.
And you people thought Saban wouldn't sacrifice a goat at halftime.Shit is over.
And Jalen Hurts is apparently an awesome person.
Friendship ended with Hurts.Tua is my new best friend 
Certainly not the first time people have counted Alabama out after the first half.Wouldn't be the first time they spoke too soon either. 
This 
Hurts might as well announce his intent to transfer on twitter before the 4th quarter starts
ALOHA
Well Tua... that was legit
Tua is doingnit but there was a missed holding call on his scramble. I can''t help but feel these refs are tipping towards Bama right now
Get two HUGE breaks and get a touchdown 
Georgia 13, Refs 7. We gotta game
I swear to god, if Bama wins on this collection of chicken shit calls...
Oh hey, Alabama has an offense again!
These refs suck
Got a game again
Its the OJ Howard ploy against Clemson 2.0
Fuuuuuuuuuuuck man we're gonna have to watch this kid tear up the SEC for the next couple of years. 
holy shit, where has Ruggs been all year?
I don't know how anyone can claim there's no Bama bias with a straight face.
Yes
Amazing how one TD swings everything.
Did the refs just throw that TD?
Based on the admittedly small sample size how could he not?
Nah dude. He played plenty of garbage time/mop up minutes this year. 
Apparently after being up two possessions the NCAA decided to up the difficulty and make UGA play against two teams in the second half. 
Lmao fucc
Y''all acting like Hurts is mad. Psh. Hurts is a true Bama player, first one out there to congratulate Tua. 
Black Tim Tebow has come to play 
Not calling false starts, facemasks, or holds.
Pick play on the game winning touchdown in 2016.
He could triple option well.
Gifted great field position out if fucking nothing. Lets be real here.
So looks like someone is transferring out of Alabama next season... 
That drive hurts Jalens chances of returning 
"I'm gonna post a comment about how the conspiracy theorists need to stop. Alabama is not getting back in this game. A freshman QB? Psh"-me 5 minutes ago.
wouldnt you take him out too?
The block at least was clear as day. He was a good two yards offsides. 
Benched
Well... where is Hurts transferring to?
God damn you, Mark Helfrich. God damn you to hell. 
Bomani Jones just pointed it out, this is the final game Jalen Hurts starts for Alabama after that touchdown
What does Hurts change his phone background to now that he got benched?
Anyone know what year any of these players are?
can't wait for Tua to win this and us never hear the end of it to the point of him winning the Heisman next year despite having average stats much like Derek Henry
classy fucking move by hurts, he's good people
OH SWEET JESUS THANK YOU.
"We welcome new Michigan Wolverine, QB Jalen Hurts!"
I literally can't watch the friggin national championship.  On a legitimate stream.
Bad calls are part of football, can't let them define the game.
How do the refs fuck up so badly back to back for Georgia? They just helped Bama get back in this game 
Could someone please photoshop me an Alabama logo and use the “A” to spell “Almost” in a similar fashion to OU spelling “OUt” that my Bama buddy sent me on Facebook? TIA!
benched
all kinds of blown calls leading to a game-changing drive. Shame that bad officiating helped put Bama back into the game.
Bama illicits the same feelings as the pats. They can be down but you know they gonna win. 
IS ANYONE NOT IMPRESSED BY THIS KID?  NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP, FRESHMAN, THROWN IN THERE. HE THROWS WITH AUTHORITY. HOLY MOLY!!!
Georiga, if y''all lose it''s because I brought out my Bulldogs coozie that I stole before the Prayer in Jordan Hare game
So.That's a True or Redshirt freshman?
Are you sure about that?
stfu, ill kill myself if that happens
I wish Garrett Gilbert played like this
3rd and 7.
Come on dawgs. Take our H8 to feed on
Some of these commercial breaks have been insane. During one in the first half I actually checked that I was still on the right channel.
Take away the four uncalled holds and they probably do.
Maybe... Just maybe... Nick fucking Saban knows what he's doing.
UCF 31
He got benched
All they need to do is just run a pick play.
I HATE TO CORRECT YOU, BUT WE LOST THAT ROSE BOWL. IN FACT, WE HAVE NEVER WON A ROSE BOWLWE ALSO HAVE NEVER GONE 0-12
Oh fuck... Saban benches his QB in the NC?Balls the size of melons
Kinda feel for Jalen right now. Lose Nat'l Champ, get back next year, suck all first half, get benched, replacement gets TD. All on National TV. Ouch. 
Switching to a freshman QB at halftime of the National Championship, *just Saban things*
This is like when Inigo Montoya switched to his right hand in the Princess Bride 
Fuck the refs that offside and face mask was so pivotal
Ruggs out of nowhere to top AL receiver in the game!
MY BODY IS READY
this is honestly peak Saban 
WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON
Pro koon
Pro-Jalen Bama fans are deceased
That might have been a better drive than I have ever seen from Hurts. Not that I watch every Alabama game, but still. That was nice. 
So much for sleeping tonight
This Tua guy is pretty good 
[How people blaming the refs look](https://i.imgur.com/A0dhKim.jpg)
Hawaii
He got beat on every play of that drive.
Juco
Fuck I'm gonna need to find a new username
Jalen Hurts transfer sweepstakes in 3..2..1...
Omg ESPN it's 2018....why is your stream so shity? 
Fuck Star Wars I like The moneypit
RIP Georgia 
As well as the offsides and facemask no call. 
Hawaii
That could be something alright
Benched. 
Jalen Hurts sorry fam go ahead transfers lol
*saban mouths thank you at refs* 
This is the beginning of the end for Jalen Hurts
now we gotta play this dude for 3 years fuck
Major refball
“Hurts sucks straight ass, but let''s not forget what a man of high moral character he is.”    —ESPN
F U REFS
Goes from blocked kick, GA in scoring territory to this... Thanks refs
Rip Jalen Hurts 
FUCK BF2
Take your damn upvote.
Thanks refs!
Yeah but not injured. Just pulled.
Happy learned how to putt
Wait a minute, did a Georgia team just come out of halftime with a lead?
He got Hurts ... if you will...*NOTE: I don't really know. I just wanted you to know you missed a chance at this joke. 
lol
yeah to juco
Thanks for the memories Jalen. 
I'm not drunk enough
If you show the Georgia logo in neutral colors it looks like the packers logo 
Jalen Hurts has lost control of the Alabama QB depth chart
Good drive boys 
Why? Hurts is a RB
To rb of wideout hopefully 
Ok. This is a whole new team we are playing. Gotta regroup
Nah
"The energy has changed a lot."Thanks refball.
> quarterback duellet's not get ahead of ourselves Chris Fowler
Georgia, why are you doing this to us?
Called back blocked punt, no facemask, no holds.
he got fired :/
His couch 
Yeah, this might be Tua's team now....
Alabama's not going to get shut out, so the refs can relax now.
go ahead and thank the refs on that one Bama
how old is Tua?
Praise Tua.  At least we might have a game now.
Ya, looks like the refs (or their friends) have a lot of money riding on this game.
Hurts is such a good dude but damn Tua is the better QB for this offense. 
Or not. Ok offense, you. Have. To. Answer. Give the defense time to rest and figure out what the hell happened and how to fix it, and put more points on the board to keep a lead. Get the momentum back, offense. 
Hey guys we got a new Star Wars movie coming out soon!
im so hard right now. No way uga prepped for Tua time
Like, one series doesn't make a QB. But also... Dude was out of his brain
Bama successfully running a spread offense with a qb with an arm is scary
Lol no
Benched
Tua is going to be scary as he develops 
Refs paid off, enjoy your bullshit Alabama .
Fuck me Tua daddy
Plus 31 for UCF 
hell, at this point i'm just surprised they didn't find a way to call a personal foul against georgia on that non-call facemask...
I could see this lol. It is Atlanta 
From 20 -3 to 13-7
Where were you when Jalen Hurts is kill?I was sitting at home on couch watching National Commercial Championship when roommate call."Jalen is kill""no"
Ruh roh
He looks like a fucking genius now
If he pulls out a win for Alabama here, I can''t see them putting Hurts back in ever. He was downright awful the first half.
Gotta be his stupidest decision he made as head coach. The kid was begging to be recruited by us....
well, changing OC's sure didn't seem to do anything.
The offense looks immensely better though... 
Is he Asian? 
Endless respect for Jalen Hurts for running out to Tua right there. 
YESSSS. Tua thank you my sweet Polynesian god. 
Ok so Dawgs put Eason in?
Feel bad for Jalen Hurts. 
Nah Bama should still get 7. But refs also have 7 
Anyone's guess
DABOTAKE FUCKING NOTESIF THE QB BLOWS REPLACE HIM
 Last thing fans around the country want to hear is “Alabama...true freshman to true freshman”
Jesus Christ watchespn can''t stream for shit
All those bad/missed calls from the refs come to fruition for Alabama.
help
This is the first time I've looked at this sub tonight, anyone make a "Hurts to Michigan" joke yet? 
GOGGLES VS KRAKA TUA!
I don't know if he can win em the game but at least its entertaining now
RIP Hurts
I just realized the UGA logo looks a lot like the Green Bay one
Refs called in the fix 
S A L T
Why are you watching this? You can't win. #THWG
Oh... Would you look at that... Another 3 years of dominance for Bammer with this kid... Shocker. 
Bama is going to win this with the back up. Sheesh, guess Hurts is gone after this year 
Saban just starting a RB at QB for the lulz until he needs an actual QB. 
Bitch about the refs all you want... that score is on an utterly pathetic excuse for tackling on third down at midfield.  Idiotic play has let them back into this.
Pro threat
Not when he's taking pictures :-)
Drive should have ended on that third down, blind stupid refs.
Missed the first several minutes of the 3rd quarter, I see a lot of complaints about the refs. What did I miss? (Or what did the refs miss?)
Wait, what happened to Jalen?
And a wrongly overturned punt block. And a missed facemask. Few others...
Cleveland.
keep this up young man and you'll someday play for the Browns
i blame helfrich for this
I know we're poking fun at UCF for claiming the NC, but I have no doubt they could have hung with any of these teams this week or last. Honestly Clemson lost to Syracuse and didn't deserve their slot.
Fuck... with the way Tua is playing, I can''t help but wonder what his screen saver has been for the past year.
JustBamaThings
It was false start anyway. But keep crying. 
Henry had amazing stats. Dude had like 27 rushing TDs
Right!
Gonna delete?
So Hurts is done as Bama''s QB now right? 
Welp, it was fun while it lasted.
Say with me now... FUCK EA!
Um excuse me, where has this little shit been all season?
Hurts better find a new position or transfer.
If Only Urban put in Haskins over that trash JT
Yes they did
How? Very intentionally. Fuck Bama. Fuck the refs.
Kirby Smart - Why are you smiling?Nick Saban - Because I know something you don''t know. I... am not left handed!
True freshman to true freshman. He's a true freshman. Did you hear? True freshman. 
lol ref gives them 1st down start the conspiracy theories
Can you guys put him back on the bench now?
Here lies Hurts career 2016-2018 press f to pay your respects
Bama just got pissed off and went Super Hawaiian.  I'm scared.
IN TUA WE TRUST
he doesn't seem to be as fast but he's def agile
Look it''s Marcus Mariotwo
I'm shocked Alabama didn't hold once on that drive
lol fuck you take my upvote
Auburn? 
Downvoted til i got the reference 
Alabama fans straight ignoring all the missed calls lol
That was terrible.
Everyone thinks hurts is good because he''s surrounded by 5* players and has run over everyone else basically 
Georgia getting fucked with molasses lubricant by the officials this half. I'd be furious if I was a UGA fan.
Need me a hot star wars gamer gf
Jesus Christ. Sorry UGA
I'm all about this kid. Cinderella story. I love Bama now. 
Change of pace. Tua is a better passer.
Yes. And Tua just came in and picked UGA apart. 
He's got cross eyeblack. No way man!
So I''m not sure, is he a true freshman QB?
I''m very much woke to the fact that Nick Saban purposefully put his team in a halftime deficit for the bulletin board material 
mini left handed tom brady with 4.4 speed
*finally scores one touchdown halfway into the game*"ALABAMA IS BACK INNIT"like come on homie at least wait until they get double digits 
I mean... pretty sure Georgia wasn't prepared for a Bama QB that could actually throw
Bama's oline looks like a brick wall right now.
This wouldn''t be so scary if we hadn''t just gotten cheated out of at least 3 points by the refs. 
Yup you are. F
Because tuas a better thrower 
I thought he was from Hawaii 
COULD SOMEBODY TELL ME WHY HURTS IS OUT PLEASE?! I''ve asked like 5 different people.
..... dont get us started
Refs with the pulp fiction epipen
I heard one of them is a freshman possibly.
Yeah dislocated neck bone. Back up just came in  and threw a pick six for a Bama touchdown. Very rare play
This is one of the first times I''ve ever been legitimately tilted at refereeing.
Refs fuck up twice, new Bama QB does some magic, UGA can''t defend all of a sudden. Bama back in it. Fuck this.
Holy fuck.  That drive was absolute BEAST MODE by TUA.  Kid is going to special, believe that.  
We know. Anyone who has actually been watching Bama play should know
If ya'll would have tackled him they wouldn't have scored
UCLA?
Benched 
Peach Bowl last week.
Refs bailing out Bama big time right now.
As someone who was using my parents'' cable account to stream WatchESPN, I''m genuinely glad that I spent the $20/month for the 4 months of the CFB season to get slingtv. I''m not affiliated with them at all, but I can say that the lags and glitches happen SIGNIFICANTLY less in my experience with the latter
Nah
Missed the plays, what were the two calls the refs fucked up
Eddie would go!
He's played in 8 other games.
Tua is a true freshman as are several receivers for Bama
Happy for the kid, but the refs have fundamentally changed this game. 
hard to maintain a lead when you combine getting screwed on huge calls with a newfound inability to tackle
"Yes, hello? Tua is it you? 'Tis your future calling, the Browns!"
Jesus fuckin Christ refs 
Needs to go to a triple option team.
This checks out. 
He should be Alabama's running back next season and run option/Wild Cat shit alongside Tua.
Looks like it's working out this year. 
1. Blocked punt was undeservedly overturned.  2. Critical Georgia 3rd down face mask penalty was missed.  3. Flag for holding penalty on critical Bama 3rd down picked up.  
Sorry Georgia, refs keeping Bama in the game that drive. 
have you not been excited for these past 10 years
FRIENDSHIP WITH JALEN OVER. NOW TUA IS MY BEST FRIEND.
Is this what Oklahoma felt like last week?
Yes
Georgia's response here decides this game. If there's no response, the death star is on full rampage
I predict Hurts is done at QB for Bama. Not just this game, but forever. Think he'll be RB next year?
What the fuck is your flair situation. (I say this knowing fully well that I'm about 70 miles off from having the same flair)
I mean, it does. That''s going to hurt if we come up short. 
hell half the fanbase has been screaming for it all season
Thank the refs 
Next year is going to be fun. ( LSU fan :'(    )
Where is Jalen Hurts transferring to?
RIP Jalen "Mr. Clutch" Hurts
The refs gave Bama a free TD to keep the crowd interested
Where Steve Young Jr. come from all of a sudden?
And here teams from Georgia go choking again.
They will, you already know it''s going to happen. 
The refs.

Jalen Hurts just declared for the draft
Refs making shit happen though... 
The change he needed!!!
False freshman
Jalen Hurts is a better man than me. I'd be like. God Dammit I'm going to have to transfer schools.
Game over. Refs missing blatant calls and georgia choking
You can blame the refs all you want but you just let a rookie who hadn't play a single snap all season march the ball down your freaking throats without so much as a howdy do
it worked for us against you guys a coupe years ago
Can you save that for juju purposes for us? 
2 ah
As both a Georgia and Falcon fan same. 
It's bama, those aren't missed calls.  They're tribute.
No shit
So where is Hurts transferring to next year?
NCAA 2005 Update: I didn't fuck around with the playcalling on my second chance so I scored another TD + 2 pt. combo to put the Gators up 19-0 with 3:48 left in the game. I'm totally playing the next game to keep the updates going
Finally! 
He'll go the Braxton Miller route, hopefully.
At least they didn't shut the lights off like the super bowl a few years ago
And also that blocked a punt that was wrongly called back. And also a blatant facemask that would've been an automatic first down just wasn't called. 
Clap...clap...clap...nicely done
He was bein ass
Hurts is a team player. Don't hate.
Where can we get some more of dem... Freshman QBs?
Anyone else having clarity issues with the WatchESPN app? Been doing fine all season and really fucking up tonight
The fix is in.
They''re so pumped now lol. 
How can you have Tua apologists when he was never given a chance?
That would be the only way that LSU passing attack could get worse lol.
Man I'd be so pIssed if some girl shot up my apartment with her AT-AT.Also how the fuck did she get an AT-AT?
buttcheeks starting to clench in Georgia
Hurts just ran out there and congratulated him. This had to be in the game plan. 
We gotta make adjustments. Alabama was just gifted that drive, but can''t let that be an excuse now.
I love Jalen. I Stood behind him in a concession line once. But my god TT is sooooo much better 
Hurts isn't a good enough QB to start anywhere else after a transfer IMO
Now we can play balanced football.  ROLL TIDE!!!!!
QB and WR on that touchdown are true freshman 
That's not the Clemson I know.
Boy that bad call on the blocked punt and the missed face mask are looming large now. That's a damn shame.
Imagine if Jalen ends up forcing himself back out there or some shit.
WhydoesAlabamaalwayspullwinsandgoodplaysoutof theirass?
Wide receiver

benched cause trash
... he can''t keep getting away with it!
Hope bama enjoys the refs claiming a title for them.
HURTS GUNNA TRANSFER THAT ASS OUTTA TUSCALOOSA 
Tua the truth?
Dude.
Saban got inspired by Kendrick's performance, told him to sit down and be humble.
Georgia was prepared for one QB, but not *Tua*?
Wisconsin here he come don''t @ me
Yes
Happy learned how to play the refs
Can't overstate how big those two missed calls were
Well, what do we have here?
Saban's genius literally creates points from nothing.
Quicker than u can say Tua Tagavaloaloalahsixhsgfj
My God that little Polynesian has ice in his veins
Defensive schemes gonna have to change.  Tua carved the defense up.
Kirby be like, “fuck, the waterboy is in!”
So Tagavailoa #1 pick in a few years?
This is why I didn't understand having Hurts back there. Hurts is good but Bama have always had success with a pocket quarterback to make throws. This guy can run too every now and then which is a bonus.
or a new flair
benched 
WatchESPN stream goes out right before touchdown thanks espn
Put in Jalen Hurts at TE.
Refs + Tua = trouble
Is this real life?   What a momentum switch..
Jalen seems like a good guy
It's like us with Wimbush and Book lol
What did Helfrich do?
Sports are so predictable. The golden team starts losing and the refs do everything they can to bring them back. I really hate it sometimes. 
Yeah
That missed sack was a killer, stop fuckin tackling high 
Holy crap where did this baller came from???
Face mask and false start I'll give you. They were obvious af. Holds are a lot more questionable. ESPECIALLY 4 or 5...come on. maybe 1.
I'm scared for the future now.
Lmao they made it to the ship though. Morons!
Benched
True
Refs missing holding actually affects the play. Sorry
Praise the B1G?
Maybe he and Dan Mullen can get together. 
Ok
Wait until he throws a pass to himself and provides a block for a first down
crazy to think how good this bama team could have been if they started the guy who could actually throw all season lol
Yes. :(
Imagine this situation 8+years from now
Yep. That was an impressive drive.
These refs are T R U E   F R E S H M E N
If this dude keeps it up, he's literally going to get so much that his dick will break in half. How is he supposed to live through 3 more years of college.
That QB's name sounds like a fancy pasta dish
Hurts you were good.ThanksITS TUA TIME DOE
[deleted]
bad reffing =/= biasThe game isn't rigged. Come on
Big Balls Saban
Which one?
Benched as far as I know. 
So we don't get any more teams that don't win their divisions in the playoff.  I don't care if it's Bama.
these refs make big 12 refs look good
After seeing that girl, I think I just dedicated my life to the Georgia Bulldogs
Ahem. I will gladly take jalen hurts if he considers transferring 
The ire of bought refs. 
Unbelievable. Georgia blocks a punt and the refs botch the call. Bama gets away with it. Georgia gets a facemask in front of two refs, no call. Bama gets away with it. Then this new QB literally evades 3 defenders and runs for an impossible first down. Next thing we know, Bama scores. They get away with everything
This game was going pretty good from officiating stand point. Then second half starts and it's tainted the game. If bama wins everyone will blame the refs.
This kid is nuts. I'm honestly excited to see how good he is a few years from now.
Just sitting here wondering when these Bama holds are going to get called, if ever.
He can't throw
You think the refs would call it?
Benched 
Yes, at half 
That''s some real reffy reffing
So a false start that gets called an offsides on the punt, a missed facemask that was obvious, and then a picked up flag on a hold... hmm... 
KAMEHAMEHA MOTHERFUCKERS
Freshman, not sure though. The Herb needs to confirm for me
Cause he''s trash
he was not offsides LOL. are we watching the same game?
What''s rpo in Hawaiian 
I made this account after the vanderbilt game. I regret nothing.
Tua seems way better than Hurts. They should've put him in earlier.
Its 13-7 lol
"That is my answer to that question."
I know many coaches have switched QBs during the game (just take a look at the flair) but man that's gutsy to switch at halftime of the National Championship. Granted Jalen was playing pretty poorly.A bunch of freshmen stepped up big that drive for Bama. 
[removed]
Nah...that's ok.
Also not a Georgia fan or even SEC fan. Refs definitely changed the game for Bama, and it looks almost certainly blatant and purposeful. Fuuuuuuck Bama
More football with intelligent commentary? Mind = blown.
Man I wish this was how Alabama's offense played all the time. I could get on that bandwagon. Gridiron football wins games but this is fun.
Dawgnabbit!
Naw, FAU- going to join Kiffin.
Sorry, I meant TD drive before the half. The play where Godwin ran out of bounds on his own. No flags were thrown.
Saban had a Wild Card with Tua... bet the Georgia defense didn't scheme vs a left handed Russell Wilson 
Remember the real Battlefront II? Such a great game.
So it's decided, if Bama wins, UCF are the true champs.
how do you hand a team a touchdown? Apparently by letting them "play football" 
Oh he''s transferring.
As a Falcons fan, I too have seen this film.
that's THE FAU to you
Thanks, Wisconsin. 
Benched
wtf there's blue skittles now
Crock-Pot if Georgia doesn't respond
That man would sacrifice a child if he needed to. 
I dunno but does the Georgia QB and Bama QB know each other from somewhere?
He was horrible. Had 21 yards in the first half
Must have got benched
I know and his throw is even weirder.
I just wanna hear Alabama fans pronounce Tagovailoa. 
Oh you sweet summer child...
Benched
No injuries he wasn''t throwing the ball well. 
Sorry, I meant TD drive before the half. The play where Godwin ran out of bounds on his own. No flags were thrown.
Tua is Duan it!
It was in in the first play of the game where Hurts had a stiff arm turned facemask that the refs ignored.
He ain''t doing too good 
Couldn''t score any points 
Hold on tight!! 
Lol why did they play Hurts all year?
He sucked first half 
Getting fucked over by calls?
Benched
We just watched Hurts lose the starting job in real time lmao 
Is Tua the GOAT? Especially impressive considering the language barrier.
Main feed crapped out.  Switched to All-22.  No Herbie.    This is great.
Think they can understand Tua on the sidelines?
[This thread right now.](https://youtu.be/3KquFZYi6L0)
HE WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL ONE YEAR AGO
BecauseTheyAreAGoodTeam
Saban benched him. No reports of any injury 
He laid an egg...
*Hawaiian
ESPN has a shit stream. It''s not just you
He's simply a better passer. A crazy good passer.
Hurts will not take another snap at BamaTago is the future 
Saban makes the call Urban never would with that benching...and is rewarded....fuck
They'll just call him the Flyin' Hawaiian
It was one drive. Calm down. 
Because he led the team to under 100 yards of offense.
They've already dramatically changed the complexion of the game
To be fair, the punt should've been blocked, and if not that, UGA should've had a 1st down off the facemask.
Sorry, I meant TD drive before the half. The play where Godwin ran out of bounds on his own. No flags were thrown.
Which anime is this 
I think we found Saban's secrit player
Fucking tell me about it. I can't take it. The commercials are fucking flawless.
Don't usually agree with a UM fan but... So accurate. 
No way UGA prepped for getting boned by the refs multiple times a drive.
Benched
<3 I've been hoping for this since the middle of this season and i am so damn happy, if not for the win, for Tua throwing a tuddy in one of the biggest games of his life.
One true freshmen is going to end their first year throwing a game ending interception
IM INFURIATED RIGHT NOW
Life goals
Cause he was bad?
They needed someone with the ability to make throws downfield 
He sucked in the first half. 
Where you been?
Followed by the illegal block in the back on the ensuing punt.edit: Oh, and the fact that it was an OFFENSIVE penalty on the punt block, not a defensive offsides.
Ahhhhh
Refs gave Bama the ball back but lets not pretend like that touchdown wasn't just Tua shredding Georgia's D
I'm really not ready for the week long Nick Saban is a genius circlejerk that's going to be everywhere when they win this thing.
With some help from the refs
He''s ass my dude 
Sorry, I meant TD drive before the half. The play where Godwin ran out of bounds on his own. No flags were thrown.
As someone who was removed as qb in my friend''s thanksgiving football game I know exactly what hurts is going through 
Fuck ea. FUCK ALABAMA #AND FUCK THE REFS!
Bama are the Patriots of CFBGeorgia is a team from the state of GeorgiaWe all know how this ends
I'm glad that bama scored so quickly so that I can get back to these commercials
Guys, did Alabama just casually discover a future Heisman winning QB?
PASSING GAME IS BACK ON THE MENU BOYS!
TuaHurtsTooGood
I'm am
Jalen better get those transfer papers ready 
Tua is good. 
Fuck whoever went for the tackle with the shoulder, may end up costing IF the game
[deleted]
B1G baby. 
I miss that show
Have a little faith, we''re still winning. 
Nick Saban decided to let down all of America and put someone in the game that can actually play :/
Saban didnt play Tua all year so GA couldn't get film on him. All planned.
Only a coach with the stature of Saban could pull his QB out of the national championship game. 
God I fucking hate when Refs make the game about themselves like that last drive. Jfc.
you DONT have a pet AT-AT?
Looks like it
Aww
Thank the refs real quick 
He shit the bed
In what world would you bench the QB who took you to a second from winning the natty last year, throughout the year
So that''s what Bama looks like with a QB who can actually throw
lolbamawins
Wow. Hurts must really be terrible. 
Benched. 
Probably because OSU should''ve been in the playoffs. 
I'll make my secondary flair wisconsin in honor of you if it happens.
UGA has to run. This is like your motherfucking New Year's resolution. I know it doesn't feel good. I know it doesn't feel like you're making any progress. But Just. Fucking. Do. It.That's how they win. Just power through it.
Question  .   For all people saying the refs robbed Georgia for that offsides and should be up 20-0.  Do they realize it should be a fall start if anything and  the block wouldn't have happened anyways?... (unless things work differently in college football) 
It was all part of the plan. Saban knew Kirby would be able to adjust to shut down bamas offense at the half so the QB change was part of the plan so UGA couldn't adjust at half time.
Classic EA rubber banding. 
Because the refs handed them that. 
I don''t think Saban thought he had it in him to win
Offense was trash, decided to mix it up to see if they would have success 
Benched
Tua time.
If bama wins this then saban will be jerked off even more. i thought we had reached the ceiling lmao
where''s that one ref who looks like he doubles as a pro wrestler at when you need him 
I wasn't paying attention earlier. Why is hurts out? No that I'm complaining
I was gonna stop watching at half time, then I remembered that one game where the falcons were up like 85 points and lost to the patriots. Football is funny.
Did not see this coming. Bama fans just hyping about Tua for next season. Well.. Christmas came early for 2018. 
Refs are fine, letting them play football. 
Well if he got arrested for something he''d come over to Auburn
He trash
It's nice to see that we finally spent more than $19 on our commercial
I love this kid. I feel a bit bad for hurts, but it seems like it was the right decision. 
It''s-not-a-Tuamah?
Because Saban said so
All in they mouths 
and if they dont mess up calls, uga is at bamas 15 going in for at least 3. we can do this all night. 
Dat facemask tho
Oh shit the Bama fans are back
Jalen exposed? Dawgs D exposed? Roll tyyyde? 
God dammit Helfrich.
Wonder how much Georgia game planned for Tua coming in at Half time?
WHAt you don't have AT-AT's just sitting around?
Give me a break! 
He's ass, my dude
Because he wasn't completing plays
They need to get all the left handed footballs out of storage
Does this mean Jalen Hurts transfers to ASU now?
Miss facemask, missed offsides, missed holding.These refs are seriously fucking shit.
"Jalen hurts has transferred ...."
I gotta say, I didn''t expect this game to be as much fun as it is.  Cheers.
Well he threw for 23 yards in the first half
He sucked first half.
Benched. 
No foul for the obvious hold, ouchie
We''re all thinking it lol.
It was a 10-14 point swing since y'all also got screwed out of at least a FG.
ESPN is some poop 
Favorite 3rd QTR comment so far, I LOL''d
Transfer to UCF?
I was laughing with my girlfriend before the game saying “lol if Alabama''s down then the *last* thing they''d do is give the ball to a freshman QB who has never played before!”I guess that''s why Saban is the coach and not me. 
Well, Saban may not be as insane as we all thought after all. 
I would be livid if I was a UGA fan. Football is a game of momentum and the momentum of this game changed based on some bad refereeing. 
fuck you UGA, you're not the first public university
lets go bama, what a story if they win!
F
This is the only game of college football I've seen all year. Why wasn't Tugavailoa the starter all year? Hurts looked like a better running back than a quarterback.
In every game Bama plays no matter how much they're down by you have that sinking feeling they can and will come back and win. 
This is insane, what a game 
The Bammers I know have been begging for him all year bc Hurtz seems to have taken a step back minus Lane.  Lane is kind of a punk but dude is a quarterback whisperer 
Jacksonville State probably.
Agree 100% but this new QB looks good. Best of luck rest of the game
Tua overcomes the language barrier/UGA defense 
OH MY FUCKING GOD 7 POINTS. OH GOD OH GOD. 
he's not wrong
In fairness they aren't calling it on Georgia's line either so at least it's consistent.

God damn right
Jesus ESPN. Literally your biggest event of the year and you can't get your shit together. Spending my night trying to watch 11 white pixels play 11 red pixels is not fun. If you're going to advertise this service on everything maybe make sure it's functional firstFuck it, I'm just going to play Halo in angst now 
a regular Peyton Staubach out there
Hnngg yes pls
Played like shit in the first half. 
Lol no. Holdings aren't questionable when the Alabama player has a hand full of jersey. 
Did Tua really do anything that special? Looked more like just bad defense from Georgia.I'll need to see a bit more before declaring Tua the savior lol
wait I wasn't paying attention.  Did Jalen Hurtz get injured or did they just bench him??
you got the beefy
Dabo: Start Cooper. Got it.
Maybe. But the game is on the refs. I don't know how anyone can deny that.
I''m so glad I saw this 
Texas pls
What a joke. That "offsides" call totally changed the game. I'm embarrassed those are B1G refs 
Hurts just rubbed his bad juju on Tu''a smh
Yea in the game plan to bench the starter lol 
The refs? 
Shit, a Bama QB that can pass
Refs did a great job getting Bama back in the games. 
Better lefty?Tua TagovailoaorJared Lorenzen
No, that block was never going to stand. It should have been a false start, which would have ended the play before it started. Either way, that play was dead.That face mask was super, super blatant. Not sure how they missed that. 
Or UCF 
If your flair said "refs," then yes, you are doing it 
***Updated Mathematical Score Prediction***Georgia 21.5867158672 - 11.6236162362 Alabama
So I'm guessing Jalen Hurts doesn't have an NFL career as a QB if he can't make it through the national championship game without being replaced by a Freshman. That a fair statement? 
I really wish Georgia would've just broken my heart late in the regular season or SEC Championship like normal. This is gonna hurt, isn't it?
RIP Hurts
He'd be a killer tailback.
He was benched. Tua started the 3rd quarter 
Okay Jalen. So, you're going to play really shitty and then we're going to start Tua in the 2nd half. 
I'm feeling the opposite. UCF gets smashed by these guys.
WHAT DID YOU DO
Awesome! We don't get much west coast beer in NY! 
We have a fucking game boys.
I mean he went to the same school as Mariota so it should be possible
This shit happens in all major sports. Betting is a game of guessing who Vegas wants to win
Benched. 
Yes, but from 10 yards of field position is 10 yards.
What's the state fish of Hawaii?    Humuhumunukunukuapua`a. Yeah, bitch. 
To throw to what receivers? 
It''s maddening. It really is. 
were paying for 2nd place so i left them out
I blame the B1G
Try ItHurtsTuaBeThisGood
Hurts in frosts offense... 
The punt block would have been false start and a dead ball foul. It wouldn''t have counted anyway. The missed facemask however...
[removed]
Nutrisystem made my mom fatter
The lack of calls on bama cannot be understated
With these refs, UGA has already lost
Every truck commercial is like a big dick humblebrag contest. 
Take your damn B1G refs back to the B1G. They can eat a dick!!
they missed the false start on bama on the punt so I'd say they are being pretty fair. 
Seems like it's Jojos Bizarre Adventure rn
Eh, close enough.
Tua is scary now
I'll take that over bing the little brother who will never be good enough.
This is gonna be another "lol Bama wins" season, isn't it? 
Wahh wahhh cry about it
No questions asked someone will take him #1 in the 2018 draft
Lol yes. Hes a great runner, his reads blow, you take away the first read and he tucks and runs. If he's smart he will convert.
All right, all right. I might have been a little too quick to call for Nick Saban's firing.
Who would win? 1 SEC champ or one true freshy boi?
I know it''s just one drive but how has this kid been sitting behind Hurts all season
It's just funny as hell to me that I don't ever remembering Alabama running a spread offense with a DT QB until after they lost to Ohio State. Urban teachin Saban a lesson.
"High Class," lol.Is Kirby Smart a gym rat?
Not like this. Georgia don't do this
F R E S H M E N Q B SRESHMENQBS
Hurts can't spot shit.
Or lose the game. That''d be cool too
Stop. I can only get so erect 
How was Kendrick Lamar? 
As a newly spread Florida can take Hurts lol Mullen can make him serviceable 
Tago is our leader, now.
This just in: Hurts to transfer to FAU
Imagine if Saban knew Tua was the superior QB this whole time but chose not to play him until the championship game to catch the competition off-guard. 
Who would win? 11 bulldogs or one Hawaian boi
DAE remember Garrett Gilbert????
I've been saying for a long time that I wouldn't want Jalen Hurts as my QB for 3-4 years. He just isn't that great of a passer
Whoever is operating the replay on the coaches room is about to get throat chopped 
Honestly... I''ve been saying all year Jalen is sub-par. Tua can''t scramble but fuck he doesn''t need it 
BecauseTheyCanFacemaskTheirOpponentsButTheirOpponentsCantFacemaskThem.
Yeah, that last drive was totally on the refs.
Lad... 
Oh... haven't had problems with my Roku stream so far...other than the usual 5 second delay
Missed facemask, waived off holding call. The fix is in. 
QUARTERBACK CONTROVERSY
TUATUATUA
lmfao 
I 'member.'Member when offsides shouldn't have been called on a blocked punt?
Bench
Hurts has just been prone to tunnel vision on Ridley. We have like 3 5* receivers back there.
I'd order it
When you are Bama and winning most games with RBs and defense...Wait you should know something about that! I'm willing to bet Eason starts all year if he doesn't get injured.
He blamed the qb and the team as a whole
The offsides call on the punt block is worse
Benched to start the 2nd half.
Benched
Bench lol
Bench 
http://www.cfbstats.com/2015/leader/national/player/split01/category01/sort01.htmlAverage stats? 2200 yards and 28 TDs is now average? 
Heisman Trophy winner Quinton Flowers could have done it so much better. 
I prefer to think of it less as terrible refs or corrupt NCAA and more buffalo wild wings wanting this game to go to OT since Bama didn't have a chance before the penalties/no-calls
Well that drive was weird without commentary
Dude, this NBA promo is so sick.
Man. That's cold for someone to pull you there.
bench at half
Hello there 
Because the guy is impotent and TUA is about 100x better.
Because he was balls today
I picked the worst possible year to move to the Alabama/Georgia area. It's going to be insufferable no matter who wins 
Fuck the refs 
And this is the end of Jalen. He is not a quarterback. Thank you Saban for finally seeing that.
He''s been shit since at least the LSU game. It''s a long time coming TBH
As a RB maybe 
Member when Bama had no offense in the first half? 
So do you like or dislike him? Lol
If Tua''s gonna hit the guys downfield that Hurts was missing, Georgia''s in a lot of trouble
All fans should be infuriated 
E$PN
That was great, but give it until the end of the game. If Tua wins this, I'd be surprised if Jalen doesn't transfer. 
Bench 
Benched him
Well he's been there but he's never Hurts first read so he rarely gets the ball
Bama had 0 points at the half. The offense looked lost the entire first half. 
Pretty much
Let''s see this turn into a shoot out now. 
Fuckin Danalytics
So, if Alabama wins is everyone going to call it a win solely because of the refs?
No points scored in the first half 
Where will Hurts transfer now that his career is over? 
As someone who grew up in Hawaii, I''m finding it harder and harder to root against Bama right now... 
Gotta love the 2nd amendment 
Yeah...that''s all I''ve been thinking about since halftime ended. I hope they can adjust on the fly. We need a long drive to give the defense time. 
Anywhere with a spread, and he will do great.
"secret"
This Hurts the Hurts
Benched because they lost confidence in him. Far as anyone knows he isn't injured. 
Tagovailoa has really stepped up. Can''t believe he''s just a freshman 
Hahahaha
bench
benched. 
Nah, more like Grambling. 
That makes a lot more sense. I'm starting to wonder how Hurts won the starting spot though after seeing Tau ball out on that drive. 
Hurts to #theFAU 
Alright. Let's get a long drive so Kirby can adjust to the new QB and the refs.
I wonder what school Jalen will transfer to?
I feel bad for Hurts. He's a great kid, has a good mentality, works hard. But can't get it done against elite defenses. But sometimes changes have to be made 
Who knew Georgia was "the birthplace of American public higher education"
Benched 
Where were you when Jalen Hurts 
So where is hurts going to transfer to lol
Why has bama not run short passes really at all this year until Tua comes in. The plays before seemed to be so slow to develop and no slants or anything. Was it Jalen or play calling or both?
With a 5 star fucking backup (who is the highest rated QB to come to Clemson including Watson). 
Benched
Or these refs!
Who?
FIU, USF, etc those schools would definitely take him 
Lol at Fowler creaming his jeans over a qb completing a pass to an in route
What girl is about to kiss your nasty ass after eating that subway sandwich?
I just came back to the game. Did Hurts get benched?
Commentating a shit game has to be slightly worse than watching it. 
Called offsides on a clearly onsides punt block and missed a face mask.
The ref is a BIG10 ref. Calm down with the bias here
Fuck the olineman that tackled your dude
Bc dude is not good at fooball 
If we lose I'm jumping in the UCF club for those screwed by governing officials. 
wowza, whatadrive put together but that tua dude. that scramble on 3rd and those throws?
We like jalens
Benched.
Honestly, I don't think Hurts is all that mad about this. The offense under him just wasn't working. With Tua out there, the Georgia defense has no clue what to expect from him. There's no surprise that Alabama was prepping Tua for the Sugar Bowl too. 
Tfw when you get put on the spot
His ass got benched
Bench
Glad to see you have no idea what a pick play is. guessing you've never played a down in your life omegalul
Tua comes in and orchestrates a drive but everyone bitching about a missed call. Lmao
Apparently that last line as actually< come out dick swinging and slinging TDs
How many people you think are going to get a, "Princess Bride," quote?

Benched him at halftime
They pulled him for Tua.
Let the bidding begin for Jalen Hurts.

I hope not brother

Saban mad
Watch out for those second half comebacks, Georgia. They aren''t fun
Pepperidge Farms remembers. 
Yeah those calls were 7 kinds of fucked
benched
He Hurts their chances of winning
we haven't been watching the same game
Johnny Cash Version.
benched after the 1st half
He''s out for the same reason that you''re not complaining. 
I watched Tua come in during one of y'alls games earlier this year... he's legitimately the one guy I didn't wanna see tonight
ouch
Alabama switching qbs and getting the lead? I need more to drink...
[Watching Alabama cut their deceit to a one-possession game and feeling that old familiar dread build up inside you.](http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/016/979/e8c.jpg)
Tua “Mariota” Tagovailoa 
Time for Chub or Sony to break one open and swing the momentum back.
as much as i hate bama, it''s a one possession game
I didn't drink during the Ohio State NCG - not until we won and I could pop the bubbly
Pretty f'ing big of Hurts to be out there celebrating with Tua right away. Respect.
it's just a little extra ballsy throwing Tua in considering he's a lefty and Jalen is a righty. blocking scheme is all different etc.
Free safety taking over for Fitzpatrick 
One I'd stop watching after the second episode
benched
I think he's just sitting.
The refs didn't allow Georgia's secondary to get shredded or give up that huge first down run. The refs haved sucked but if Georgia loses, it's on them 
duel threat
Georgia happened
Poor performance.
"YOU ACTIVATED MY TUA CARD" ~Nick Saban
Georgia sports are cursed because of the 1996 Olympics
Patriots are their spirit animal 
They all copied THE Grambling State University
I just tuned in. What happened to Jalen, did he get injured? What led to the new quarterback and when did he come in?
I told ya you need Tua to win this
Savage
UWImagine Hurts and Taylor lololol
Bench
thank the refs for that drive
Mariota is about to bring home the Championship
Sorry we all just turned it back on
Did you just start watching?  LOL
Or Saban told him to...
I do not enjoy watching Tau play football. He is not my favorite QB.When he doesn't score a touchdown, I think to myself "yes".When he does scores a touchdown, I think to myself "this hurts".
Fuck the refs
Offense couldn''t get anything going.  
He was very good.
Water?
Benched
Where does Hurts transfer to?
Darth Vader is Luke''s father
$30 microtransaction 
Nah QB for another team.
God help us 
Alabama scored 0 in the first half
So not hurt? Just wasn''t producing?
I want to bitch about the refs, but also you have to make tackles. So... fuck the refs. 
I've lost all respect this is absolutely rigged. I wont be silent. Just saw it live sry.
Here come the salty downvotes from UGA fans. That's okay, jokes on you, I want the downvotes ok
please
I could spit fire
They blew a couple calls. Shit happens. 
Hmm, looked pretty clear to me, but I never saw the replay because my stream cut out. Did he just get an amazing jump? Watching it live it looked to me like he was past the line before the snap. 
The Hurts Locker
Not enough Hot route, Dougie. 
Looks like a Utah DL name
Benched him 
He sucks Tua is the captain now
He needs to see a doctor immediately.  That is a very serious condition.
Hurts should transfer to FAU with Lanewould be lit
I'll give you the facemask but honestly if you're going to complain about the offsides call on the punt then you need to complain about the false start. The false start would've prevented the block. You can't have it both ways.
Yeah I'm furious 
Benched at half, came out with Tua on first drive. 
Benching Hurts was like Alabama just took off their *Dragon Ball Z* weighted clothing.
Benched. He was playing pretty poorly
18 I'm pretty sure. True Freshman
We should have had Tua tackled on that 3rd down scramble. Can't blame the refs for that one.
Yeah that was crap
I want you to be wrong. But you are so right
Smh, saban has his own Mariota now
RIP Hurts' draft prospects
That's cold man. Where does he go?
I mean, the o line was straight up wrapping up and tackling guys. 
He wasn''t playing well
Pfft I thought they should've done that halfway into the Iron Bowl, Hurts has been an awful passer for most of his career and it was pretty obvious to me that he's their biggest liability...
That was a good drive by Tua. Looks like we got a QB controversy.
"Tua is good and should be playing"Big if true. 
The Alabama Patriots are on the move.
Lol
He dun
Preach 
Bama went Big XII mode.
More local church commercials. Really gets me in to the game...
Uh he''s played a lot 
Sorry buddy.
He missed a wide open TD in the 1st quarter and has generally played poorly this game. When it's all on the line, you either hit reset with Tua or hope Hurts figures it out. Hurts had some accuracy issues and was holding onto the ball too long as well. His only good play with a 30 yard scramble.
Cause he sucks
How many times will they say "TRUE FRESHMAN"?
Just a big ole pit in my stomach. I don''t like the feeling of this as a Dawgs fan 
Alabama was never going to lose this. They''ve paid everyone from the refs to the NCAA. Fuck Bama 
I still watch that game sometimes. Of course no one knew it was the beginning of all this.
When you're switching out a linebacker for a qb it isn't that crazy.
Dawgs gotta go next level and put in high school senior Justin Fields now.
Benched
He got shut out the first half
Should the Browns take Tua at #1?
To summarize:- Refs miss two false starts on punt against in favor of Alabama.- Refs called offside for a player that wasn't in favor of Alabama.- Refs miss defensive face mask against GA in favor of Alabama.- Refs PICK UP flag for blatant, obvi holding in favor of Alabama.In like 3 minutes.
He couldn't generate any offense
3 FUCKING TIMES
I''m afraid you''re new here. We all know the hype. 
holy crap!!!!!! 
Because loyalty or something. Tua is gonna be the best Bama QB ever
Went 3-8 for 21, did not look confident in the pocket, made poor decisions an experienced NCG quarterback shouldn''t make, like staring down one receiver while staying in the pocket for four seconds
Thank baylor lmao
Jalen Hurts exposed
this sub is about to melt down
How the fuck do you go from being seconds away from a title as a true freshman to being benched and now being rumored to transfer?? How can things turn that quickly?? 
Really impressive drive by Tua there.
Seriously. Refs are the main reason for their momentum
HE'S GOT A CASE OF THE HULKAMANIA
Who cares if you fuck up you still want to win the damn game. 
Benched
Not watching much of Green Bay or UGA
So where will Hurts be transferring next year?
I don't know how I feel about the aerial shot of UGA in their commercial showing the entire campus covered in thick ass humidity 
Thank god anthropomorphic piggy banks don't actually exist
Oh dear lord 
Jerk away bro, he's totes 18+
A report came out and said he was going to play in the playoffs Never said when though 
QUARTERBACKS AREN'T JUST FAST, THEY'RE STRONG! Thanks Captain Kirk
You're not from Harvard
Benched
Also these refs are kind of diarrhea.
I hope that's the Johnny Cash cover and not whiny Trent Reznor.
We benched him. Nick decided the offense needed a shot in the arm, and after watching Jalen flail around and do nothing, he made the move. 
Nope
There is no controversy. Tua is the QB, Hurts is the backup, or he transfers. 
I forgot about it. It''s the most flimsy-assed coozie ever
That drive was just slants. Jalen Hurts can''t throw a slant? 
I'm not sure how they can score decimal points but football rules are so complicated these days
I don't think many people were realistically pegging him as an NFL QB anyway.
Roll refs
That southern accent ad...
Looks like UGA won't be the only Georgia team to blow a half-time lead in the championship game within a calendar year
BANCH 
Your not wrong, but I hate you.
I'll take one Jalen Hurts please
Take your upvote and tell Dabo I said hi.
Thank you. Went back and can confirm. 
Trademark it.
ok
Someone finally dad dicks Alabama at their own game and they respond by unearthing a QB of the future. Great.
Hope so
Satan himself
Spoiler 
He's out because Saban has finally decided to open his eyes and play the guy who is a fantastic passer.
This isn''t Oklahoma 
I like football.When football is on the TV I think: "yes"  When commercials are on the TV I think: "no"
https://m.imgur.com/gallery/NQjgc89
This was always going to be a 7 point game. Having the refs take 7 from us and then not give us a chance to get 7 again is a huge reason to be salty.
Hard enough to beat Bama in the first place. Virtually impossible when the refs are blowing these calls.
plz no
You wanna go ahead and name pall bearers or should we just figure that out after the fact?
Somewhere in Mississippi
Alabama's best player has been sitting on the sideline all year
Thanks refs
< clean the shit out and drive down the field 
Tua freshman
If anyone is familiar with it I would think it would be the state of Georgia 
No, they don't realize it
No I meant as in trying to muscle Tua out from under center and shit. 
Maybe you don''t... they''re losing...
GT
Pruitt, bring him with you plz
Possibly the worst lip syncing in the history of lip syncing
na two qb system all day
Just got on break and been "watching" through alerts. Is Hurts out?
My thoughts exactly. This kid's got vision and pocket presence. 
Benched him for Tuscaloosa-Mariota. 
Honestly maybe I expected too much, but he was "only" ok
That would have prevented you from having the ball.
This game just got a lot more interesting. I heard Tua was Mariota 2.0. That drive was impressive. 
Why does it always have to happen to Georgia?
5/6 for 46 and a TD = 202 QB rating
I've never wanted something more
Piccolo is Bama confirmed
We got it. its all good. No points in the first half.
They straight up benched him in the national championships. The balls on saban
benched him

You guys can be bros with cool academic logos. Y'all got some cool ones. 
And the CFP, yeah
lmao okay
that drive isn't happening if georgia O still on the field lol. also, multiple missed calls. 
Flair up bro
Hurts may be able to squat 500 pounds, but can he throw a touchdown pass this game?
The offsides/false start call was pretty close IMO, but that face mask miss was inexcusable. Would've been UGA 1st and 10 around the 50 rather than 3rd and 20+ from the 30
FAU
It''d be funny if Saban had him convert to a rb. 
Benched
Ehhh
FAU 
No one is better than Hefty Lefty
Those missed calls were pivotal in your team getting the ball back 
Born and raised GA, rest of the family went to Bama. I don't even know. Never expected it to be like this. 
I like him on a team other than BamaAssuming you mean do I like Hurts
Tbh I thought it was an offside when I was watching it live too. That missed facemask is inexcusable.
One Hurts pls
Whichever band is playing Starships will win
Stay strong. Both of you guys 
The dankest timeline 
f
Aight. Could've been better but not terrible. okay perfromed 3 songs all off of Damn 
I mean....the blocked punt was a false start. The play wouldn't have happened anyway.
Jalen hurts is just that bad.
What do we know about this Tua?? How sure are we that isn't Jimmy G with a darker tan?
I'm convinced the refs call games to make them more competitive.
QB battle over
Refs don't win games for teams but they definitely fuck them for some.
Jesus people are acting like there have never been missed calls before.  Georgia is still up.  The refs haven't "gifted" this game to anyone--Georgia still 100% controls their own destiny.
Sign up for a free 7 week trial of youtube tv real quick if you want. Excellent stream quality.
He's athletic enough and big enough to be a WR or an RB. Just not a QB.
Honestly better than I expected. I tuned in late but I don't think he played DNA. I was really hoping for DNA. 
They didn''t pay me :(
He played like shit.
We have been saying this all year. We have so many weapons on offense it is pretty amazing that Hurts has lasted this long into the season.
ohh there goes UGA again, claiming to be the oldest public university, come on guys
I like Tua.I enjoy watching Tua play football. Tua is my favorite current Alabama QB.When Tua throws a touchdown, I think to myself "Yes."When Tua doesn't, I think to myself "No."
Crazy how much of a difference sitting in the pocket makes. 
Yeah that''s why it''s risky...
Letting them facemask and block in the back?
Still, he was surrounded at one point
This is hilarious I love this comment. 
Auburn
The salt is about to be utterly insane.
I mean they''re still losing rn 
It was founded in 1785 the first state funded college in America
Decline the penalty
well, when it wrongly halts georgia's drive...yeah.
nah. He jumped as the ball was being snapped. pause it when he jumps he is clearly onsides. 
My dad is so pissed about Tua. "Saban shouldn't have put in a freshman! He's so stupid"... Yeah the millions of dollars and multiple championship victories but you do you dad
Man I'd watch that.
I guess not growing up with a crimson bib doesn't have me as blindly faithful to Bama, but this sub is already insufferable about anything that isn't black and white Bama proving to be a better team. Don't want to win on bullshit just as much as it fucking sucks lose due to it
It's going to be really funny when UGA fans insist that UCF is the real title winner after Saban wins this thing
I mean it *is* alabama afterall
Same and it sucks haha
He will lose those crosses at some point...
Jalen sucked big time. So we made a change. 
Top qb recruit i think lol
TUA!!! He never had a snap. I mean Fromm's been playing all year. This kid Tua he wasn't supposed to play, didn't practice with the starters, here he is.
"You didn't hear? Dedicated. Whole big thing. We had a funeral for a bird."
yup
**Developing Story**: Sources tell me Jalen Hurts heavily weighing decision to transfer to the faU. 
Maybe Hurts and Eason can hang out. 
UGA - 13 UA - 0 Refs - 7
Even if Bama balls out with Tua out there and wins now there's still gonna so much salt to these refs. You don't know if it'd have changed the game, but you know it helped result in that TD
I agree. It's not over yet though 
God i hope Alabama wins
2nd half comebacks and the state of Georgia go hand in hand
I'll give Bama $20
He did nothing. We couldn't tackle
Saban brought Tom Herman in after that game to teach him some concepts. Not even joking. 
Of course
I just realized this matchup is the college NE Patriots vs. the college Atlanta Falcons...
It's one thing to let the players play, it's another to miss a fucking facemask and an obvious not offside on the punt block.
Tag-a-voo-lie-voh-uh
One thing is for sure, Urban would never do this.
All weekend we had bad officiating in football. People actually thought that it wasn't going to happen in CFB? lol
The best man should play. 
I'm assuming he didn't show himself to be the starter in practice. Although, then again, Saban has historically been very hesitant to start true Freshmen. I think Hurts was the first ever under Saban
it was 2 easy to miss calls, you're defense still could've gotten the stop on the td drive stop whining
That drive was freaking terrifying
Saban is slow
Burger King
Why?  If it wasnt offsides then it should have been a false start.  Either way the blocked punt would never happen.
But they did get away with two penalties on that drive, right?
Hurts to FAU for the memes. 
Jalen hurts is gonna play again. They''re going to run 2 QBs 
Guys Bama might have found a legit QB and I've never been more scared for the future of CFB
We're going for 15k comments on this one.
That drive shouldn''t have happened. Two BLATANT penalties not called.
Jalen be Hurtin now, amirite?
He was horrible in the first half. Saban benched him.
Obviously. Bama has no talent, only the refs. /s
(Calls)Tua is awesome though
Tua can't scramble? Did you see his scramble on third down that drive?
I fucked up guys. I fucked up real bad. 
*Georgia curse intensifies* 
Saban is a genius for pulling Hurts.  This kid is amazing.
Now we're all in big, *big* trouble.
Football players love it when you do that.  You just walk up and grab 'em by the facemask
I'm just saying if the refs made those calls things would be a little different
Auburn.
Welcome brother.
Benched him
They will be anyways. Those two obviously incorrect calls swing the entire game 
Eli Newton
I WAS 1 SO I WOULDNT KNOW IF YOU WON IT OR NOT HAVE YOU BEEN TO THE PRESTIGIOUS COLLEGE FOOTBALL PLAYOFF THO?
Chances are they will have the #1 pick in a few years if Hue is still the coach so yes.
Hawaii. Wanted to follow Mariotas footsteps at Oregon but they didn''t offer him 
I had to sign up for a free trial of a cable streaming provider it was so bad
Saban knew this would happen 
B1G refs- “CFB says the game is boring, let''s change it up.”
Bench
Damn right
OU.. wait
How do you explain that third and 7 recovery from a near sack
UGA fans... It's one fucking TD, stop beating yourselves up over it.
Definitely won''t 
Tag-O-Vale-oh-a (i can joke because im from Oklahoma. We are rednecks too)
At least 21, so far. And I''m already four rounds in at a hotel bar, which is when I start going obscure with the references. 
[removed]
The blocked punt really hurt before that as well honestly.
Yeah, as a neutral player that was absolutely disgusting. 
Starting WR next year
Kind of hard when 3 key plays were due to the refs.
He started with DNA
The dude is an idiot. Henry was the best rusher in football in 2015.
Nah
More like one huge break with the facemask and one absolutely inconsequential missed false start...
Yep
fudge
If you like hip hop he killed it. If you are half the people in this thread you hated it.  Also he straight up didn't lip sync. People are fucking morons. 
That's a toss-up if you ask me
Just this drive. Hurts is fine but he wasn't making enough progress I guess. Saban wants a passing QB in.
Lots of praise for Tua before this game. Hurts is a good DT QB, but Tua definitely is going to be the thorn in SEC teams' side for a while. That drive is small glimpse as to what this kid can do.
Anyone else having issues with the PS4 ESPN app? Im hardwired and it keeps skipping.Edit:I switched to one of the alternate streams (command center and homers) and they're much better.
He hasn't had any.
Not hurt. He just couldn''t move the ball in the air 
That was also a poor decision. 
smh they still sucking Bama's dick
Don''t forget when they made up a first down
I love Tua and I thought he would play a series or two in this game no matter the score but he wouldn't shine until next year but man he is throwing a wrench into Georgia's game plan. You need points in the air he is your man.
He threw three slants. If Georgia can't adjust to that their DC is incompetent. They also had him dead to rights on 3rd down and decided to tackle like pop warner players. I wouldn't overreact yet. 
I don''t know man, Bama has ridiculous run defense. 
That really is wild as hell
Dumb
DON'T BRING IT OUT
And now the momentum is flipped....
It's going to hurt bad. 
Content Cop: Jalen Hurts
49
Everyone shits on cable/satellite until their streams don't work lol
The Spanish stream is usually pretty reliable too
Daboll probably pressured him hard to do it. Remember, Saban kept Hurts in last year and all this year. 
He scrambled pretty well on that one play
Yea blatant face masks, holds, false starts, picked up flags are def all part of the game. Gtfo outa here with that 
I dont think this thread can handle a Alabama comeback 
So where does Hurts transfer to?
Bama is like "AND THIS IS TO GO EVEN FURTHER BEYOND"
Just wait it gets better. GO DAWGS!!!
I stayed just to see if bama switched to a freshman at half. Crazy. 
yikes
That was a given.
why you return that?
this is usually the point in a game where there is a huge mistake...
HARDMAN NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Why
Oh yes. 
Hurts to FAU confirmed 
welp UGA yall had a good run, smh
Take the knee dude. God damn.
That was ill advised
Why would you not take a knee?
Dumbass why would you bring that out. Fucking idiot
bama looks like bama again
Like pull up, ball out, score nowMade it look sexy
Yeah it sucks
Henry ran for over 2,000 yards wut 
Big10 refs surely are the worst in the country 
I'm so sorry you guys have to deal with these B1G refs. But now you know what everybody in the B1G has to experience each week. 
That was a stupid ass decision. 
Yes
The ESPN feed has never worked for me and I have 100mb down. I usually go with the alternate feeds if they have them. Sounds of the Game is my favorite. All 22 isn''t bad either. 
Bad
True Frommsh vs Tua Frosh.
Im so glad Tua is getting the job done, but I wish it was Hurts.
FAU
Hopefully wishbone halfback in Saban's party-like-it's-1979 offense next year.
As if he had any in the first place
Yo burn that shit 
*Corn and maize-color intensifies*
Barely on both. That's football. 
When you realize both QB's in the national championship are true freshmen just like you (not like it's been mentioned all night but)...I feel like such a failure :(
I''m so proud of Alabama for following Purdue''s *completely original idea* to use both quarterbacks in a game
Jalen Hurts submitting transfer papers as we speak 
why in the fuck do you run that out
Why would you not take a knee? Jesus
Momentum is back
Off to Knoxville, duh.
not his first snaps but basically his first meaningful snaps i believe
Yea he could, I think he ends up at UCLA.
UGA is getting stupid 
So dumb, don't give Bama more momentum
Guys I think Bama may be back in this
Wtf was he thinking 
[deleted]
The booth needs to be hosed down already after that drive. 
SPOILER TAG
Lol at calling UNC a university after those fake classes
Where were you when Kendrick Lamar killed Jalen Hurts?
Bama fans must be glad to see Tua's finally gotten over that language barrier
2nd Amendment?
Grinds my gears
No, we don't do those here
RIP Jalen Hurts 2016-Jan. 8, 2018
Seriously Georgia, get your head outta your ass.
Until the SECOND HALF.  "we'll spot them a few then put in Tua.  Mad they'll call me, but I'll show them all"
Why would you take that out?
I don''t think he ever had a chance at playing QB at the next level. Just doesn''t throw the ball well enough
Great decision to get some fire going.  This kid can ball.
Not true. He''s thrown like 50 times this year. Granted it''s always when Bama''s been up by like 20 points. 
True. But a lot of things could happen on the re-punt. Can't assume Georgia would come out of it better, where if it was a blocked punt they would obviously be in a better spot. The blatant facemask miss affected the game much more.
Could Hurts never start another game again?
That scramble....damn...
Dawgs can't fall apart now.
Lots of space in our cozy little stadium! 
They know their market
i fucking hate referees.
Special teams miscues.  I hate them *so much.*
I can already see next year's BWW commercials.  "We need OT" - cue refs calling off sides on a false start and ignoring a facemask, then picking up a holding call flag.  Fuck me, I'm good at this shit, hire me BWW!
There's a really bad decision.
That was bold taking it out
Imagine the chaos if Hurts went to FAU
Hurts to FAU for the memes
WE ARE THE ADDICTION NETWORK!
Praise lord Saban
What time is it? NBA prime time
So literally any other conference
Benched
Benched
This is quite the humid state
Should have kneeled that one.
Holy shit!
Jesus. Here comes the Georgia choke job. Brining it out there? Are you serious lmao
Trua freshman
We just now figuring out Hurts has been a damper on this Offense?
I swear this shit is scripted
You mean with the forward pass? Lol
Plus he has a cool ass name
What a stupid ass return attempt. 
You know what we all remember.
No one wants to be replaced and taken out in the biggest game of their lives. No one can be happy about it. Players live to play.
And Georgias going to begin self destructing.
This thread is the saltiest shit since Lot's wife.  
Bama fixing to beat that ass like a drum. 
And so it begins
[removed]
Blocked punt would've been overturned no matter what. False start is a dead ball penalty 
Make lefties great again
Soooo, that kid isn''t GOOD. But the refs are fucking awful(ly in the tank for Bama). 
I'm quite sure a not insubstantial portion of his paycheck goes toward ensuring his team puts points on the board every game.
The bomb Saban puts in his players'' heads will go off if he does.
why didn''t they just sack tua on 3rd & 7??? @kirby
lol UGA melting down.   stupid tackling.   stupid run out of the endzone.  step it up coaches do your job
Why the fuck would you bring that out bro? 3 and out here Bamas got it. Fuck
georgia is fucked
Benched at the half
Only Saban would bench his 25-2 starter at half lol...and have it work out...
Tua "I fucked your girl but it's cool" Tagovailoa
Welp, looks like another Georgia team is going to blow a lead in a championship game
Told ya, saban was making sacrifices to the devil in the lockerroom. 
Fuck it. Saban should put in Najee Harris and only play freshmen at WR too. 
i had one cold 2 hearted and my roommates ass hole German Shepard knocked it over right after i opened it
PAC12 ref throws flag
Bama had a false start on a punt called against UGA then they got away with a facemask.
Red and Black collapse II.The College edition.
Just take the ball at the 25, stupid play
Damn the momentum shift has been insane. 
Not as a QB, definitely 
Yes. I''m like 5 feet from the router and it says get closer. 
Wow. I missed that. Can't believe Herman actually would do that. 
That was fucking stupid 
Momentum is critical in football and the refs have blatantly handed it to bama. Hopefully georgia can respond.
People keep saying that putting in Tua was bad idea lol you just got a TD from that decision :P. I told ya I was right
Doesn't it just mean triggerfish or something
almost wonder why he waited this long
no lol
Big12 and Pac say, "Hold my beer"
balanced in your favor
Bold prediction, we are gonna See more Jalen Hurts 
take the touchback FUCK
We'll take him
I would like to submit one glasses-wearing kicker 
It certainly sullies the game
Better than JB
I know I was just joking cause the dude is not a quarterback 
Alabama has complete momentum
If you call ref ball a win sure 
Can he catch his own pass AND play OL?
I mean everyone has been saying that all year
One step at a time. LOL
Momentum in college football is huge.Just shifted to Bama. 
Ugh should''ve taken a knee
had to restart my stream
Mecole hardman more like fuck me hard man
GEORGIA PLS
Another state of Georgia meltdown. 
Congrats on your title Bama.
HA HA HAThey just keep this dude in their back pocket like "heh...ok lets play then"
His biggest fault.
Running the ball out of the end zone against Bama seems to be a really bad idea 
Hurts to FAU don't @ me #LaneTrain
Why Mecole? Just why
Playoff Tua might be 
Georgia has got some dawgs on the cheer squad lol. 
Pretty much. The last one was complete BS. Missing a call is one thing but picking up a flag is another
Basically it was no secret Tua wanted to come to Oregon and be the next Mariota. He played for the same highschool as Mariota. Helf and company had another QB they, consistent with their terrible track record of evaluating talent, liked better and they never really recruited Tua. That guy they liked more ended up decommitting anyway and is 3rd string at ASU now. 
When did Russell Wilson suit up for bama
That ... may happen
Since Jonah got hurt it actually is a bonus, that would be Jalen''s blind side.
Those churches must have one nice budget to be running ads on TV. Don't count on me next time the bowl gets passed around
Awesome. I''ve seen this story in literally every Georgia sport before.
In before a Georgia fumble
Can you take away momentum any more than that???
Don't be stupid Hardm- dammit Hardman...
these college kids are always so dumb bringing it out...
so how much sacrificial blood is in the alabama locker room?
Uhhh, Tua has played in 7 games this year....
wait I just got home from work. Hurts got benched? 
#Momentum 
So is Georgia, I fear :-(
But..... Momentum...
I get that they missed calls.  But Georgia could have ended that when they had 3 guys that couldn't tackle a qb 4 yards behind the line on 3rd down. 
WHY THE FUCK DO YOU BRING THAT BALL OUT?!! We''re choking. Oh my God. This is 28-3 all over again.
Hahaha Georgia about to choke like Michigan 
Subscribe
Trick question--two big XII refs!
You're high if you think that will happen.
while our season wasn't particularly a failure, it really does sting to think that with better QB play we could have possible won at least one or two more championships under meyer at this point 
Lord Voldesaben reminded the B1G refs of their deal. Pray he doesn''t alter it further.
That was a great tackle by the offensive line man on that Tua Scramble
Hurts wasnt even that good
Why the fuck does anyone ever run it out of the endzone
Georgia gonna Georgia, no matter the coach
Especially when all the other college kids are screwing their cousins. Plenty of women to choose from.
You don't know what black magic you're messing with!
As the son of a high school football official and studying to become one, can confirm
Has Saban made another 14 point man management decision?  Lets find out.
This is why he wins championships
He did well
Jalen doing badly. Benched Hurts coming out of half
Why the fuck do players always take those out?
I understand all fans complain about the refs, but Georgia/Falcon fans take it to a new level. 
1 is a bit high.  I''d take him at Tua.  
Eddie Guns called one if the NFL games over the weekend. He either doesn't lift at all, or doesn't lift heavy anymore.
Saban: tEmpO iS bAd For PlaYEr SAfeTy 
sickening
I was wondering why Alabama couldn't find a better QB than hurts
Game over tbh
Tua: hold my coconut juice
or INT
I'm so used to my emotions being articulated during drives like that. It felt creepy.
You're welcome Spock 
Bama's winning. It's over
He's hitting the open guys with extreme accuracy. Can't ask for much more. 
How do you “barely” facemask? 
Running QBs have been a thing for over a decade now.
All ESPN streams are struggling tonight :/
They need to do a Lambeaul.SEC vs. PAC 12. Winner gets two extra hand warmers per player
I drink Yuengling like water, I mean I couldn't start at work, at least on my beer. Coworker and I sipped some bourbon in the final couple hours. I think I'm actually too drunk right now. 
No country for old men on crackle? Alright I'll bite
Tua has been better all season tbh. Bama fans have been begging for this. Hurts has shown to be suspect for way too long.
Jalen Hurts watching his career at Bama end 
Georgia dline gotta get their hands up
Is Jalen Hurts just bad and Tua just executes significantly better, or did Bama change the style of offense for Tua and its just more effective?
Absolute SNAG by Godwin. 
great throw
UGA still wins
Alabama feeling the Hawaiian flavor now 
As an Ohio state fan I am very torn on this game. On one hand, I want to be able to say we didn''t get into the top 4 because the national champions took our spot. And on the other hand, I want the team who took our spot to get wrecked. What do I do.. how am I supposed to feel..
As a Falcon's fan, im not sure if I am insulted by this comment or not
Godddammmmmmmmit you''re right. 
Can't throw. 
What we do here is go *back back back back . . .*
He looked just fine scrambling on that drive.
Godwin's hands are Godlike
Holy shit nice catch
georgia moving again
SABAN IS A MUTHAFUCKING POOL SHARK. HE AN KIRBY MADE A BET AT HALFTIME
Nah, the Patriots should trade up and take him to start day 1/s
Wait until you're older than them :, (
He threw the ball where he wanted
Refs got invited to a Bama frat party at halftime
I''m surprised Georgia isn''t picking up on his hand signals
I gotta say, I thought it should've happened ages ago (cause I've always thought Hurts is an awful QB propped up by Bama talent), but I respect that Saban has the balls to finally do it halfway through the big dance.
Taking bets, what penalties will Alabama get away with on this series? 
That's not how you start regaining momentum, kick returner.
I am so fucking sick of this rapping commercial
That is very Bold, let's see how it hold up.
Can Dawgs tell a difference from red and black?
TIME FOR A SHOOT OUT!!
can we get hurts to come to rutger pls
Alright Fromm way to calm everybody down
http://i.imgur.com/PgybesT.png 
so that jalen hurts transfer courting is gonna be fun
Say freshman again and see what happens 
A&M?
For the true freshman 
I approve of this Kappa
TRUE FRESHMAN DRINK
Nice hands on the wide receiver damn
Buffalo Wild Wings said to make this a game so refs gotta miss 3 penalties on Alabama in second half 
that's some funny shit right there
At least jalen still looks engaged. Seems like a good kid. 
Uh oh bama come back
How good is this?  Not that good. Have you seen Hornibrook?
These quarterbacks are on fire. 
Alabama capitalized. Give them a tiny bit of credit, as much as I hate Bama. Georgia really let themselves down on defense on that drive.
Well coach was right at the half about needing "better decisions on special teams" but idk if the message got passed on
If we get a true freshman shootout in the 2nd half, that would be beautiful
Thanks Harvard 
Agree, but it happened because Bama reputation bias bs
Hey guys did you know they're true freshmen
Yeah he was playing like shit
HONESTLY, I'D RATHER WIN A ROSE BOWL THAN GET SHAT ON BY ALABAMA IN THE PLAYOFFS
Wait Fromm is a true freshman /s
This is over
We fucking get it, they're true freshmen
dawgs please
It was 13-0 lol
Missed face mask and missed blatant hold too. It''s a culmination. 
i hear these guys are true freshmen?
What were you thinking taking that one out?
GoDawgs ya done fucked up. Ya fucked up now. I'm actually being triggered by this momentum shift 
It just means more though
Big Mo
Now I feel dirty.
Put it on shirts 
Did you guys know that Fromm was a true freshman?
Was that Tua's first TD pass?
Oh yeah true. Well it''s a difference of 10 yds if I''m not mistaken, which you can send someone to attempt a block as opposed to being safe, not to mention slight variance of field position.
Maybe just get on bended knee and propose for some touch back. That was some rough six
why u bring that out...
True freshman.
Just wait until NFL players start being younger than you
Hot take #2: I think taking hurts out was a smart decision. 
NOT SO FAST
And you''re prolly cheering against the same fans 
Did you watch the first half?  He played like garbage, wouldnt throw the ball, stood flat footed in the pocket, got sacked repeatedly.  Alabama needed a passer, and they had one on the bench.
Was never put in after halftime. Tua came in instead.
Sadly we know first hand about this
[How does it feel to get benched in the Championship game?](http://www.thezone1059.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/hurts.jpg)
Are there any freshman playing today ?
Predicting a Georgia interception/fumble in at least the next 8 plays
I believe it's a big 10 crew 
[I will eat a loaf of my cats turd if bama comes back](https://m.imgur.com/a/6McpP)Its soft and malleable now im hoping it will be a little crunchier when the games finished :/ kinda like biting into a cookie that was cooked on 475° instead of 375° and the outside is crunchy and burnt but the inside is raw and gooey
He would be terrifying in the option bullshit
Lol the announcers are going nuts every time a pass is completed as if a freshman can't possibly do such a thing
Ha.  Pac12 are so much worse. 
Saban benched him for the better of the team. Roll Tide.
It''s my understanding that Hurts is pretty good 
https://imgur.com/Qg840jl
Did you see that thing happen?
Jalen Hurts was not blessed with good looks
Atlanta sports fans, I am sorry for the PTSD you must be experiencing right now.
Anyone watching this game in Texas feel like explaining the logic behind a "creamy au jus sauce." Isn't that just beef juice sauce on a sandwich with two beef patties?
Good point. Not from the Saban tree, but he *is* from the Alabama tree. That would be the biggest coaching change story since Roy Williams leaving Kansas for UNC.
Kirk Herbstreit tonight: Open chrome: Www.pornhub.com “True freshman” Creams pants 
WHOLE 'NOTHEER GAME NOW
Fromm is the truth.Win or lose, this freshman is going to be awesome for Georgia these next few years.
FUCK.
don't  jinx is pls
ERMAHGERD TERUE FERSHMERN
mele kalikimaka
Tua knows de wey
So if Tua was this good all alongWhy is he just now starting
Benched. 3-8, 21 yards
Yeah, they're still manhandling the shit out of us so I wouldn't be too worried if I were them.
TRUE FRESHMAN
Tua better start channeling his inner Mariota even further and start playing some other positions as well
Counterargument: Gymnastics.
Several things 
Chubb is flacid.
It feels like every impact player tonight is a true freshman. Could Georgia/Alabama be the next Cavs/Warriors?
Apology for poor english Where were you when Saban kill Hurts? I doing my homework and text rings Say Hurts is killNo
UGA RBs like to run the wrong way
The room full of UGA fans didn't like this one when i said it out loud. 
You''re right about those falcons fans.
Yeah, same. That was infuriating. 
2019 Houston QB Jalen Hurts
NEW LIFE
Yes Saben discovered that yards through the air count also
This ESPN stream is literally unwatchable. This is the worst it's ever been 
That was really odd without commentary. 
Man Chubb can''t get anything going tonight :/
Once upon a time, I thought ACC refs were garbage.And then we joined the BIG
turns out this Tua guy for Bama was Saban's hidden ace. Like in DBZ when Goku is hiding his new super saiyan power and then pulls it out at the very end only when he absolutely needs it so they other guys could get stronger and learn how to save the world on their own. 
Heh... you made me use 40% of my strength...
Running QBs that can throw have been. Hurts can''t throw 
I'm going to die
It's not whether he can or can't. He just doesn't.
JAKE FROMM STATE FARM
Missed that drive, what did the refs do?
please keep running
Who would win an actual conference and divisional champion or a crew of stripey bois
It's less officials and more football in general. 
Georgia really likes running backwards.
Every NFL scout is drooling so bad right now 
People saying it was over have never seen a team from Georgia play
Hurts had like 27 yards passing in the first half so they benched him
Hopefully
STOP TRYING TO RUN THE EDGE
Seahawks do have some time off...
I''d be lying if I said that after that touchdown I didn''t shout out a good ole “CHEEEEE HUUUUUU” 
So many true freshman.
Every ESPN stream of the main feed is garbage. Pick one of the alt streams (ie hometown radio call)
Zero chance
 Ya I have to believe the offense they played last week is still a fair bit better than this one. They can still get control back, and they're one missed series of tackles on one play from a stop. It's ok. 
wow amazing tackle by bama #28. got juked to the shadow realm, but managed to get him
only nick saban would game plan to use another QB in the second half. what the fuck is about to happen boys....
that was a fantastic catch on a poor throw and they're praising the shit out of fromm...
Tua's release is identical to Tim Tebow. Gonna be a great college QB. Release is too drawn out for the NFL tho. Ball hawks will eat that up. And yes I realize he's a freshman and has time to improve I hope he does 
10k of them shiting on the refs.5k about Bamas secret weapon QB
I thought it was dumb to bench Hurts, turns out Nick Saban knows more about football than I do.
Georgie pls...
Odds that Kiffin tweets at Hurts to transfeR?
Chubb needs to break that tackle
Oh god I just realized a lot of you guys are falcons fans. No idea why I didn't make that connection before. 
Damn. 
Are the refs just not calling anything against Bama?
STOP RUNNING BACKWARDS YOU DUMMY
What is with the Georgia running backs and going backwards 
I feel like the missed call on the blocked punt isn''t as big as you''d think. A false start on offense should result in the play being blown dead. Either way, Alabama would have to punt again. 
Damn I feel bad for HurtsFeels like Saban did him dirty, he's been the guy all year long, just let him finish out the game. If you were going to replace him why not do it sooner
holding, for sure. Probably also a block in the back if I had to guess. 
Ever been in a USC game thread?
What's the only thing scarier than a roster full of 5 star athletes?A roster full of angry 5 star athletes. 
tRuE FReShMen S H U T U P
Bama 2017-2019 national championships confirmed
Seams like it. Tua stated the 2nd half. No mention on radio about him being hurt.
You'd think maaaybe Cambridge, MA given they are home to the oldest university in the country, but hey I guess it's Georgia!
Jesus Christ.... Run forward.
“Can''t forget about that amazing play where Bama''s qb kept the drive alive with an amazing first down run made possible by an egregious block in the back/tacke we won''t mention”
Chubb is gonna lose them this game 
what year is he?
Damn my stream is on a delay
THAT CATCH
Let's goooo Bama
Why you running backwards?!
SUBSCRIBE
Chubb is having a worse game than Hurts
YOU FUCKING IDIOTS KEEP RUNNING BACKWARDS.
Y'ALL TRUE FRESHMAN QB!  TRUE FRESHMAN!
One of our frats lost their charter for doing that :(
goddamn what a catch
Stop running backwards you fucking dingii
Smart needs to stop calling outside runs, they aren''t doing shit.Georgia has decent success running between the tackles, idk why they dont stick to that
YES DID YOU KNOW THAT ONE OF THEM WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL THIS TIME LAST YEAR???
That's true, but thete would have been a different set of events. Maybe scoring or maybe not.
Look dawgs the refs screwed up bad, but stop runnin backwards
Jesus how many times are these runningbacks going to essentially get sacked? 
Jesus Christ Chubb quit running backwards
CMON NICK
I hope whoever is in charge of WatchESPN is fired. This buffering bullshit has been awful all season.
Michel has been doing better than Chubb give him the ball
Ford Tempos Alabama plates. Georgia State troopers. Smokey and the Bama.
I'm so sorry Georgia
Holy shit, that was a beautiful read by the corner.
Damn, Averett has some NICE ass tackling
MOMENTUM
Remind me! 2 minutes
I hope Tua wins this for us, but I do feel bad for Hurts. He is a great kid and has always been extremely respectful.
Damn dude Chubb hasn''t been having a good game 
Forgot Kendrick was doing Halftime for the game and I missed it.... :[
no, but i think tua might be
Did you hear??? there's 2 true freshman playing!! ×55
Stop running backwarss
Blocked punt shoulda been blown dead, so no blood no foul other than embarrassment for refs. Missed face mask woulda been 1st down instead of third and 21.  Missed tackle on 3rd and 7 killer in every way.
What a catch!
Chubb is getting mashed tonight...
I was about to say... AM I TAKING CRAZY PILLS HERE??  Guess it was the right call, but my god.  It caught me off guard.
BOTH OF THESE QUARTERBACKS CAN THROW THE QUICK SLANT WHAT THE FUCK 
After the Lions game, no way can ATL fans complain about refs lol
Hey now. Masoli is still playing pro football for ~$500k/year!
Sam Darnold. *someone had to say it*
Honestly bringing him out there as a rb would be a solid package.
Yep bama 1st half offense was not good. True frosh came in and from what i saw he looks scary. 
It's pretty rough. 
What a fucking tackle 
Georgia just needs to take what they can get and stop bouncing it for losses
Lowkey feel bad for Jalen Hurts...you know he was waiting for this all season and then he gets benched for a freshman. If Bama wins it's still gonna be bittersweet for him.
Pretty much accurate
Sorry,  but its time to bench Chubb 
They are locking down Chubb right now.
FAU to play with Lane?
Pretty sure the refs didn't make him take it out of the end zone
first row sports works
Literally the last one. The other one is stupid to want. 
lol this is a joke, right?  "FAVORITE TO WIN, WINS!"
Georgia players making stupid decisions resulting in big losses.
*Wooh wooh wooh*“You sound like a big choo choo train”
Kirk loves freshman, especially when they''re actually 18
Probably due to heavy traffic
Seems to be working so far
Fromm is showing up! What a show from the freshman.
Deal with the devil indeed ...
STOP SAYING TRUE FRESHMAN
Whas up y''all. Gotta wake up early tomorrow so Imma just say that no matter who wins this, Georgia has been playing one hell of a game and great job to the Dawgs for either the championship or the great game!
That went about as well as I thought it would
I'd love to see that 3rd down play...but watchespn...
Idk, ask Auburn fans
This is not a good game for someone who doesn''t like hearing the term “true Freshman”
Georgia's RB are good, but the instinct to go backwards needs to disappear.
oh god, bama is going to win this aren't they
But I''m still drinking
Bama is gonna do the thing aren''t they 
Refs then shit tackling, Tua had a nice run but no excuse for UGA not getting that sack. 
Oh God...
 < Be me, Jalen  < Be 25-2 < Only throw one INT in a whole year < Coach pulls me even though I am trying hard < 18 year old replacement fucks my girl raw < Feels bad man
Classic Big 12 style 13-7 QB duel 
Couple drives ago because Saban gonna Saban
it''s okay, at least this time we can blame it all on the refs
got two years of eligibility left
Oh that is bull shit. I was downvoted to hell early in the season for saying I think Tua should be playing. It was not a popular opinion in early October.
As soon as the game gets good the streams start shitting out. Great
BATTLE OF THE FRESHMEN!
watching this game is better with rice
Bitch hold on
Thanks!
This game just feels over lmaoEdit: NVM
Browns about to take Tua and Fromm in the 2020 Draft 
Bama #77 ankle wrapping a defender in that 3rd and 7 such a horrific hold. This officiating is off the charts. 
Hurry up Georgia I want to see Alabama on offense again
De dawgs du not noe de wey
Well the next 4 years suck. FR rules :(
!remind me
I only played HS football, 3 years w a righty and my senior year with a lefty, it was a big change for me playing OL  it took a while getting used to it before the season, I can''t imagine the change outta nowhere at half. I also wasn''t any good tho haha, and these are pretty good college players 
What?
Sad when illegal streams buffer less than the official espn one does. 
Sony save us 
Alabama making impossible standards to hold programs to. Now the SEC is going to make us hold freshman quarterbacks to unreasonable standards.
I hear they're both true freshman
So many shots......
Tony Brown always looks angry. Put that guy on my team pls
That 'Bama D is really stiff tonight
I, for one, am enjoying this turn of events
what the fuck is georgia doing?
"How good is this?"
True freshman? True freshman?! T-T-T-TRUE FRESHMAN!!!
When Bama gets that energy they''re scary as hell 
Creaming their pants at every catch throw and tackle and running play
Brady to Bama confirmed
Oh, Georgia sports. We've seen this movie before. 
Give Alabama''s defensive coordinator a raise for that
“How food is this??”  Um.  It''s been better, Kirk.  It''s been better. 
Nick churbb
Pick 6
[deleted]
TIL Fromm was in high school last year. 
Drink
All of it
100% of Jalen's
How many no calls does bama get this game? I'm just wondering
I feel like this is a very important drive for Georgia. 
**Jake Fromm Statefarm**
She's just some random girl.The force just drops everything in their laps, you know?
No
The Patriots are Bama''s spirit animal.They are literally connected by some quantum entanglement. 
A powerful, loud, toxic fanbase that has been spoiled 
That staff's incompetence when it comes to recruiting and evaluating HS guys cannot be overstated. 
Do the Youtube TV trail
Godwins so swaggy out there:(
Love Chubb, but hes too slow for this game
NCAA 2005 Update: LSU wents backwards on their last drive thanks to a key 2nd down sack so my Gators get to start at their own 45 with 3:07 to kill up 19-0
k got it.
9th of the season
If I had a penny for every time they said the word freshman, I'd be able to buy Disney
The fact that I have access to WatchESPN but have had to watch this entire game on a bootleg stream is honestly bullshit, they need to get their shit together.
Fromm is a type of dog food made in Wisconsin and Fromm is feeding the Bulldog right now. Edit: As I wrote this he threw a fucking bomb for the touchdown. Neat. 
nice shoelace tackle
OH MY GOD STOP RUNNING BACKWARDS
A roster full of angry 5 Star athletes who are all backed up by 5 Star athletes... 
That's why I picked 17+. If we win the second half by 30 or more that's bigger than eeking out a 3 point win due to the bullshit missed calls.
Had to put my daughter to bed, why is the backup QB in for bama?!
My Manager is a Georgia alumMy MD bet on AlabamaSo conflicted
When Alabama has momentum you can't run the ball, trust me
OH 
HOLY FUCK
Don't worry the B1G refs are saving their penalties for the week 1 ND UM game
North south, stupid RBs trying to get too tricky costing yards
Chubb kinda sucks
Why? Losing to The Greatest Coach in college football history isn''t anything to be ashamed of. Alabama has an extra week of rest and twice as many future NFL players.Win or lose, Georgia can hang their head high.
WOOO WOOO WOOO
Georgia is running backwards on purpose and the refs have Bama visors on... RIP Dawgs.... Jk lol
WHHHHHH
Also y'all need to stop running out of the gun. It's not working at allllll
You're hired as my new comment editor
Wow 
HELL YEAH!!!
YOU BEAUTY!!!!!!!!!!!
I thought Saban waited too long this season. He seems to be above the whole "starter doesn't lose his spot no matter what" but that's what it looked like he was doing this season,
Wowwwwwwwweew
Can we get Adam Amin and Joe Tessitore in the respective marching band uniforms
ONE change in momentum and the "muh Georgia sports curse" comments are in full force.EDIT:  HA!
Swear to God every time Georgia gets fucked back to the endzone the announcers are always like *gasp* this is going to be tough, and Fromm almost always nails a 10+ yard pass.
WHAT
HE GONE
YEssssss
WAOW
THE TRUE FRESHMAN DOES IT
^oh
WHAT A THROW
Just waiting for a made up penalty.
LOL rekt.
TD BABYYY
HAHAHAHHA Fuck Bama
HOLY SHIT
Saban evil genius and planned for no one being able to watch game tape of Tua?
YASSSSSSSS BIITTTCCCHHH
HELL YEA! Nice answer!
HOLY SHIT
Duuuuuude, don't run backwards.
MY GOD GEORGIA AGAIN!!!!!
Fuck your momentum
DIMES
Jesus how fucking delayed is my stream actually, I have no idea what this thread is commenting on
Nope.gif

Holy shit. What a throw and catch.

Touchdown!
TrUe FrEsHmAn 
*cluck*
little column A, little column B
Hartman is jesus

Lol bench Tony Brown
FROMM CLOUT 
FUCK YES
Holy shit momentum shift
Bruh, that Hawaiian kid lit up the offense. Idk why he should come back out. 
You can't decline fall start because the rest of the play never technically happened 
Tua comes in and wins off the bench as a fresheman
LOL
well shit
Oh 
BAH GAWD DEM DAWGS IS HELL
Any reports on what percentage of fans are Georgia fans?
holy shit
HOLY SHIT WHAT A BEAUTIFUL PASS
HOLY.FUCKING.SHIT.
Do you guys think that Sam Darnold would have it any other way?

WHAT A THROW
HUUUUUUUGE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Very good answer!
LETTS GO
\#MOMENTUM
IS THAT A CHOO CHOO TRAIN OUT THERE
what a fucking DIME
What if it was Saban''s master plan to have Hurts reveal all the secondary''s coverages and have Tua exploit them 
God was Ric Flair on the field for a second?
That was sick. 
WHAT A PLAY
FUCK BAMAAAAA
HOLY SHIT THAT THROW
What a throw! Holy shit!
Oh shit mama it''s on
I can't imagine a more boring uniform matchup than if this had been Bama/Oklahoma. It'd be like a spring game.

Urban Meyer:“Anyone have Jalen Hurts number? Asking for a friend”
RIP BAMA
Doubtful. Because they'll probably meet in the SECCG, which would serve as an elimination game most likely
Are you serious?
I can't believe I'm saying this but, you guys should be playing in this game right now.
ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED 
LMAO

[deleted]

TD gets called back bc refs still want bama to win
This is a good game
Whhhhat?
Of course there's a fucking flag lmao
God damn that was nice
1st half: B1G football.2nd half: Big 12 football.
Why is WatchESPN always such a trash stream?
Perfect throw Fromm.
Fromm can''t pass though
HOLY BALLSACK! WOW!
WHAT IS HAPPENING?!!
Holy shit
MY HEART
Holy shit what a game this has become 
oh shit, just realized if Tua becomes the full time starter next season then two SEC teams will have Hawaiians at QB
LETS GO
I like this game.
OH BOY
These Georgia players need to learn to run forwaards not back
Holy shit that was a beautiful ball
HARDMAN GOT ME HARD MAN
FIRE IN THE HOLEEEEE
Glorious explosiveness
wowza
What a perfect fucking throw
Insane.
FLAG
This is gonna be a crazy 2nd half. 
Holy fuck
God damn it what''s the flag 
Um...holy shit.
Of course Refs gotta throw a flag 
It's Fromm's world now!!
Damn hardman is fast as shit
OHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH^^^^Flag
Jake Fromn won't be outdone.
Stop bouncing, Chubb. It ends horribly.. plow ahead for a yard or 2.
Oh ffs if the refs call this back. 
THIS GAME THO
Lol refs.
That's why I rely on you humble folk to keep me updated with the play-by-play
Of course he fucking did, probably right before I tuned in. 
What the fuck is this bs flag? 
Did he step out when the db tried to tackle him? 
What is momentum
What a toss
Just what they needed if this stands anyways
HOLY FUCKING SHIT!!!
Hardman made up for the return
YEEEEESSSSSSS!
The blocked punt it whatever. If they called the False start it would have negated the block anyway.The no call on the facemask was maybe big since it halted the drive.Edit: Ooooooooo. But a new Touchdown is interesting.
Pick that flag up, damnit.
FUCK. THESE. REFS.
get fucked bama 
They're going to burn the stadium down if they call this back...
The FRESHMAN THE HUMANITY 
What.a.throw
I don't think he stepped out?!?!Edit: THAT WASNT THE PROBLEM FUCK YEAH
lol fuck me
Fromm is really impressing me.
Georgia toast biscuits and gravy. 
So what you're telling me is that the Oklahoma defense is literally dog shit?
Flag... pls no.
HOLY FUCK STOP RUNNING CHUBB IT'S NOT WORKING
I SWEAR TO GOD REFS
No please don't bring this back!
They Big12 now.
Incredible throw 
I've been thinking all game that Michel has looked *much* better
I take my eyes off the game for a SECOND and Bama scores?
OH OF FUCKING COURSE
OOOOOHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
REFBALL
Waiting for the flag on this play. Gotta be on UGA. 
Of course there would be a flag lol
Duck you 
So. I wonder which team will draft Jake Fromm #1 overall in 2020?
Speechless
What
Oh god not a flag
Don't worry bama the refs are here for you again
Boi if this is against Georgia
Of course there's a flag.
He definitely does, we're gonna need all the luck we can get.HYPE EDIT: OR NOT, FROMM IS LOVE FROMM IS LIFE 
*Looks for the flag*
Holy shit fromm can chuck it 
Oh shit
FLAG! ILLEGAL NOT BAMA SCORING!
There is no way he stayed in 
Beautiful play!
Wow that was a wobbly ball
He should just transfer to UT and be top dog again if he gets benched next year 
Kill Bill levels. 
FUCK YOU REFS
LMAO THAT DUDE WITH THE CIGAR
Good god, I need a lip right now
LORD JESUS ALMIGHTY
P O G C H A M P

I swear last drive I heard Kirk just say "true freshman" under his breath before the snap lol
Put that in your Tuabacco pipe and smoke it
Fuck Bama
lol
BLING BLAWWWW
FLAG FLAG
Nowhere he's #1 pick in the draft now. Saban got the NFL rule changed.
Hollllllllllly fuck
They are going to call it back.

[deleted]
Wow lol refs fucking Georgia 
Cigar and a Beer nice 
RIgged as fuck.
FLAG WTF
DAWG WILL HUNT
Fuck that!
CHOO CHOO MOTHERFUCKERS!
Well god damn that was a beautiful throw. 
Did that dude just have a cigar? Lol
Don't remember Averett at all before this game lmao.
NO FLAGS?
Flags
Oh really?
ITT: People who don''t realize ESPN makes the stream bad on purpose to punish cord cutters.
refs want Bass to win 
Fuck these refs! 
Lmao this is a fucking joke 
Woah, Fromm is really fucking good
FUCKING REFS
Damn what a throw
turnT
Holy schniekies!
JB could be good if he put on 40 lbs.  I'd also rather have Frenchy than Hurts.  Hockman will also be a sophomore, he could be good.  I just never understood the Hurts appeal
FROMM TO HARDMAN!!! FUCKING YES!!!You know, there was a time when they served full meals on a flight that long!
WHAT. THE. FUCK 
Tua has given Alabama a spark. Looks like they're gonna win this thing. 
Fromm: Nice drive Tua, check this shit out.
Oh thank god
Nut
Only the Browns 
Go fuck yourselves refs! LOL. Great pass
Let's goooooooooo
HOLY SHIT! HOLY SHIT! HOLY SHIT!
Of course
They are gonna find a way to call this against georgia
Are you kidding me with these infants at QB?
THROW A FLAG ON THAT YOU BITCHESEdit: lmao I knew it
Flag for scoring on Alabama
In case you didn''t know, THAT KID IS A FRESHMAN
He didn't even celebrate all he did was look back.
Fromm clearly wants to win the 2nd Half True Freshman QB contest
FUCK
I THOUGHT THAT PENALTY WAS ABOUT TO NEGATE IT LMAO
Shout out to the guy smoking 
The Chubb hate is hilarious. HE IS PLAYING AGAINST ALABAMA HE ISNT GOING TO RUN FOR 250 YARDS 
bahahaha
That was scary af
L0L
Well, that was a little interesting. 
NEVERMIND FUCK THESE REEFS
THIS. IS. THE. GAME. WE. ALL. WANTED.
Uh holy fucking shit
I knew I was waiting for a ref to come up with some bullshit reason to call it back.Edit:  Good, it didn't call it back.Edit 2:  Fuck that, refs finding a way to bring it back anyways.
That's fine.
Sweet baby Jesus 
Was that UGA motherfucker smoking a cigar in the stadium lol
Is this the first QB for Bama from the islands?
WHAT THE FUCK
Chubb is shit tonight.
[deleted]
That was scary lmao
#FLAG GATE
Oooowee that was a pretty throw, had forgotten what that looked like after the first half
OH MY FUCK
lolwut
FUCK YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Justify it after the game so you can be happy regardless
Georgia brought something from our match vs them to this game. I was kinda hoping bama would get shut out so our offense would look amazing.
This hasn''t been the best game but I am still watching
That was absolutely bonkers 
## OH MY GOD!!!
LETS GO DAWWGGSSS
holy shit!!!! what a bomb!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Thank you Jesus!
YEE BOI
Christ 
ITS OK
Lol wow
Oh no flag, fuck that was beautiful though
Yeah!!!! Now for the review. 
I was about to rage lol
HOLY SHIT
probably. totally worth it. 
What??????
***RIGGING INTENSIFIES***
this is a rule ive never seen enforced like that. 
WERTH IT
LET THE BIG DAWGS EAT!!!
What the Hell.
[chUGA chUGA](https://media3.giphy.com/media/FXo3Din7pWybK/giphy.gif)
Alabama will have too much energy if they don't. Let the hogs wear-out the D-line and it will give you time to throw later. Start-out throwing, and you'll be facing pressure the whole time.
TOUCHDOWNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN
Close to some major refball there
these refs want alabama to win so bad LOOOOOL they aren't even trying to hide it 
What a beautiful throw
Jacob Fromm said fuck your couch nick saban!
Those crowd reactions were amazing
Wow almost had a heart attack
GODDAMN!! What a fucking catch! 
At least they scored?
FUCK YES JAKE FROMM
Whew, touchdown is good.
LET'S GO BABY!!
Sideline interference? What the fuck? Where?
If they took that fucking touchdown back........
HOLY FUCKING SHIT! 
SIT DOWN REF
TOUCHDOWN DAWGS
What a Rollercoaster, jesus
ohh well thats lucky
Almost
Georgia: fuck refs, fuck momentum, were going to win this ourselves 
FUCK YEAH
Holy shit.
FUCK YEAH
IT STILL STANDS
lol whew, that was an amazing TD
omg i thought the refs stole another one from UGA.
Jake Fromm
Game is good now. 
Huh
Of course there''s a flag. Fuck off. Always finding a way to fuck over Georgia.
We need a new pants holder. 
FUCK A 15 YARD PENALTY. DEM DAWGS IS HELL!
that just happened!
WOW.
TECHNICAL FOUL
I am very surprised.
Omfg
refs better not try it
That's...a penalty call...
Has this become a shootout??
lol kirby when he realized they keep the td
That was an amazing throw and catch.
I screamed “no” as soon as Fromm threw it 
OH thank God lol
goshdarn Aaron Unitas. 
HERE COMES THE REFS
SHOW THE INTERFERENCE
OH MY GOOOOOOOOOOOOOD
That was beautiful 
holy shit!!!
Thank fuck
Holy shit
FUCK BAMA
Oh fuck off, wait it''s good, okay nvm 
I was about to melt if they called that back 
WHERE THE FUCK IS PANTS GUY?!?!
Jake Fromm is definitely going to play in the NFL.
that was a good pass
THANK FUCK
That's how you fucking respond. Go Dawgs!
Kirby's pants guy has lost control!!
Ball don't lie, Bama! Ball. Don't. Lie.
Hardman MVP 
Lol how many millions are watching the watchespn stream? Illegal streams are under way less traffic. 
Holy shit what a response. I was ABSOLUTELY convinced that was coming back just because these refs have no chill.
Updated short list of people most likely to never start another game at QB for Alabama :Greg McElroyJalen Hurts
FUCK OFF REF! Where's the warning? Horse shit refs 
Wow. Fucking wow. What a throw!
Ok that play was absolutely insane. Props to #4, that was incredible 
Well, at least the TD stands.
#WUT
FUUUUCK YESSSSSSS
Shit refs are you fucking kidding me with these calls
These refs are ass my dude.
"Oh man this game is so boring!"Anyone still whining?
How does that not nullify the TD? That's stupid.
It was there, but it didn't erase the TD
Regardless you get into the national championship by earning it in the regular season. Your fitness for the playoffs isn''t decided retroactively after winning a game in it. 
Whew lads lmao
BAMA JUICING THE REFS!
Holy shit was that an awesome play!
This is most definitely probably rigged. Yep, definitely rigged maybe. 100% maybe rigged.
OMFG heart attack
Coach wrangler do your job
I swore when that ball was thrown it would be picked. Happily wrong
LOL If they'd taken away that TD Georgia would be in flames
Holy shit refs want bama to win so bad
BRUH WHAT The FUCK?!?!?!?!?!?#I SAID, what tHA FUCK!?
yeah lol Swift did that shit a bunch in hs and got away with it but that's not gonna work against bama
Sideline infraction? yo belt wrangler, wake up!
WHAT IS THIS GAME LMFAO
Holy shit. My butthole got real tight right there. 
Huh what the hell
Hey refs fuck youuuuuuuu
Y'all laughed at us for our claim, but seeing how passing the ball and QB scrambles is the only way either team is actually moving the ball, I don't think its unreasonable to think we would be having more success on offense than either of you. And neither of your QB's look half as good as Stidham did vs. us so.... you can see how this is turning into me thinking we would win. 
There you go. I was 100% certain that one was coming back.
The Browns will draft their 4th consecutive #1 QB
Kirby''s handler not doing his damn job
Sideline interface? When was the last time that was called?
That was fucking beautiful :') 
SIDELINE PENALTY ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME?
HOW BOUT THEM DAWGS
hahaha wtf
WHAT A THROW AND CATCH!!!
FUCK BAMA! #4 THE MVP
still the Browns lul
Kirby's belt boy has failed him
DAWGS ON FIREEEEE
the refs wanted to take away georgia's touchdown so bad lol
What's that? A penalty against Georgia as they score a TD? Who would've thought.
wtf is this game right now
Where the fuck was Kirby''s belt guy?!?!?
WEW LAD
FRESHMAN DICK SWINGING CONTEST ENGAGED
Holy fuck that was a lucky it was a dead ball foul
Browns
God damn, what a response 
Refs: "not so fast, my friend"
Fuck off refs.
Georgia answers holy hell
WHERE IS KIRBY SMARTS HOLDBACK GUY 
This buffering brought to you by watchESPN
OMGGGGGGGGGGGG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Refs want to make it out of here alive.
Oh man, the ref conspiracy was about to become too real
Ref trolled Kirby so bad
CHOO FUCKING CHOO
That was Rodgers hail Mary level arc
Jesus Christ I thought that was coming back
well that escalated quickly 
What the fuck
That's a f'ing throw.  Nice to see some actual quarterbacking show up in the second half.
HOLY SHIT WHAT A THROW
Fuck yes!
I swear I keep hearing the [imperial alert](https://youtu.be/AfuQd_xZlKw)
Thank God.Because I was about to break my TV if they took that away 
I''d say yes
[deleted]
THAT'S HOW YOU FUCKING RESPOND!
Wait what? So can you interfere to have your guy score a TD and it counts? Or was it after the play?
Saban picked up voodoo black magic from his stint at LSU.
Holy shit I legit thought they would do anything to overrule that TD. 
ok someone explain to me what the fuck is going on.
Now this is more exciting 
This is the most obvious bought ref bullshit. 
Ah yes, legendary Titans QB, Mariota.
What was that flag for?
GEORGIA DID COCAINE AGAINGO DAWGS
That's fucked, that should be coming back. coming onto the field should be treated as interfering with the play and should be a live ball foul.
That pass was pure sexiness.
HOLY SHIT BOYS!
FUCK YOU ALABAMA DEFENSE YOU CHEAP DIRTY COCKY FUCKS.
Touchdown still good holy shit I thought they were gonna say illegal touching or whatever 
Oh shit son. 
Holy crap my app crashed right when he scored from all the traffic
Yoooooooooooo
Why does that count as a touchdown if the interference happened DURING the play? 
yeah that was awesome lmao
OH GOD I ALMOST THOUGHT THAT FLAG WAS THE REFS SAVING BAMA
What a bomb of a pass
Fuck it.  I'll give up 15 yards on a kickoff for 7 points all day.
Atlanta would have been set on fire yet again if that was overturned
What the fuck is that penalty. They accidentally made up one that doesn''t take the touchdown back stupid refs!
Lol wut
can't make it too easy for Tua this is all part of the story 
That didn't really change much. The play should've been blown dead with a false start. 
What a throw from Fromm!
I didn't know Mike Tomlin was on the sideline
Good shit that''s goood shit right there gooooood shit
OMFGGAGHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
That was such a gorgeous pass
Refs tried...
What a beautiful throw that was.
Relaxxxxxx
Kirby thought it was coming back for a second
That referee gets to live.... hooray. 
Dis shit gettin gud
Not even trying to hide the bullshit. Fuck the refs. 
BAMA HAS NO CHOICE BUT TO RESPOND WITH POINTS HERE. GEORGIA HAS THE MOMENTUM IN FULL AFTER THAT BEAUT
Whaaaa???
Not to live in the past but Osborne did it against Miami in 94Saban = Osborne confirmed
He looks very scary. His release time is insanely quick and has power. 
That flag almost killed me until he said it was on the kickoff. Thank god. Thought the fix was in for a second lol. 
BAMA JUST GOT IT FROMM BEHIND
Wow what a lucky call there. Hell of a play and it stands.
Lol, refs HAD to do something. Lmao
I was worried that was coming back. Whew!
wtf was that penalty? ive never heard of size line deferrence
Fuck you
Smart: There''s something I ought to tell you. I''m not left-handed either!
So did literally everyone
"Yeah, I'm not nullifying that shit and digging us into a bigger hole" - refs
Wow. That throw is one thing I didn't expect to see in this game.
Jalen is going to have a fantastic career at Jacksonville State. 
GEORGIA!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Daaaaaaamn.
Unbelievable throw and catch! This is huge to take the momentum back. 
whew
You blink again and Georgia hits a 80-yd TD
FUCK YOOOOOOOOU REFS!
This 3rd quarter, wow. Freshman QBs out here slingin' it.
Oh wowsers
Tony Brown can take all that shit talking and shove it up his ass now getting roasted 
bring back the rose bowl refs!
Cue Owen Wilson “Wow!”
fRoMm CaN't PaSs
RIDICULOUS CALL
Oh man, if that hadn't been a dead ball foul, those refs would have been torn apart by rabid Dawg fans, on the field.
What was the flag?
Bam!
T H I C C E R
Gundy is such a redneck!Watch the game on the filmroom ESPN news
This is the week of voice cracks
It's really impossible to not be the case. 
that dude is fast.
"Signaling it's going to come back"Plz no. 
Lol I thought they were gonna take the trash away cause of that flag. Would''ve been crazy 
YEET
We are the worst 3rd down defense in the country apparently. 
What a god damn throw
You cant root for uga with that flair you disgrace us
just saw it live sry
Georgia scores? Aaand there's the flag.
thought he was overthrown for sure, wow
Bama''s got a few extra players in black-and-white
There were three huge balls on that throw. Two of them were Fromm''s 
Fromm....I just love you!
Refs gonna Call a foul on the sideline for not being closer
Holy. Shit. 
My god we've got somethign resembling a footbawl game boys!
$$$ BAMA $$$ REFS $$$
HOLY SHIT
Kirby Smart almost ate the ref there like the real Kirby.
Second half is best half
So like why not have him as a season starter
That ref buried the lead
"Not so fast bitches." -- Refs
Mark Richt died for this.
HOLY S-H-I-T.  What a damn throw
Jesus Christ what a throw. 
THICCCCCC
Wait, what is that call? 
HARDMAN MAKES ME HARD, MAN
Cleveland Browns
No warning?
Dont screw them refs
So what happened on the sideline? 
That was clutch as hell. Go Dawgs!
***HARDMAN! YOU MOTHERFUCKING DAMN GOOD DAWG! MAKE UP FOR THAT KICKOFF YOU DAWG!***
Let''s just turn this into a shootout
Refs maybe just saved their lives. 
This is my 1st national championship game I've ever watched. That was mad neat!
Review time ad time
great way to answer back
lol, The B1G officials are dicks if you are anywhere near them
I would gamble and put my money on yes. Younger guy that proved himself in the biggest game of them all.
But hey, it''s actually a game now. 
I was ready to shut off the TV and just stop watching if they called that back. Jesus.
Trying to imagine someone that comments on the flag before knowing what it is
Touchdown Alabama! - these Refs, probably 
What the fuck... 
I watched both homer calls on ESPN3. The Alabama commentators are so much more homer-y than Georgia. Get your shit together and kiss your own team's ass more Georgia commentators! Embarrassing.
What a broken tackle!
Refs have no chill 
Y no go for 2?
GO FOR TWO!!!
What the fuck is that shit?
THICKER DEFENSIVE BACK
OH BABY
Anyone else play Magic: the Gathering like 20 years ago and remember the creature "Chub Toad"?
omfg every georgia fan had a heart attack for a second I bet
Well that penalty was a fucking roller coster
[deleted]
Christ Georgia, go for 2
First half was a run heavy slugfest.  Guess it's shootout time.
Damn that''s impressive. I''m not even mad.
ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME
Just wait...
Refs making a sideline call in the National Championship? Give me a break. If I'm Georgia I just kick it out of bounds.
Flag on the play: Play that didn''t benefit Bama. 
What just happened?
Too easy, gg. Fromm you scary
I want a shootou
That was some great SEC defense right there
Yeah, luckily he has managed to overcome the language barrier
Guys, this is all my fault. I yelled Roll Damn Tide at a Bammer today. 
if that shit came back the salt levels wouldve exploded
ROT IN HELL YOU SODOMITE PIECES OF SHIT
Did they just call a guy "big and thick"?
Come on Tua. Deliver us. Be the goddamn hero who literally comes out of nowhere 
Of course it is
DIS GON BE GOOD
Both these QB''s are gonna be in the SEC for up to 3 more years.
No chromecast from my phone to the tv so thats probably it.  Firetv for watch espn. 
Refs need to decide the score! Don't take this away from them, pesky players!
Jake “Aaron Rodgers” Fromm
Booooooooo fuck these refs 
This flag is bringing it back isnt it? 
Bass to trout 
Damn nice throw
Refs are like fuck we have to call something.
Wow I thought for sure they were going to take that TD away. 
He is in.
~~Fuck these refs~~
What a touchdown, holy fuck.
WHAT IS HAPPENING
tHE gAmE IS RiGgED
What a roller coaster of a penalty call 
B1G refs can eat my goddamn ass
T R U E F R E S H M A NRUEFRESHMAN
So Bama still get some yards when Georgia scores a 80-yard td lol
T H I C C
Lmao I don't think it was lit but still hilarious
"Saban! Your Tua Card is no match for my Frommagic Card" ~ Kirby Smart
Or maybe not..
#Cue X-Files
SEC after dark 
[MFW](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mUhcRm5060)
Jesus Fucking Tapdancing Christ, refs
OH FFS
Ooh, more commercials!
I've been listening about 5 mins, and there's too many people with mics on the sidelines.
Pretty surprised Bama is getting killed so badly on 3rd and longs 
Kirby's fucking face when he was salty af then heard "td is good" and he just went to nodding and agreeing lmao. Fuck me I'm going to bed.
Fuck of with the reviews Alabama. 
gotta show that you're a true southern gentleman at all times
Quick refs! Throw a flag!Edit: WOW THEY ACTUALLY DID
fucking drew brees snuck in for UGA
> This is a rule I''ve never seen enforced ~~like that~~FTFY
####YES
They review every dawg play omg 
Bigger, THICCer
This game just got turned the fuck up
Fromm, you beautiful bastard! Go Dawgs!
First QB ever in CFB from the islands 
Also known as the Tom Savage conundrum .
My father in law says "that Mexican quarterback..."
God daaaaamn. Bet no one expected that.
T h i c c defensive back
stands easy stands
hey, im just a man with an opinion. never claimed to be a smart man with an opinion.edit: nvm turns out im wicked smart after all
THEM GOOD BOYES IS HELL
Refs still trying......
Why? Why are they reviewing this?
Oooo fuck. His heel was out.
DAMNNN
Even on a TD they still find a way to penalize Georgia
Do they review Every fucking play
He never went out of bounds 
"Bigger, thicker defensive back"
The place would riot if they took it back.
This is still bama Georgia right? Two defensive, rushing SEC teams??
What is happening?
what a crazy call
That is close...
Wow its nice to watch good QB play again(Watson plz come back, we miss you)
Actually every dead ball penalty would not nullify the touchdown 
Lmaoo
Hold off on that until we see how Bama responds
IN
How many knew that allows the TD to count 
You can't say flaggate 
Come on B1G refs...holy shit.  When do you get sideline interference calls
The score on this game is gonna be higher than Jalen Hurts hairline. 
This is bullshit
So I wonder where Jalen Hurts will be transferring to? 
I hate these refs.
McDonough needs to work on his voice cracks
Dem dawgs is hell
I'm hyperventilating now. Jesus is it just Monday?
LOL just jerking us around
B I G G E RT H I C C E R
Dat heel...
If thy call this back fuck this game and fuck CFB
Holyshit, they let the TD stand with that penalty?? lol ok
"Much Thiccer defensive back"Two C's
Never in my life have i seen that penalty on a championship game.. alabama its beyknd obvious you have a ref blowing u 
How is a sideline interference during the play a dead ball foul
Reddit ref conspiracy theories..go!!!
And y'all were worried 
That's out 
Holy fuck I just felt every emotion twice 
Fuck me
he stayed in
Sideline infraction of some kind.
WE LOVE THICC DB''s 
The refs are tryin real hard to give Bama the win right here
Oooh vvv close with the heel 
Man these refs really want to work for the PAC12. 
I saw that throw with my own eyes, but I still don't believe it. Incredible.
I thought there was about to be a riot
[deleted]
Man thats a touchdown 
Yeah idk what people want. This isnt some cupcake
Least celebrated 80 yard bomb TD ever?
The flag looked like a banana
i see your Freshman QB and raise you mine 
my bootyhole was puckering waiting for the ref's call
Refs
Alabama's weakness is players who wear #4
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHHA
Sip sip
He wasn't out. Stop wasting time.
Holy crap he hit the guy OB that kept him inbounds. 
DAT ASS!
[deleted]
Refs are dog shit
Saban:  And this is to go even further beyond!  TUUUUUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
My heart stopped for 8 seconds jesus
Its ok Tiger, bro. I still love you.
Let''s see a replay of that sideline interference because based on some recent calls it was probably a BS call.
Do they have to review every Georgia play but not any Alabama ones??
He''s in!
/r/cfb
Does his heel hitting the defender make him out? 
People are here drinkin hahahahaha
MAN! this is a freakin fight! I love it.
And now they''re gonna see if he step out of bounds. Refs trying to find a way to fuck UGA
GEORGIA FOR THE LOVE OF COLLEGE FOOTBALL. PLEASE DONT CHOKE THIS GAME. 
That was such a baller throw, this UGA team is just fun.
Can't overturn that
Fuck BAMA get Bitches
Fuck these refs
To that guy who''s job it is to hold Kirby''s pant. YOU HAD ONE JOB
what a fucking dime
BOOOOOOOOOOOO
hey guys, Fromm is pretty good at football 
If his foot hits a bama player who is OB is he OB?
Refs almost got there. You silly bastards. 
Hey there is the flag
LMAOOO FUCK YOU REFS
That was a fucking beautiful throw. Shiiit. 
CLOSE BUT NO CIGAR DONT FUCK THE DAWGS NOW YOU ZEBRAS
Still hate the officials so much
Did Alabama qb get injured or was he benched
Say whaaaaa?
I was about to shoot my TV if the refs took that TD away.
Not enough to overturn.
ESPN sucks at showing replays.  They'll show the sideline for 2 minutes though
WUT???That was a rollercoaster.  
The DB is T H I C C 
Wow the refs have amazing eyes when Georgia has the ball!
MECOLE!!!
Thank goodness the score counts.
Saban paying these refs
of course they review it after
Can''t overturn that. 
Lol the salt will pour in now
Crab legs. 
these reviews keep killin ma buzz
Lol, they're going to call him out.
Refs fucking interfering as fuckkkkkkk
TD
Incredible that we got two true freshman playing like this on this stage.
Fuck
C O M M E R C I A L S
Nice username lol
I think his foot touched the OOB Bama player.
Missed the TD. Sweet stream ESPN.
If that flag negated the TD this place would have exploded.
They're gonna get him for that heel, aren't they.
Browns. who else?
Jesus Christ, every UGA play is reviewed. 
Way to fucking throw fromm holy shit 
Is this the NFL?  a whole lotta refball right now....
**things happenin'**
Saban proves once again he can't coach. Fired after this game regardless of the outcome.
Mother. Fuck. These. Refs. 
its a shit show
Great angle lol
Better stand
Out
Can the refs be any more on Bama''s dick!???!?!!
He's in
What a throw from Fromm and what a good route. Especially with all that momentum going Bama's way. Unbelievable. 
Just like the NFL
Areyousureaboutthat.jpeg
SHOW. ME. THE. PENALTY. REPLAY.
Fucking WOW. Wow motherfucking WOW.
Georgia having to beat the Elephants AND the Zebras
lefuckyoubomb
If this come backs I'm going to be so disappointed.
Theyre going to call this shit back
Jesus fuck, Fromm is damn good.
These refs are trying so fucking hard to keep UGA down 
God, I can''t wait till fucking Tony brown leaves. Fuck
incoming "rigged" comments
Fromm bomb 
That should come back.
Ref tried to help Kirby up, but he got up by himself.
That single call on the punt is a 14 point swing. UGA should have been on the Alabama 15 year line to start the drive Alabama just scored on. 
I think he's in
It's so close, I think the call should stand
First half: 13-0. Final score: 53-49.
Took a chance on the rush and couldn't get to him. Georgia front is winning the battle.
not even close to undisputable evidence.    dont rig the game refs
Especially without a warning 
Are you fucking watching this. OH MY FUCKING GOD.
Of course we have to review it 
Oh no bby what is that one Alabama assistant doing just standing there staring into space 
[deleted]
DID YOU GUYS KNOW THAT THERE ARE TWO FRESHMEN PLAYING QUARTERBACK IN THIS GAME?
Hahahahahahah FUCK BAMA
tRuE fReShMaN QuArTeRbAcKs
Fucking refball.Edit:  Thank god, they let it stand.
Ugh its coming back
Can you overturn that?
Such BS
[deleted]
MUCH THICCerya let em know herbie
About as close as it gets.
Alabama #2''s having a bad day 
Glory glory to ole Georgia, and to hell with big ten refs 
Ooh that's outEdit: I thought
That's not even close to overturn.
He''s in bounds
I honestly hate B1G refs so fucking much. 
3RD AND PRUITT STRIKES AGAIN
NOT ENOUGH TO OVERTURN
This is going to go from a defensive game to a shootout. 
[Hardman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ilkQgXoH1o)
Something something Harbaugh. 
Looks like Georgia has to beat Alabama AND the refs too.
THICC
You know God forbid they ever show us the replay of the biggest play of the game which is an 80 yard touchdown.God forbid.
Is it the same as the NFL if you touch an out of bounds player it's out?
Bench
Damn I think he might be out
Heel was in what's the penalty?
If only the player on the sideline had grabbed a bama player by the facemask maybe the official wouldnt have noticed 
This isn''t football. This isn''t what replay was designed for. Edit: thank god they didn''t overrule it. 
If his foot touches a player that is out of bounds is that out of bounds?
I dont think hes out
Oh I see what you were going for.  Probably should have been clearer TBH.  That is a pretty good story.
These refs are trying to get murdered in the parking lot
That could honestly go either way.
That boy's got some legs
Oooof
Fuck me that''s stupidly close
Yep he's out. Close but out 
THESE REFS ARE PAWNS 
All you people that called it for alabama after their td can eat a bag of dicks.You overreactionary thread fillers are the reason we even need 4 separate threads. You're all bullshit.
Pixel gate
After the refs fucked them last drive, I'mma be hella pissed if they take this
There is no way that is irrefutable evidence. 
Can his foot touch a player that is out of bounds?
I'm confused. Did the interference occur during a live play? I really don't understand how the play would stand if there was a penalty during live play.
Not enough to overturn.
Can't overturn
And they will call it back because it''s Alabama. 
Too close to overturn.
Damn, that's really close.
Fuck Bama!Completely unrelated, anyone know how I can marry one of the Bama baton girls?
That couldn't be closer.
I think that''s out.
This game, man.
Atlanta would have burned down if that TD was brought back on some bullshit sideline interference penalty.
oh deer, contact with a guy out of bounds
That's as close as it gets. 
Refs have ignored 3 different obvious calls on Bama, have called lots of ticky tack bullshit on UGA.
They got money on the game.
did anyone actually see what happened on the sideline?
Get fucked Alabama!
So what was caused the penalty?
the line isn''t even fucking straight
Benched
that's not even a straight out of bounds line lol
L O N G B A L L 
That man is a hard man
not enough to overturn, i think
This is a load of bullshit. Fuck outta here refs.
Oh overplayed to oblivion no doubt but I like it p.s. I'm new to r/cfb so pls forgive me
Not enought to over turn....Touchdown!NEXT!
time to pull out the index card!
He's out of bounds
Oh what the fuck.
Let that stand 
I think this play stands, looks like he''s in by a hair 
He''s out
And if Bama wins, both co-national champs will both have Hawaiian QBs!
You must have missed the Washington penn st game
golly gosh thats close gotta leave it. call stands
That's pretty close
That touchdown brought to you by **TRUE FRESHMAN**, Jake Fromm. Fun fact, he's a **TRUE FRESHMAN**.
The refs are really trying to stop UGA to lose
That's how you answer!
Lol that is so close
You cannot overturn that
That looks out
WHAT
Damn his foot is perfectly flush, he''s in 
I was about to apologize for my conferences shitty refs....and I still do apologize for my conferences ref's shitty-ness...at least they didn't fuck up the touchdown
;)
Stands! 
Is this game about to become lit? 
Holy smokes that''s close
Stayed inbounds 
not enough to overturn
FUCKING GIVE IT TO THEM
how many blades of grass constitute being in bounds?
That line isn't even straight.
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Out, he is out. 
Every scoring play right
You know they can
This is why everyone should wear white cleats lol 
Too close to call.  That is TD.
That's actually extremely close. 
Red really trying to swing the MO to Bama
That''s as close as you can possibly get 
I wasn't going to watch this bc SEC but.... PLZ UGA PLZ
literally atoms between his heel and the white
Fix is IN
amazing way to answer back
Big balls Fromm
These are the fucking Dawgs I know. Keep chopping, TD or not!!!
T H I C C
holy shit, the gradient of the sideline is actually relevant here.
They over turn this shit I'm gonna blow up
https://youtu.be/AtNoPP8yYic?t=3s
Touching the player that's OB....does that mean anything?
Thank you god 
I don't think they can overturn that
Out of bounds reviews are my favorite 
FROMM
I agree
Cmon
Wtf I''ve never even heard of that penalty before
that was out but ok
Edit. I'll still shut it off if they call it back. 
Still could
Benched
The bar I''m at has no volume. Wtf was the flag 
What was the sideline interference for 
My internet is pretty good and I still missed that whole TD play because of buffering on WatchESPN.
Not enough to overturn 
That was quick for how close that was
There ya go refs
He was out
This is true.
#MILLIMETER CLOSE
That's a touchdown, without question
HELL YEAH
[deleted]
He's thiqq
No shit.  
True.
That''s the right call
S T A N D STANDS
The sideline isn't even straight 
Way to close
WOAHHHHHHHH
Fuck yeah
No way you overturn that.
That looked parallel to the line i.e. not intersecting it
YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
What? He was out.
So I thought if you touched an out of bounds dude it made you out of bounds. Guess not.
Come on Nickie what the fuck is you doing. 
"Not confirmed, but stands." No shit
Fuck alabama
OH COME THE FUCK ON
Game is totally getting broke open by players we've hardly seen before.  I'm cool with that.
T H I C C E R
Wowee that was a mess. 
BANG BANG BANG
Stands
YEET
It stands!!!!! Fuck you Bama!!!!
Nevermind.
FUCK YES!
Refs redeemed
WOW I WAS FULLY EXPECTING THEM TO TURN THAT OVER 
IF THEY OVER TURN THIS ITS OBVIOUS THEY'VE BEEN PAID OFF
To the aussie. Thats why the big dudes hold coaches by the belt. 
Fuck
Good call refs
No way you could over turn that. 
Bullshit
What is the sideline violation? 
Goodbye Alabama.
ESPN's stream of this game-- snapped into high def not even once
[deleted]
Announcers rooting for Bama??
Sideline interference???
Place his foot and get the notecard
Good grief
What a play 
Good call from the refs. Too close to tell, gotta go with the call on the field.
That was quick for a play that was so close
Flag didn't nullify the TD? Break the replay out boys this isn't over
So hard to tell
That was close a.f.
Way too close to overturn
makeup call
S T A N D S
God damn
the defender got kicked while laying out of bounds. does that make the runner out (touching a point out of bounds)? Guess I never really thought of how that works in football. Could you stiff arm off a defender for balance who is already out?
Verne Lundquist -"Oh My!" *Chortles uncontrollably*
I think I'm more shocked they didnt go to commercial 
Tua: "Bitch please" *licks lips*
This is as bad as a 10 minute review for offsides in hockey. Get the fuck out of the way refs and let the kids play. Christ.
Like tennis....
How the fuck is this still going?  I''m talking about the refs. 
HE WAS OUT!!!!!!
Wanna talk cursed sports?  How about Minnesota?  No championship since 1991, and all 4 of our teams have had painful playoff losses since.
If the flag is thrown in the play, how is it a dead ball penalty?
Can't overturn that. 
Should go for two if you're UGA
"We've given Bama the last 3, Georgia can have this one"
WOW LETS GO!!!!
He's out if the defender is out and touching him, right?
Wtf he was out 
Bencharoo'd
Fair enough, first time there's anything on the line.
That's what I've heard. I guess this is what I get for not watching the game.
WOW. I thought they were going to call that TD back. 
a w a r d i t 
I was 10000% sure it was getting overturned. Wow.
Unclench now Dawgs.
FROMMBOMB
DAMB
PHEW
I want this game to be a back and forth battle between the QBs kinda like Keith Price vs. RG3 in the 2011 Alamo Bowl
Fuck yes and fuck bama
GO DAWGS GO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
refs redeemed with that one 
Correct call
fuck off ref lmao
Refs want to take the game from Georgia so bad LOOOOOOOOL. They're going to try anything they can
If they overturn this touchdown I will be livid
ROLLER COASTER OF EMOTIONS
Wow im shocked! Good call
They didn't take it away!!!
WOOOOOOOOOOOO LEGGO BOYS
lmao....These refs are doing everything they can to rig this for Bama.
Holy fuck.
Im all for that touchdown, but how could "sideline interference" not nullify the touchdown??
Fowler rooting for Bama here pretty clearly. Thank God Herbie is in the booth to keep things sane
He was out. Wow.
How many quarters have you waited to say this?
Shouldn''t*
SHEEESH what a fucking throw
That was a makeup call! Good call refs!
too close to overturn
Fromm's arm is the truth.
Good job not overturning to close to call
That's not enough to come back. Thank god
Can confirm
No, remember the catch in the first half where his shin stayed in because it landed on the defender out of bounds?
not rigged confirmed.
Nope
Both teams got the "secret stuff" from Spam Jam at half time
FUCK YES!
There was a ref looking right at this. It better stand as called
Now did the back of his foot hit out of bounds?
And butts all over Georgia are unclinched. 
That's *real* fucking close. Stands is the correct call.
Wow! Did not expect that!
That's actually genius 
That was surprisingly quick
Not enough to overturn. 
Ohh come on, that's not to enough to overturn it
Make up call I reckon.
No chance that could've been overturned. Stands is the right call. 
Sideline interference 
Yeah probably would''ve gotten smoked like at the Iron Bowl. 
Georgia deserved that one
thank you refs
I think that is too close. Good call.
Yup, not enough to overrule.
Lol "that was the first controversial review"...ok
Calling it now, Jake Fromm is the next starting QB of the New England Patriots. 
I thought he was out of bounds but you can't overturn a call based on that.
Jesus these refs blow.
Double confirmed TD. One more time to the booth.
they took a blocked punt give us that one lol
My god just give it to him we want to see some actual football.
Sideline interference
Sideline interference 
The way his heel landed honestly probably a millimeter between actually being on the line. 
Wow I''m surprised flag on UGA and review. Still a TD!
The refs aren't biased, they've just been drinking.
That was clooooooooose
Yay inboundz
Yeah, there wasn't anything conclusive there
He lives again...
Sideline interference. 
benched
HAHAHA HE USED THE BAMA DEFENDER TO STAY IN BOUNDS
stands as called, right call
Good call, not enough to overturn. Refs are only semi-ass now my dude
what was the sideline interference call? I didn't see it happen
We need to get a folded slip of paper or somethin 
So where was the penalty? 
THIS GAME IS INCREDIBLE HOLY SHIT CONTROVERSYYYYYY
Save us Tua
Sideline interference
sideline interference
You''re a smart man
that's the sideline interference 
If they overturned that I would've quit watching football.
Refs can kiss my ass if they took that one away 
Looks like there's *maybe* one white blade of grass under his cleat. Good call to keep the ruling on the field
What the hell was that penalty for?
"refs cheating for Bama"
DAMMIT
Sideline. Dead ball
Sideline interference.  Dead ball foul
sideline interference on Georgia
Damn that was close
Oh fuck off Kirk
He was 100% inbounds.
I like how quick that review was compared to the NFL
He looks out.  Why even have replay if they can't get it right.
Sideline interference
Sideline 
Sideline interference. Probably on Kirby.
Everything is ok!
Oh good, these refs do have some humanity left...
He's out.
Sideline interference.
Sideline interference on Georgia.
Need a microscope for that one
Stay off the field Kirby 
"These refs are blatantly fucking over Georgia"
Right call, not enough evidence 
Lol the refs tried 
If they called that back I was gonna stop watching this shit 
THAT CATCH WAS FUCKING INSANEEEEE
No warning,  refs are fucking corrupt af
Did Kirk just take a big bite of hotdog before that take? wtf was that?
M A K E U P C A L L  A  K  E  U  P  C  A  L  L  
Kirk. Shut the fuck up.
Sideline interference 
Sideline interference on Georgia 
Sideline infraction 
Sideline interference 
YAH
Benched. His first half was atrocious.
GEORGIA PLS
Lol this defense is dogshit vs the pass, our offense needs to score.
Sideline interference
"Sideline interference" to be enforced on the kickoff 
Then ya gotta let it staaaaaand as caaaaalled
Uninvited
Nope. Just this officiating is absurdly one sided 
Huge call with it standing. Man that would been rough if it came back.
From just reading these threads and not actually watching the game (fuck the ESPN stream), you people are crazy.I feel like I'm gonna get a heart attack by just reading people's reactions
What was the sideline interference??
WHAT A ROLLERCOASTER
[Head of NCAA officiating spotted on the sideline](http://www.media3.hw-static.com/wp-content/uploads/2439783.jpg)
time to become a shootout
that was pretty clearly on the line right?!
Sideline infraction
Sideline interference. 
Sideline interference by Georgia. 
Some sideline penalty
Stupid
Figured that out against OU myself.
HAHAHAHI fucking love Dragon Ball Z and Football 
Its too close to call.
I expected the refs to overturn and give the td to Bama on that call
Aren''t you supposed to get a warning first?
Man, they really want that to be overturned.
Kept expecting the call to be overturned honestly
Wow, what was on the replay?
THE REFS ARE GARBAGE BOTH WAYS YIPEE
Sideline interference
Sideline interference. 15 yd. penalty enforced at kickoff.
Sideline 
They never said 
I thought so too
I can only apologize so much. I have degrees from both.
This is a really tough one. Probably made the right decision. 
That was awesome. Thought refs would fuck that up.
Lol clearly out of bounds.  What was that again about Bama rigging?!  
That's as close as you can get without being out. Wow.
The flag for the interference came in during the play, so how would that count the TD? What's to prevent a coach from tripping a DB then?Edit: oh it was a ref
SUCK ON THAT REFS
Sideline interference on Georgia
Sideline interference
"Sideline interference"AKA $$$$$$$$$
Sideline interference. 
Sideline interference, deadball foul so the TD stands. 15 yard penalty on Georgia for the kickoff, though.
Sideline interference
Sideline warnings are typical on long big plays. A player probably got in the way of an official trying to get down field.Correctly doesn't affect the play, but after the play. It is a live ball treated as a dead ball.
People asking why they only reviewing Georgia plays? Cause Alabama hasn''t had close plays tip toeing the sideline! How hard is it to figure out lol
Wow the refs had a chance to fuck over Georgia and didn't take it. I'm shocked.
HOLY SHIT refs called something in Georgiaa favor
 This ought to stand really. 
Can someone explain the penalty? So you can run on the field and interfere with the play and the end result of the play will stand?
What was the penalty?E: I know the call, I want to see the evidence
Oh wait, I think his heel's out by a millimeter... ah, apparently not. Ok.
I honestly don't think this is rigged in any way after that. Great pass
Sideline interference. Enforced on kickoff
Sideline interference. Didn't call back the TD thankfully.
Wow they kept the call. Trying to keep their jobs I guess
Oob 
Sideline interference.
Sideline interference
sideline interference on the non play side of the ball wtf
Sideline interference on GA.
Sideline interference.  idk what it really was either. 
I like them leaving it alone. Too close to call. 
Yeah, the refs should just ignore the rules and skip reviewing any play that goes Georgia's way. 
Thank goodness it stands. If they called that back, that would have been pretty dumb.
Stands vs confirmed is the most meaningless distinction in football. 
Fromm rips off his helmet and reveals it's MATT STAFFORD
That''d be some shit if overturned
Good call 
FUCK BAMA!!!
Dead ball sideline interference
Size Line Defference
Sideline interference on Georgia 
sideline interference 15 yards after the kick.
Update pls 
Happy Cake Day!!
Oh boo-hoo
They were gonna kiss why did they stop
That''s a shitty straight line. Whoever painted that boundary line was tweaking or something 
That''s an uneven paint job
No way you can overturn that
LONGEST PLAY ALLOWED BY BAMA DEFENSE ALL. SEASON. LONG.
HE'S IN
Good job by the refs there
Deadball sideline interference
Sideline interference
Sideline interfere against Georgia. Assessed at the kickoff. 
Sideline interference after the TD
yeah I'm stoked I was falling asleep during that first half
Calls are mostly good, but damn these refs are really selective on what they want to call
Good call
Way to show the worst possible angle
Ok. That was out of bounds
UGA finally gets a break
Side line interference.
Sideline interference, touchdown was good
Sideline interference.
Sideline interference on Georgia if I heard correctly
Sideline interference - 15 yards enforced on the kickoff
There's no way you could call that out... way too close.  
These refs suck
NFL that's ruled out even though it isn't conclusive. Good on the refs for honoring the  spirit of the review rules.
[deleted]
at this point I''m assuming this is karma hitting Alabama hard for trying to elect a pedofile.
Sideline interference
You have to be a blood relative to do that. 
Kirk Herbstreit, is that you?
Oh, right! What am i thinking?
Tony brown giveth, and Tony brown taketh away. 
Wait is this that officiating crew with the guy who got fired from the B1G for being so bad and which also had two verified OSU fans reffing The Game last year?
Where is everyone saying its rigged now?
Surprised the refs didn't have to pull out an index card for that one
Yet another third and long Bama gave up. That's where the game has been lost.
Fuck espn I''m finding an alternate stream 
He's in. Fuck the nonsense, let them play. That touchdown stands. 
Thank god
NFL should follow suit. No conclusive evidence that he stepped out
Damn I think he''s out of bounds
Probably should have been out.
Sideline interference, enforced on kickoff
Side line interference on Kirby i think
Sideline interference but TD stands
Sideline infraction on Georgia.  15 yards enforced on the kickoff.
Sideline interference 
“Sideline interference” just means Saban threw another $100 bill. 
I dunno, could they fit a folded piece of paper between his foot and the sideline? 
Holy hamhocks they did not reserve the call.  We can put away our pitchforks.  --------E
Sideline warning on Georgia.  Touchdown counts.
Sideline interference
Sideline interference. 
None
I'd fear for the refs safety if they overturned that TD
What the fuck is this game 
Salty commentator when call goes against bama???
Hi moooommm
Stands as called!  Thank you sweet 8 pound 6 ounce baby Jesus!
This shit is a joke, reviewing all of Georgia's plays just hoping to overturn them to give Bama a chance. So fucking transparent lol
Sideline interference. Enforced after the kickoff
Bama fans are going to bitch about that one forever 
Dear God my heart 
What was the sideline interference? Did they not get it on video?
D I L L YILLY
"Uhh.. There's one more flag on the play! There was.. uh.. holding! Yeah! Holding! Georgia loses!"
Kirby's expression change after he realized that the play would still stand after the penalty was pure gold.
That's a short fuckin review for that close of a call.
Can't overturn that, no way that there was irrefutable evidence. 
idk if it's the wrong call. fuck you bama
Sideline infraction from Georgia, 15 yards enforced on the kickoff
No sorry
Refs making the game look more balanced lmao
In/outIn/outIn/out
Good call
lmao refs digging to overturn this shit.
Sideline intereference on GA
Sideline interference. 15yards assessed on kickoff
We don't get much NY here except for Ommegang. Was sad to have to miss out on stopping there on my way to Cooperstown a couple summers ago!
Had they said he was out of bounds initially then it would have been irreversible too. Good call there. 
Refs huddle, can't figure out a penalty against UGa, we can do a sideline infraction.
Can we get that speed of reviews in the NFL?
why aren't they going for two
Now we're cookin!
Sagan should make Kirby run laps for that interference call.
Sideline infraction on Georgia, enforced as a dead ball foul.
sideline interference enforced on kickoff
The story of this game so far Bama not being able to get off the field on 3rd Down.
Fromm did it 
coaches on the field
That was literally a vertical line up his shoe, insane
SO FUCKING CLOSE
rEfS wIlL cAlL aNyThInG tO hElP bAmA
Good call standing but man I do think some white was touching the heel 
I dont think that is out of bounds
Sideline interference. Lord knows.
Sideline interference on Georgia. 15 yards on the kickoff
sideline interference, only causes yards lost on the kick off, touchdown stands
Sideline interference, Georgia
Sideline interference. Outside of the field of play, so it's gonna be enforced on the kickoff
Kirby running on field, sideline interference. 15 yards on the kickoff. 
Sideline interference. Enforced on the kickoff. 
They barked like dogs, maybe.
Within 2 minuts they already have the UGA call hooked up on SEC Network.
With how the reffing has been tilted towards Bama, I'm surprised that stood
Fucking announcers cant make it anymore clear that theyre for Alabama
The Rose Bowl was so good because the refs weren''t apart of it
Sideline interference, were and how?
What happens if you''re touching a guy who''s OB?
Shut up, Cuntstreit. 
What was the penalty?
Freshman QB duel?  I'd be happy to see a defensive first half into a second half shootout. 
can't overturn that
Yeah, I thought they were about to fuck you on the review
He was not out
goodness PIXELS
That crooked-ass line lol
Kirby with his Bama shades on saw he was out of bounds. 
THESE OFFICALS ARE PLAYING WITH MY GEORGIA HEART
fuck that. he stayed in bounds
"The refs are throwing the game" lol. They just gave you a touchdown.
He was out 
93 yard touch down, fucking amazing!
Sideline interference. Dead call foul. 15 yards on the kickoff.
Bent grass.
Someone jerking it to that TD catch
Fastest review I''ve ever seen. Thanks for that refs. 
Holy fuck, what a beautiful ball. Fromm is going to be a fucking beast.
Let's see how magical Tua is
Frohm being like fuck you bro. Watch this
#STANDS, I'LL TAKE IT
Sideline interference. Will be enforced on the kickoff. Now they''re reviewing the TD call
Works both ways though right? If they have to respect the pass, opens running backs for bigger plays. 
What a fucking dime. 
Commentator is blind. "Definitely out" lmao
That sounds like a terrible idea ... could take away from watching the coaches ...
I knew they wouldn't overturn it. Too close. What a throw though. Georgia and strong armed tossers, the dynamic-est dueo
ITS A GAME OF INCHES!
Sideline interference on the Dawgs
Sideline interference.
Sideline interference on Kirby Smart. Enforced on the kickoff. 
To be fair Hurts is 12-1 as a starter. But I definitely get what you are saying. Alabama''s schedule wasn''t too tough on Hurts so in a different scenario he may have been benched at some point.
Are players allowed to wear turf colored cleats? 
Fromm is such a beast.
Stands as MOTHER FUCKING CALLED. *TAKE THIS GAME FROM US REFS,* ***I DARE YOU***
Here we fucking go boys! Shootout time! 
Makes up for the Alabama zombie scoring drive that never should have been allowed to happen because of terrible calls."Ball don't lie" - Rasheed Wallace
Coaches got too excited and ran on the field.
Crazy
UCF is pitching a shutout right now
You're all right, everyone. The refs are clearly biased towards Bama. A bunch of Big 10 refs really like Alabama.
TEACH ME YOUR TIGHTROPE DRILLS DAWGS
Why is tua playing? Change of pace? Injury?
Hes out by a micrometer but you cant take that back
Looks out to me but I think it standing is a good make up call.
BRB deleting tweets about paid off refs 
He was out...
Eh. 
Sideline interference on Georgia, dead ball penalty so the touchdown counts.
Can''t confirm that he wasn''t out of bounds but I think he was. “Alabama announcers”
Wild game
He was so obviously out wtf
I think you're looking for space jam
Probably true
nice and classy sir I like it
Don't say that... It's too soon... Saban sacrificed too many goats...
 We have a lot of reasons to. 
Not on Alabama. They are just that good. 
"after review, the refs in the booth wouldn't let us take this TD back. Play stands."
They're gonna mark him out. Can't see any daylight between his shoe and the white. 
Surprised the refs didn''t pull out the ole index cards 
Fuck off Herbstreit
Sideline interference
Sideline interference - find yourself a new bar, my dude!
That's way too close to take away.  Or the refs have already had their families threatened by everyone in Georgia and decided not to risk it.
That ref took like 10 seconds to review that shit wtf?  
No way this can be overturned. 
I''m just excited to see Bama employ more three wide sets!!!
Is there anything in the official rule book that distinguishes a "stands" call from a "confirmed" call?
What do you mean?
tbf if we weren't convinced he's a football genius already we might be setting the bar a littttttle bit too high haha
[Jake Fromm bombs one to Mecole Hardman for an 80-yard TD](https://www.clippituser.tv/c/edbwgr)
They knew they fucked up bad with those other two calls, so they basically said “ehh, it''s close enough to give it to the dawgs” on that review 
LETS GO
That really just needs to stand.

Sideline interference 
Sideline interference by Georgia. Enforced on the kickoff 
Pretty sure they would have overturned that TD if that was the case
Good call, wasn''t definitive.
Not enough evidence, has to stand as called. 
Not conclusive enough to overturn but that was damn close.
don't get too comfortable guys, they are gonna try something again next drive. Here comes alabamas free touchdown 
If they out that, UGA riots. 
“Sideline interference”
I'm surrounded by Georgia fans... Help
ooh boy these refs got me on a rollercoaster 
They know 
Same , have no idea what that signal is
Sideline interference
Thicc
That was the prettiest throw I've ever seen
Hardman would''ve looked nice in a buckeye uniform :( great to see he''s killing it at Georgia 
Herbie is such a homer. He wasn''t out of bounds. 
Hahahaha that''s so fucking close 
Can they please put Hurts back in I feel bad. 
Alabama got fleeced
He was out. Now maybe everyone can shut up about favoritism.
Yes we are
http://www.espn.com/watch/_/id/3267580/sounds-of-the-game-2018-college-football-playoff-national-championshipSounds of the game man!
\>Refs are in it for Bama.\>Georgia guy is out of bounds on review.\> Georgia TD stands.\>tfw
Booth calls down like fuck off we got UGA
I'm not sure how they did on that drive but alright
Oh shit
Great call, there just was not enough to overturn it
AYYEEE #GO DAWGS
If someone actually makes contact with the official, it''s an automatic penalty. Learned that earlier this year when it was called on Clemson. 
Original comment
idiot
What a fucking bomb 
**Fromm has found daway**
He looked out to me, and I fucking hate Bama.
The refs' consultation with the review official went as follows: "Look, if you don't let this stand, I'll be gutted before the night is over. Just let them have this."
yeah, no way that could be overturned
Now all can stfu on bama refs. 
YouTube tv free trial
You are our only hope
Montana Young
that's as close as it can possibly get.
Looked possibly OOB but I can't bitch about the calls after the earlier botches in our favor.
refs have redeemed a small amount of credibility
what an answer
Pleasant surprise
what? IF you touch a player who is out of bounds? Seriously they are wanting to review that? Find me that rule. 
That's alright, just gotta get out there and answer back.
Pretty sure he was out but whatever.fuck Bama
Sideline interference. 15 yards enforced on the kick.
I'm glad people are seeing the shit we have to put up with in the big 10 (referring to refs)
Jeez, college refs reviewing plays are more competent than the NFL review system
Way to capitalize dawgs
Looks like if he planted his foot ~2 feet behind him that squiggly ass sideline would've been 100% in bounds.
I''m so confused. How can a sideline interference be a dead ball foul? You can''t interfere unless the play is live and if you interfere it should affect the play and therefore be enforced during the play, not after. 
Welp looks like they're blind on both ends 
Goddamn, Fromm has ice water in his veins.
The fuck Bama train is getting strong..... Choo Choo
What a pretty throw and catch.
Looked pretty out to me, but I can't complain after the false start and facemask..
SEC teams always get the good calls /s
What was that penalty for? 
Sideline interference 
Or the refs
2 m s no h
That call went for Georgia...
Because he's a true freshman
Hoooly FUCK
Dilly dilly
Why is sideline interference being enforced? Teams usually get one warning 
Drink everytime they say - "but is it enough to overturn it"
Well, I forgive the face mask. 
Refs are like "we love Bama but damn we can't really afford to start the Second Civil War, TD Georgia I guess"
Stand is the right call
Tbh I think he was out and the TD should have been overturned
Hmm... I think I would've sided with the refs if they overturned that. I think that's riiiiiiight on the boundary of what constitutes clear evidence.
HE WAS OUT 
I'm guessing play stands. Not enough to turn over the play.
The radio im listening to is ahead of the tv so i heard the 80 yard touchdown and was confused why all the comments were "georgia is blowing this"
If he relaxed even a little bit he was out. Damn that was close. Good job dude
“Too close to overturn.”“No green visable.”“ALL THESE MISSED CALLS ON BAMA PAWLLL.”goddammit.
Please.  
It''s Alabama thoI stand corrected 
Nah, that would be way too easy to abuse
Unbiased... thats out. 
These reviews are getting out of hand
Think that's one of those calls that majorly depends on the initial call. Whichever way they called it, not enough to overturn.
That would have been some NHL tip of the blade off sides review challenge bullshit if that was called back.
Finally the refs made a good call.
"Sideline interference" = Alabama didn't score and we don't like that. 
Who talkin shit on Fromm?? 
In-bounds
[removed]
He was in
I just can't wait until we have AI refs. Sports will be so much better without humans making judgment calls like those. 
And they can't review offsides or missed face masks 
Nah, too close to call
If you step on the field during play, regardless of what you do, it is a penalty. 
The sideline is jaggy
Did they ever show the replay of the penalty?
LOL NOT INDISPUTABLE. IT WAS THE RIGHT CALL. ANYTHING ELSE IS WONR
Gotta get back to the commercials
Too soon
There has to be an illusion of fairness 
This is why I hate replay. I'm glad that play stood and they didn't try to over analyze the play. He is neither clearly in nor out. It is not a obviously incorrect call on the field. Look at it, and move on. 
No replay on the sideline interference? Wtf
That''s a make up for the blown punt call, and I''m glad they had the td stand
Gorgeous throw
is this a joke?
make up call
> Longest play against Alabama all season
Easily the greatest Fromm Bomb yet
Normally because players are getting too close to the field. They have to stay behind the line that''s three yards off of the field
AS IT SHOULD BE
Dawgs
This is some of the worst commentating I've heard
uhhh...that was definitive
Alright Georgia show em they can't beat you without outside help.
why would they...?
Might want to keep him in the game.
Damn if they called that back that would be Ticky tack as fuck
Breaking new mass floods in Alabama
how? He was in bounds.
Bama fans = Pats fans 
Damn, these refs trying so hard to give it to bama
What is college football?
Dear God please
That throw was gorgeous. Right in the hands.
Kirk can kiss my ass 
I'm happy that of all people that happened to Tony Brown
Is he not OOB for touching the OOB guy?
Fromm is a stud. That was a dime!
Looks like we might have a shootout on our hands y'all
Herbstreit riding Bama's dick so hard still
better than the thicc six
put on the coaches film room. it's 100x better
[[Oklahoma vs. Oklahoma State]]
Nah. There was a single grass blade between his foot and the sideline
Nothing like a good 90° sideline foot to get a man hard.
Holy shit that was a fast review.
I'd be cool with a freshman QB show of a ton of yards
I was thinking the same thing.
Pretty sure a coach/player on UGA impeded the ref from running down the sideline to follow the catch 
[man this game is so good](https://imgur.com/gallery/JExHX)
Cmon Tua, we need a dumb rookie pick
OMG if Fromm gets MVP of the National Championship Game
perfect pass
Yea, he looked out in that close up replay.
Wasn't clear, either way both teams would be mad. Big ten refs are best in the biz
Alabama has been absolutely  miserable on third and long.It should be really worrying for the fans and team.
If that guy was a size 12 instead of 11 bro
FUCK YEA. GO DAWGS
let it stand
I'm gonna guess some players ran onto the before the play was over.
I was just wondering that actually
I can't believe Fromm completed that. What a fucking throw by a freshman. Georgia is gonna have another #1 pick QB
The refs obviously didn't want to get murdered on their way out of Atlanta. 
Good call. Replay is to prevent the egregious error, not be pedantic. 
No fucking *way* you can overturn that    
That's ball game
That''s a TD
Fuck yah
He was pretty obviously out, that's kinda surprising. Especially seeing as the narrative is all about the FIX IS IN DAE BAMA PAYING DUR REFSStop being weenies. If they wanted Bama to win, they had plenty of cause to rule him out and enforce the penalty from that spot.
They didn't show any replay for it.
Rogaine, care to name anything else Hurts needs to put on his grocery list?
That throw was so good, god damn 
As a Big XII fan, WTF is with these 30 second reviews? I thought there was a 5 min minimum...
#UCF is fucking garbage
you mean like when they called out the refs on both of those missed calls on bama earlier in the quarter
Usually if it''s too close they''ll stick with the original call on the field.
When is the leaky butthole going to affect this game
Yeah. While simultaneously ignoring the countless times it goes their way. 
Ok fair enough thats a weird situation for the rivalry
First half SEC.Second half Big 12
Can we see etter the actual call was?
Surprised the refs didn''t overturn that one cause they haven''t done any other favors for UGA
Not even enough time for a commercial.
[[Oklahoma vs. Oklahoma State]]
We are about to see a freshman quarterback and freshman left tackle play football for the Alabama offense! Freshmen! Would you believe it?
I'm still shocked that Saban benched Hurts on this game. 
Oh shit. Surprising stuff refs. Now I can't wait to see how weird the calls are the rest of the way. 
fuck, so excited, let's go Dawgs we ain't scared of them
BLATANT HOLDING 
So freaking close but I think they made the right call by sticking with what was called on the field.  
Dilly dilly!
Lmao
Jesus that guy is fucking fast.
Yea that was about as close a call as it gets, and it was called inbounds on the field and they are shocked it wasn't reversed. I have no dog in the fight but that was weird. 
Hey The refs were a main reason you guys got a touchdown in the first place. It's only fair you give Georgia a call their way 
These freshman QBs have ice in their veins
93 yards btwHardcore ironman btw
Didn''t interfere with the score.
Lemme just say, what a curvy ass sideline. Turf guys, be better. 2018, new year new you 
Fromm with the daddy dick pass 
I'm just glad we have a game now! 
Well there are four calls Georgia can use to counter.
It could be Tua late. He's bound to throw a at least one pick this half. It's just fact for qbs in their first game.
Yeah you can't overturn that. There might not be green between, but that doesn't necessarily mean he is out. 
Some days I can't walk in a straight path to my closet. These guys run ridiculously fast along the line without stepping out. 
"WWHHOooaaAaAaAAa NOW, STANDS not CONFIRMED!" - Announcers...so?
For all the people freaking-out about this. The deadball nature of this call means that someone on the UGA sideline was running-out in celebration or doing something else way-out-of-the-way of the play after he was breaking-free.It was not a cheating play in any way.
Did y'all forget about commercials? Heeeerrreee weeeeeeeeeeee goooooooooo
DAE want unbiased PACderp10 refs?
First one worked out fine for us. 
[deleted]
I don't even mean that it's overplayed I just hate the ending "blimp worthy" line enough to think it ruins the whole thing. And I'm also new here haha. Made my first comment here during halftime
Can someone explain the sideline interference?
#THEM DAWGS IS HELL 
I'm getting the DVD no matter what happens. 
was going to laugh my ass off if they got him on that
Are you listening to the same guys I am? They've been pretty even handed and they've called out the refs for missed calls that went Bama's way.
Why do you say such things 
I mean do you really need to watch the same replay 50 times to tell? One or two looks and you can either decide it stands or is overturned
Hell of a throw!
Another huge third down play from UGA. Great throw by Fromm, even more impressive after what this defense did to Clemson last week.
Will these announcers please get off the Bama dick? Oh my god.
Clearly a makeup call.
(It was decided before they called the review)
who came close to actually affecting the outcome of that play from the sideline?
One of my bama fan friends literally made a instagram group chat prayer group at halftime. There are currently 15 bama fans in there praying for the W
So what was the sideline interference?
Puts torch and pitchfork away....For now...
ur mum
Something I''d never thought I''d here 
Wtf was the penalty for though?
Kirk stop sucking bama's dick
What happened with that flag??
As is tradition. 
Change of pace. They needed a passing threat. 
Lol Spam Jam sounds terrible
Hopefully they show that sideline interference penalty. That's 15 yards of field position on this upcoming drive. Not exactly inconsequential.
Can tua speak English?
he deserves a millimeter of grace for that tackle shedding lol
You don't know what "clearly" means do you?
So what the fuck was the penalty for
HERBSTRIET SHUT YOUR ASS UP BRO
He can''t pass!
trying pretty hard to, yeah.
Dilly dilly!
Eligibility should be decided by regular season not retroactively by winning a game in the playoffs. Alabama was handed a spot when other teams played to earn a spot. 
Let's Go Bama. I don't wanna listen to yall and Georgia every season
No really. They gave you the touchdown
looked oob to me too but that is never going to get turned over
Georgia fans: "nvm, refs are amazzzzin"
People laughed when I said it early on. But it's obvious now Baker Mayfield would have fucked up this Bama D.  Grabbed his crotch and made it his bitch.
What a response from Georgia. 
They couldn't overturn it
JAKE FROMM STATE FARM
When replay works.  Close call.  Only takes a minute.  Nothing conclusive.  Call stands
I don't think those refs would be making it out of the state if they took that one away lol
People in here complaining about the announcers as if that review couldn't have gone either way
Refs had to give that to Georgia after that blocked punt bullshit.
close this thang out boys, let's fucking go!
Not enough there to overturn it but whatevaaaaaaa
Where tf was the sideline interference?
Why? Kid can''t throw the ball for shit 
They just can't handle the mass audience for big games... other feeds like command center or sky cam work a lot better tho cause less people watching.
What did you expect?
Your flair is very confusing
Nobody interfered with the play. They got in the way of one of the trailing officials. Also - nobody ran on the field. It was a sideline interference with an official. 
Lmao the armchair refs 
I can''t see where anything egregious happened on the sideline. Oh well. 
No
After about 5 plays of dominating that offense they let up an 80 yard TD? Daaamn
Right call
What the hell were the refs even calling there? There wasn''t a coach in the way 
That throw tho!
50 yard line, on Kirby 
I can't imagine how pleasant you'd be if you were losing. 
Screw you Herbstreit
That''s why you don''t wear white shoes 
Anyone know if Megatron's Butthole is still leaking fluid?
He stepped out? 
Sideline infraction on UGA ... enforced on the kickoff.
agreed
That was a perfect ball from Jake.
Didn't see that going GA's way tbh
App is so bad 
lol I don't even watch CFB and it's pretty obvious they've called and haven't called stuff in favor of Alabama of Georgia 
Cfbstreams subreddit. But also wiz1 dot net
I cannot fucking believe they would call a sideline infraction on an 80 yard TD in the goddamn national championship. 
What was the sideline interference?
since our Ark game, I am 100% convinced that refs do makeup calls
i didnt see any penalty on the sideline? 
Plz don''t remind me
I wish they would elaborate on what exactly happened
Where's the flag?? I saw zero interference
Where was that sideline interference?
Jake Fromm State Farm is smacking that ass
He's trying to win
Eh. Reviews should be short. Either there is conclusive evidence and call is overturned or its close and call stands as called. 
You're saying that's clearly out of bounds?
6 million reviews aside, that was a really well throw ball.
Both of these coaches have balls of meteorite to rely so heavily on talented freshman QBs.  As a fan of a team who does the opposite to our frequent detriment, I am jealous.
Hold up. We''re getting word that review is under further review
Herbstreet is high. You cant Conclusively say that's outta bounds..
I wonder if these refs are scared to make some calls in Bamas favor just for fear of the bcklash
Actually no one has said a bad thing about him all day. Not one thing. 
The ball was well past the spot where the coach was. If the coach actually interfered with the play it would be a different call 
What was the sideline interference? Never seen that called
Real talk though how did he not make that tackle lol
Bama killed on 3rd down all game. 
Any body got an angle of what the penalty was?
rEfS cOnFiRmEd ThRoWiNg iT fOr BaMa
Anyone else just see herbstreit draw a sperm with the yellow pen? 
We still have a chance, Bama bros.
Where the fuck was the interference that they called?
Georgia is scary and they are ahead of time
Making up for the previous 5 missed calls on Y'ALL
Now we have 2 Bamas FUCK
I took the over bet. I need more big 12. 
Yeah, wtf was it? 
OHAH! HA HA
Lol where is the interference on the sideline, there was nothing there..
To be fair the face mask was wayyyyy more clear cut. 
Are you serious? He was 100% on the line. They had plenty of cause to call that back. Stop being a victim.
Glad the refs put value in the flow of the game, its refreshing to see in football
If Georgia is this good now, what the fuck are they going to be once these insane recruiting classes start piling in? 
I am most proud of the way these kids don''t give up. My god Kirby you''ve got them choppin wood
Why is a penalty that happens during the play treated as dead ball?
hyped hyped hyped!!!!!!!
look into the eyes of Fromm
Probably only interfered with an official, not one of the players.
But I'm saying why doesn't the play come back? Why is it assessed on the kickoff?
I want off the SECs wild ride
By god that''s Matt Stafford''s music!
It was! My mom is downstate visiting a family-friend until tomorrow so my dad and I have had a rare long Guys weekend and we''ve done all the classics, ribs, steaks etc and thought we''d do something new for the last night. It was a lot of fun and tasted great. I''m 29 and only home for few weeks in between jobs so it was a fun one that I''ll remember for a while. What''d you have?
Still didn''t see any “sideline” interference 
Still wanna see the sideline infraction 
Well that was close.
Far too early in the game to leave points on the table
Pretty clear there wasn''t anywhere near enough to overturn it. 
Well based on this season so far, with this game added on... This should have been UCF vs. Georgia for the Natty
Georgia's ref debt is being paid back.
Fromm has a fucking cannon. 
Amid all the Tua hype, Fromm just threw an absurd third-and-11 longball with all the momentum against him.
I LIKE FROMM
Make up call for missing the blocked punt.
come on you dawgs!
Like it actually zoomed in showing that his heel was on the line.Fuck Bama but I would be angry if it went against me.
Guys I'd like to sincerely apologize for ever doubting Jake Fromm.. this kid can straight ball, that was a D I M E
[deleted]
Dude got the first td
All radio signals are ahead of television.
You were out
Wow thank goodness they didn''t reverse that. Nice answer by Georgia.
Alabama couldn't beat a cold 
Bama is shaming the 4th seed placement. 
Didn't pay the refs well enough, I see.
Sideline interference by Georgia.
Having watched 7 replays, where the hell is the sideline interference?
Fuck Fuck Fuck
I hope they don't pull an Atlanta Falcons 2016 Superbowl on us.
Get cable
itd be the civil civl war lmao
pace and getting the ball out quickly
Sideline infraction doesn''t mean interferes with the play. It was probably behind the line of scrimmage or after the play. 
DID YOU SEE THE MUSTACHE ON THAT GUY ON THE SIDELINE
Show the sideline interference! At this point you have to prove it to me, refs.
this game wont end till 2am jesus christ
On every one of those looks, did anyone see any sort of sideline interference? 
Did they show the sideline interference?
Unbelievable. Great throw and great catch!
How was his foot not out?
Accurate
According to Gus Johnson, Hardman has "runnin from the cops speed"
where the hell was the sideline interference? no one is close to the sidelines in any replays
think of the amount of butthole clench it took him to stay in bounds
A perfect fucking pass. Incredible 
Tony Brown is a liability.
Never. These refs have me on edge vk
I don''t think it works like that
LOL THE FUCKING SIDELINE FOUL WAS 50 YARDS BEHIND THE PLAY
Wtf was the sideline interference for? I didn't see anything in the replays 
Y'all really gonna bitch about them reviewing a touchdown? Come on now.
Penalty on georgia for not being alabama.
ACC refs are best
Well, the good news for Georgia is there is no way this'll become a 28-3 score.
G A M E O F I N C H E SAME  OFINCHES
Did he throw that flag when he ran himself off the white?
Out of bounds
These are all words that I am saying. Because I''m Herbstreit. 
Dilly dilly
Announcers gotta eat too bruh
Probably the ref was way out of the play and while running, the referendum ran into him.I think the rule makes sense unless it's coach interfering with the players. 
Indignant Bama fans. This is new.
That's the wrong call, it's pretty clear he's on the white.
I hate hate hate the concept of making up a blown call.Officials don't do that.It is simply making a good call and a good stands (not confirmed or overturned) replay.
I had the same question, but it would appear nothing at all.
Didn''t realize jalen''s passing was that bad?
Brings me back to Les Miles not benching Jefferson.
Um...did I miss a play or something? Are you in the future 
>Some team scores"That team will now win this game" ~ r/cfb 
*Get your upvotes here! We have "Fuck Bama" and "fuck the refs!" comments half price! Guaranteed upvotes!*
Bama actually fucked
Sideline interference 
sideline interference 
thought it was an overthrow, but the WR had the wheels to get there
Momentum
make it a 14 point game instead of 13. bama gets a short field this time, you don't score and bama scores another td they take a one point lead instead of possibly tying the game.
People here are turning against the tide. 
Get rekt Bama
Contact must've been made. Or just a ref in a bad mood
80 fucking yards!!!! Go Dawgs!!!!
Yeah. That would have been bullshit if they called that out of bounds. Too close.But I feel your pain, Bama fans. If I were you I would be screaming too. 
Wow the SEC always gets the good calls
Incredible throw and run after catch
great special teams tackle
**HOT TAKE ALERT**HERBSTREIT LOVES BIG THICK DB''S
Can't take that touchdown away refs! GO DAWGS!
Got damn Blankenship!
HOLY FUCK WHAT A KICK
Wait
What was the sideline interference all about?
Looking at the sideline who the hell was in the way for the penalty?!?!
[I've only seen this raw strength once before](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nUJkVIX0jI)
Don''t talk about the national champions that way.
Holy shit that moustache 
Why not go for 2?
Story of a defensive struggle. Both teams suddenly realize they can score and it is just bombs away.
Wait, I thought the refs were going to give everything to Bama because corruption?
Too close to overturn. If he was called out on the field it would have stood as well 
There's some charm to the human element, but I feel like there's legitimate behind the scenes shenanigans that do have a biased impact on the outcomes of the rulings.
LETS GO DAWGS
Did anyone else see the guy with the pirate mustache on the Georgia sideline? 
AJ GREEN
Nice tackle Bama blocker.
And he still only got to the 23...
Kirby running on to the field like a mad man
Jalen Hurts finna lead UCF out the tunnel as their new starting RB after the trophy presentation, like “It''s not over yet bitch!”Edited because UCF fans were insulted by the original version.
Little bias by the commentators, eh?
Unbiased, not enough to reverse I think
Lol you cant reverse that call
Thats the right call. Impossible to confirm without microscope
What was the sideline interference?
***Updated Mathematical Score Prediction***Georgia 31.4685314685 - 10.4545454545 Alabama
Damn, he got tackled by his own man.
Kickoffs are stupid and anticlimactic
Stop Bama here and you can think about running out the clock
Did anyone see that asshole with the handlebar mustache on Georgia''s sideline?
Oh please. Be thankful.
49 states are rooting for you. 
*puts down pitchfork*
So, half-yard penalty.
Sideline warning. Our team freaked out and got to close to or on the field 
I''m still waiting on my ambulance for doing all the “True Freshman Quarterback” shots
I feel like we're just one more all SEC championship away from just that. 
Agree
HATE FEEDS THE DAWGDAWG BITES HARDER WHEN BIT
I just wanna see Kirby breaking free of the guy holding him back
Sideline interference
Tua starts next year. Guaranteed.
Coaches saying sideline warning was harsh.
There''s no indisputable video evidence to overturn the call on the field. He wasn''t definitively in or out. 
Holy shit rip your inbox lmao
Sideline infraction on Georgia.
Lol?
I would appreciate seeing a replay of where the sideline interference penalty was.
What was the penalty I still don''t get it???
congrats on your future NFL career Jake
I kinda like Bama winning because its fun for everyone to get so mad and hate them.But this is also real cool.
That looked pretty definitive to me
Did anyone see what the sideline interference was?  
Jesus Christ.  WatchESPN is always laggy and trashy.   Every other service works flawlessly.
Jake Fromm looks like he's 27 tbh
First Kendrick was lip syncing and then the game is rigged. Y''all are ridiculous. 
Anyone explain that penalty?
I love it so much when they do game analysis like this. 
It's hilarious to me how much Clemson fans seem to care that Alabama loses. They still skullfucked you, get the fuck over it.
Right? All the easy reviews that weren't needed took 5 mins a piece. Here, a crucial call needs to be made and they decide after 1 viewing wtf?
Sideline interference enforced on the kickoff
Your player was out of bounds, and it wasn't even really hard to overturn. Yet they just GAVE Georgia a touchdown... and you're complaining? Jesus.
I think they said..m uh oh way too close, fuck it.
No that's only if the defender is trying to recover a fumble
ESPN not going to show a replay of the "sideline interference"
Uhhh. Does espn realize they forgot the commercials?
To the 5!!! GOGGLES!! 
>be me>wake up>Bama promptly drives down the field for their first score/r/CFB do I go back to sleep?
Sideline interference but they never showers what it was
Usually somebody on the sidelines bumping or otherwise altering the course of somebody in play. 
How? There is literally zero green between his foot and the line, thus is out of bounds. 
Dropping' the F-bomb
I know. Trust me, it was an ethical conundrum.
Sooo I wanna see that sideline interference 
We need the Big-10 championship turf dude
What was the sideline interference? ESPN never showed it
I didn't see any sideline infraction on that replay?
Tua 75 yarder here
Figuring that no one probably actually has video of itPlus, did I miss an earlier warning?  I thought they always give one.  Maybe not
50 yard line against Kirby I believe 
4 bs calls for bama in a row is too much
Go Dawgs! Go Dawgs!
Scale of 1-10 how bad is Saban missing Kiffin?
He was out of bounds. But they owed a call to Georgia
With all the replays, I have yet to see any sideline interference. 
Holy shit that kick
Then explain to me why I was hearing his verses when the microphone was away from his face and his mouth was closed. And don't say it was a backup track because I know what that fucking is and it wasn't it.Edit: or just downvote and don't offer an explanation because there isn't one.
It's amazing the refs are staying out of this game, it's rather refreshing 
Don''t worry guys. WatchESPN app still sucks and I just missed the entire 80 yard TD play. 
"I'm going to run this shit right into the pile and stop instantly. Let's fucking go."
Can anyone explain why the non-midfield angles are so atrocious? Did they not leave an area for cameras when building the stadium?
All 22 cam is a hidden treasure
GREAT coverage there... forget the penalty, that's essentially a touchback
Fromm dolpins need u
If they can overrule catches with a quarter inch of wiggle upon contact with the ground, that can be called back.
Finally something strong enough to reverse the trend. 
Like they haven't had an hour+ of ads to do it during.
I for one welcome our new dawg overlords of CFB.
anyone else a little shocked that the UGA band plays a lot of, what could be considered "Union Songs"?Sherman effect?
Huh throwing against Bama works better than running against them, who woulda thunk it
What the hell is the sideline interference call? Also, how can you have a call like that and not call it back? 
What an amazing kicker
I believe the sideline interference call was a Georgia assistant coach impeding the officials ability to run down the sideline.
Jake Fromm gotta be a future first overall pick kids a monster
Is this how it''s like in most SEC games?? Fans just complaining about the refs?
I''m wondering the same damn thing. 
Jesus Hurts Christ that kick and that coverage
Football's mullet: business in the front, party in the back.
Saban is gonna have to sacrifice a few more graduate assistants to lock this up. 
BAMA BROS YOU KNOW THIS IS THE WAY IT HAS TO BE
Jake Fromm can only throw slants
Coach celebrating on the sidelines jumped into the field? Idk. Glasses guy still kicked off to the 5. 
How many holds will Alabama get away with on this drive? TUNE IN TO FIND OUT
Right? Although it might not have been caught on camera clearly.
Didn't look like it to me. Its clear no green blades are between the foot and the sideline but it isn't clear if the foot is depressing any white blades. The white isn't surrounding the heel. 
15 yard penalty and they still start at the touchback line ayyy
So who is this Alabama QB?
I know but I didn't see anything 
Good taste in reaction clips
UPDATE: Corndog has been removed and replaced with the soul of Saban
That was an amazing kick/coverage given the circumstances
Big if true
They would have reversed if so, shut up
The sideline interference had to be on Kirby. The guy on his belt let go!
Refs literally trying everything to keep this close
Refs called one Georgia's way? Bama must have fucked up the routing number on their last wire transfer.
Great kick, great coverage. No net loss for the penalty. 
It appeared to be around the 40 or 50
Seriously...Don''t know where people are getting that idea 
Where he fuck is the sideline interference
Winning formula.
I''m on post in Germany 
Ok boss
DID YOU KNOW JAKE FROMM LED WARNER ROBBINS, GA TO THE LITTLE LEAGUE WORLD SERIES?!?!
Umm...
Because they probably only interferes with the ref
Omg Rodrigo. That could turn out to be a huge kick.
Still have yet to see a replay on the apparent “interference”
The fourth quarter might need to be split into two threads
One minor turnover not many penalties. 
Wtf is UGA actually gonna do it?
Elbert county 5 star croot right there. 
Hurts was playing like shit and Saban made the change. 
Lol yeah he was.
H8 FEEDS THE DAWG
Looks like the difference in this game is the QB talent..  based off more than 1 pass
What is sideline interference? 
Cringe 
So where was the sideline interference? Every replay I saw had everyone well off the field, not even the ref ran into anyone. 
INT coming up on 3rd down
A player or coach ran on the field, it's not allowed.
They tried so hard
Again I'm not arguing that. That's why I said we would have to blow out the second half for me to be satisfied.
Jalen hurns is being a great teamate right now.  Love it
No.
Nothing ever seems to go Alabama's way
Are they selling referee uniforms on the NCAA website? Cause clearly they are the stars we all came to see. 
ESPN describes Tua's TD drive as "electric". Are we watching the same game?!
Shh don''t remind them 
If they called that TD back, Congress would have called for an investigation lol
Poor Jalen :(Wow I'll take things I never thought I'd be saying this season for like a million, Alex
He was out. There you go. It's even. Now shut up about the refs favoring Alabama.
Believable. I know a few crazy Bammers 
Nope they made it up 
flair down :O
WHAT...A...PASS!
Would love to see a replay of where the sideline interference came from but I guess that is asking too much
Good boyes
The score is irrelevant when one team is getting missed calls by the refs. Play the game by the rules. The score could be 0-100 in Georgia''s favor and there still should still be fair calls. 
Got a feeling this will become a shoot out now. I hope it doesn''t, but it will 
Can we stop with "the fix is in" now?
DON'T REMIND THEM
Eh they did us dirty because Kelly was worse than Hurts. We had opportunities a plenty. Great defense but we played into their hands.
Calling a pick six 
I love you all!
I didn't see anything on the replay. Not sure what the refs were on about.
Bama''s freshman reminds me of Vick. This game for jalen hurts is worthy of /r/watchpeoplelosetheirjobs
So could Iowa State beat bama 
I wanna see Kirby Mike Tomlin that shit 
I mean it's only been on 2.5 hours and two thirds through the third...
\#BamaBias
Goggles4MVP
Would you rather have to kiss Fromm twice on the lips or Chubb once on the cheek?
Ok D. Show that you can take on this new kid!
Justin Fields is thinking he should have gone to Flordia 
quiet you!
Must be selling their calls loot crate style like EA.
What was that sideline interference penalty? They didn't explain it and I couldn't see anything on the replays. 
aLaBaMa dEsErVeD iT MoRe tHaN UcF
80-yard TD pass is the longest in ANY BCS or CFP Championship Game.
Tua can only throw slants.
Ya, that's as close as it gets in terms of being out of bounds or not. Letting it stand is the right call IMO
No
No he wasn't. 
That was the least straight line I've ever seen in my life.
lol one drive he doubled Hurts' yardage.  Okay, maybe it wasn't insane by Saban to bench your 25-2 starter...
Sideline interference, dead ball foul, 15 yards on the kickoff
Seriously. I don't care who wins and they are reviewing everything Georgia does and missing obvious calls left and right...
Hurts is the least charismatic quarterback I've seen 
As someone who almost exclusively watches nfl games... this is bliss
You must be new here
"My name is Tua you murdered my starter prepare to die."
Someone gif that Jalen
What was the flag on?
*gettin away from
Hey! He lost! Don't you put that evil on us, Ricky Bobby!
So where was the sideline interference? Couldnt see it on replays
GOGGLES
Alabama paid the refs but Georgia paid more
yes
Huh, looks like the supermoon didn't strengthen the tides as much as everybody thought.
Nah we''ll stick with a QB that can actually hit passes against Auburn. 
They never said
Nope i wanted to see that too. Looked like BS as they were alone
It happened to the ref on the line of scrimmage, he was a solid 40 yards from the play
The GOAT 
Yes. Stands means there is not enough evidence to over rule, but there is also not enough evidence to confirm the call was tight anyway, or confirm it. 
Are you using common core on that percentage? Stop being a victim. He got the touchdown...
No you see, UCF already won.
I agree, no way they should have been higher than 5th.
Haha, I knew when I posted that there was a 75% chance it would quickly come back to haunt me. :-(
Well there was no green between his foot and the sideline so he wasn't in which would make him...
Fortunately the sideline interference penalty only ended up probably costing about 5 yards of field position.
That was a gorgeous ball from Fromm, Christ. 
no good
I'm surprised they didn't cut to commercial during that review. 
You''re like a decade late 
On the wrong channel, Homers coverage is pretty dope.
The NFL could learn a thing or two about quick reviews. 
wasn't blown, it was a false start anyways so it would have had the same exact result.
I feel bad for Jalen Hurts
Yeah cause Hurts will either be gone or mysteriously dead. 
Not if it''s during a play that has an effect on the path of the ref. That could be an immediate ejection on the first penalty
Someone said Kirby was running down the sideline
Like what the fuck are you talking about?
I could only turn on the game after the half. Was Jalen Hurts that bad? I know that he's normally pretty god awful at passing, but was it worse than usual?
If anything that review confirmed how uneven that sideline edge is. In some spots he'd be out, others he'd be in.
TRUE FRESHMAN DRINK
Clemson beat Auburn, Auburn pooped on Georgia, then Auburn pooped on Bama, then Georgia pooped on Auburn, then Bama pooped on Clemson, now Georgia is pooping on Bama.......this season doesn't make any sense
Wait what was the sideline interference? 
TUA has a cannon 
Tua is a fucking gunslinger
We gonna win!  Go Dawgs!
quiet you!
almsost
Because there wasn't shit
Down the field passes in an SEC game? What is this?
Jake Fromm is the real deal tho
His foot made a football play toward the sideline 
Does hurts actually not know how to clap?
I''ll take three “Fuck Bama”
Yes
I'd say he's as close to out as physically possible, but still in
Not at all obvious to me.  I think they made the right call sticking with the decision on the field.   
Give time for defensive adjustments. 
What is this live feed bs I can''t read shit 
So does anyone got a clip of that sideline interference?
Holy fuck.... this guy. What an arm 
To be fair, that's every internet message board ever.
sssshhhhhhhh
South is weird af sometimes.
If you keep talking someone will **make** you sleep 
I didn't see a thing on that replay.
I think it was as close in bounds as you can get. Not on the line but no green in between either. 
Drink every time they say true freshman
ANOTHER TRUE FRESHMAN
So when are we gonna start hand trimming the sideline to make sure it''s completely straight and errant paint doesn''t change the call on the field? Replay review is a necessary evil, but it''s only going to get more nuanced from here out
Jalen doing his Jason Garret impression
Shut up...
Such poiseMuch accuracy
Great special teams play
watch the coaches film room. they are going over that. it was the ref from the line of scrimmage.

Damn, that pocket awareness is amazing for a freshman
The stunning thing is how bad this Bama D has been on 3rd and long
You know... so far Notre Dame has played Georgia closer than Bama has.
THERE ARE JUST SO MANY TRUE FRESHMEN
nice pocket awareness by Tua to avoid that rusher.  
Me as a freshman in college: eating frozen pizzas and watching boy meets world reruns.Fromm: throwing 80 yard touchdowns in the National Championship Game.
Espn stream is a slideshow
Agreed. Fromm has not been great at moments, but he's making enough good throws to put Georgia there.
Game O'' Finches 
There was a Broncos-Saints game a year or so ago that was won because after a blocked fg, they couldn't tell where the white of his shoes and white of the line were indistinguishable since the video was so blown out
They couldn't confirm whether he stepped out or not. So they just kept the ruling as it stood.
This "fuck it I'm going deep" offense is bad for my heart 
My man is gunnin that shit 
Put Hurts back in.  This guy keeps throwing deep, and he is making my heart drop every time.
Ah yes, just as we expected. A game of deep passes.
Bama gets the benefit 9 out of 10...this was the 10th time 
They will make up for it by cutting out the actual game play.
You could see a coach on the white of the sideline.  I think it was for blocking the ref from making it down the sideline (way behind the play mind you).
[deleted]
Back with the line judge. Multiple coaches in the white. Source: Watching all 22 coaches feed. Showed the replay like 10 times.
quality loss.
Wow, Tua actually has pocket presence.
Jalen Hurts looks dead inside 
Sideline inference 
I know they should have never let that coach go he beat a team that beat both these teams which is amazing.
Damn tua has a cannon
This Bama quarterback has some really good pocket awareness. 
I'm low-key rooting for Georgia because my high school stole their logo but I'm also low-key rooting for a buffalo wild wings situation with multiple overtimes because I don't want college football to end.
Good toss 
No one likes bama
eh, idk.
Oh god please win, Georgia. For America. 
...is the Georgia marching band really playing 'Battle Hymn of the Republic'?
Jalen Hurts looks fucking *pissed* lmao
Jumpin Jesus that was a great pass 
Jalen looks so awkward on the sideline
B1G has made a big deal this year on coaches being on the white.  
How many freshman are in this game lol 
Man I feel so sad for Hurts
TRUE FRESHMAN---DRINK!!
Lol I'm actually pulling for Georgia. The hate is strong.
I''m gonna pass. We have our own Flyin Hawaiian in Mc Milton to lead us to victory
Happened at the line, some UGA trainer/assistant ran in front of the ref.
'Cept that first-drive pick.
Nice kick and coverage.
Tua is very impressive moving around in the pocket
Mizzou y u show Bama our weakness 
Never
Keep fighting the good fight 
[deleted]
scary that bama has an actually really good qb for once...edit: lol immediately throws INT
Future Cleveland Brown Jake Fromm. 
Shitposting intensifies!!!!
Jalen Hurts is Sammy Davis Jr with dreds
Turning against? Other than 'Bama fans. Everyone else knows they were gifted this championship. 
Georgia is interfering with Alabama winning this game.
Don't you talk about Coach Feld like that. 
Starting RB?
Props to Jalen Hurts on being a classy teammate. I'm sure he's crushed, but supporting and helping, because that's what his team needs now
Bama slinging the ball down field Going for the big play is scary 
Lol I thought Tua was good
... but is Fromm a freshman or something?
Pretty great kick coverage there to absorb that penalty. 
Legitimate question: his foot touched the Alabama player who was out of bounds. Does this make him out of bounds? I thought so, but I could be wrong.
Kirby knows how much Saban pays
Hawaiian dude from the same high school as Mariota. Was like 4 start dual threat. 
UNLIMITED HOLDING
This kid has a cannon for an arm.
wild pocket presense tho
I doubt they had a camera on it. 
**H8 FEEDS THE DAWG**
DID YOU SAY TRUE FRESHMAN?
GUNSLINGER TUA!
Nice
Just "now"?
Maybe a little too out there conspiracy theory for even me:They did that last minute review of the catch so they didn't have to actually discuss the inexplicable sideline penalty. 
They never showed it.
Surprised Georgia isn't attacking the left side of Bama's line.
People are overrating both quarterbacks at the moment. 
coaches film room just broke it down. It happened, but 40 yards from the play. it was the line of scrimmage ref
ton of respect gained for Hurts
It looked like it may have been an assistant coach getting in the way of the officials ability to run down the sideline.
Uh oh. 
do i smell an interception coming
Man whole lot of deep shots all of a sudden
Bs 
I was surprised Hurts held the starting job for so long. Tua is the better option. I was just really surprised at the move, thought Saban would have a little more loyalty to his starter after so long. Edit: guess you jinxed him
"He's gotta be dying inside..."Ouch.
Dat pocket presence 
Damn Hurts looks so bummed out
Hey everybody, if you're streaming on espn, [this stream](http://www.espn.com/watch/_/id/3267580/sounds-of-the-game-2018-college-football-playoff-national-championship) is way better. No fuckin commentator's, great angles.
Where's Jeudy?
The ref felt it in his heart. 
I like less commercials good on you ESPN
Goddamn boys, we're shootin deep now...
ESPNews Film Room coverage is the truth. This needs to be a thing for every game.
How is touching someone who is out bounds mean that you are in bounds? Makes no sense to me 
Georgia''s mental toughness is really impressive. Going down big to Oklahoma and coming back, now responding to Alabama''s momentum with that huge TD. Very impressive.
Everyone''s corners are getting exposed 
Um... fuck Auburn?
Game. Over. 
I can't believe I'm actually enjoying watching Georgia play. 
...sigh...
All aboard!
ever...
Is this this NC game or the Freshman Bowl?
Lol someone on duckduckgo is a savage.https://i.imgur.com/eT95zFU.jpg
Bahahahahahahahahahahah
PIIIIICK!
Nah keep watching. But if bama scores again I'm gonna need you to go into a medically Induced coma
It must be nice to have multiple great QBs on your team to use :(
Let's go Georgia
I can''t even watch it. Won''t authenticate. Site is down. Fuck that service.
And watching the replay, the ref was completely out of the white and into the bench area when he ran into a Georgia person, there was no interference penalty.
Literally the most random penalty 
RB?
welp
Oh dear.
Yes!
Same here. They looked collected to me. 
inb4 Bama fans want Hurts back
what a pick
UH OH
LUL

Op.... well... not good 
Gotta say the coach coverage is too cool
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA 
Since when did the SEC abandon runs and start passing like crazy.
There it is!!!
I guess he is inexperienced.  Oops.
Hahahahahahaha lets goooooo
WOOOO LET'S GO
Sideline interference on y''all believe it or not 
BOOM
Havent been able to figure this out; Tagovailoa is left handed, Hurts is right handed. Does Alabama have to 'flip' their plays to make them work for a lefty QB?
This game has taken a full 180. First half was low scoring, ground and pound, 2nd half is all deep balls.
Its funny all these anti bama posters want to be mad at the refs but can't
ESPNews showed it and analyzed it.
I mean it's not like the refs are in college too. Both the NFL and the CFB have about the same level of skill/experience.
The fact that Bama is even in this is because the fix was in.
Kill me now
Rip
Hehe
Georgia going to pull this out
OOOOOOOOOHHH SHIT 
OOOOOO YEAH
OOF
Refs: Player number 102030405040302010 caught that ball, 1st down bama
Sideline penalty so likely there wasn''t a camera to get it. But probably a coach blowing up at a ref. 
The refs figured out the house Savanna promised was going to be shard between the whole crew and in a shut area of town. 
You don't see the auctioneer at mid field taking bids?
Weird rules. Why are some penalties reviewable and some aren't? The auburn Alabama game had a huge insane penalty on Alabama that couldn't be reviewed though it was obvious and Auburn had a guy 3 feet from off the field and it reversed a 30 yard sack and continued the drive for Bama. 
GA fans need to give Chaney credit. He's been brilliant tonight.

Close! 
It looked like it may have been an assistant coach getting in the way of the officials ability to run down the sideline.
As someone with money on the dogs, you're right. Had to be a suit saying "don't influence this game with a review" the call came so fast.
Lmao oh boy. Hero to zero in 5 minutes

There that flag is
Wow nice INT

What the fuck is this flag for 
Jesus, man. He wasn't even open when Fromm threw the ball. Fromm threw the ball on matchup and the route, seeing there was plenty of space to the outside. That's such a great play.
Is the tua train still chugging?
Freshman mistake. Touchdown here ices it
Saban still looking smart for benching Hurts to anyone?

that backfired on Saban 
QUIT THROWING FUCKING FLAGS
PUT HURTS BACK IN
Well this is ove
Miss_clementine or Miss Cleo?
He just couldn't get it there. He didn't look awful, just in no way playoff (or even top 10 team tbh) qb caliber
The announcer I'm listening to mentioned what the ref said.  Call stands basically means that they can't find 100% conclusive information from the replay, so they are keeping the given call
I mean, what did you expect?
put hurts back in
We just watched Hurts regain the starting job in real time LMFAO 
Lol that's what Alabama gets for not running the ball
Picked
ohh dawgs might take this over
are you too young to remember the string of Mormon Detmer brothers produced by BYU?
That clap from Hurts. Fuck haha.
Take the good with the bad with the freshman

Stands means no definitive evidence to overturn. Confirm means definitive evidence to support the call on the field. 
It's absolutely nutty that both of these teams have amazing QBs that the rest of the CFB world will have to deal with for multiple seasons.
BAH GAWD THAT''S FROMM''S MUSIC!
Come on with this sideline shit!
In b4 back to “Saban is a dumbass” 
...
He's been around soulless Saban too long. 
haha fuck off ref
Good thing hurts was on the bench.
SIT DOWN REF
He was trying to throw it away. Dude just has hops
rook can't do that
# Oh Boy
Oh this is not good for Alabama
Took off his helmet on the field
thats wikipedia
Some coach was in the way of the referee 
Georgia sideline is fucking up lol
That''s a true freshman mistake and that is the chance you take 
Beating Tua:1. Cover the slant2. See \#1
“We''re the red team right?” 
DAMMIT PART 2
[deleted]
Had a feeling ole boy was gonna have a turnover. 
GAME OVER MAN!!!!
Literally everyone has been saying that forever.
He moves around damn well.
Lotto numbers please
Georgia needs to get better hold me back coaches
Jalen threw one INT all year to 17 TDs. ONE.
Sideline warning omg
God damn I can''t wait to listen to Finebaum tomorrow.
Mike Gundy on drugs. He's asking if a ball runner touches a defender who is out of bounds whether or not the ball runner is out. Wtf is he thinking?
It's over Bammers... suck it.  Saban can't win the big one anymore, past his prime. 
Ball game. 
Coached by Butch Jones for MAX MEME. 
Well it was fun while it lasted. Lol
Oh fuck you in just the worst way refs
Let em fuckin play refs 
Did she say "Atlanta"?
Of course flag. Give it back to bama
Absolutely.

Georgia get your sideline shit together already
Do we have to throw a flag after every big play, really?
 Freshman mistake
Tua sucks
That could never go wrong.
None of the receivers were even looking
The classic freshman mistake happened.
Goddamn. Watching Georgia play this game makes me so damn proud of the Sooners and Riley for giving them a 2OT game. Go dawgs! 
#L O L R E F S
Fucking watchespn
Ticky tack sideline garbage. 
PICK!
Annnnnd that's the downside of turning to a Freshman backup QB in the national title game
America 20, Alabama 7.
Put Hurts back in
Oh fuck off refs 
THIS KILLS THE TIDE!
Tide Roll?
TUA GONNA BE SHOOK 
This sideline warning thing is fucking stupid
1st sideline warning? Thought it was their second?
Alabama deserves this. 
What the dick is a sideline warning?
Big 10 refs not enjoying the level of politeness from the GA bench lololololol 
Mmm soooo now what Alabama optimists? 
kirby chill the fuck out
There is the someone who hasn't played all year.
should had thrown it away
They needed a change of pace.... for the rest of the game. Hurts had like 21 yards passing in the 1st half. He was only looking for short passes and was taking off to run almost instantly. 
[deleted]
Okay now if someone can just beat the god damn Patriots since they're going to the damn Super Bowl again that'd be great
Stay in the damn sidelines Georgia
Fromm and Tua are both going to be around the SEC for at least two more years and for an LSU fan that's a bit scary.
What's up with the UGA sideline?
Someone make a gif of sad sideline clapping Jaylen. 
So many people were waiting for that freshman mistake, here it is. 
If you are drinking when they say true freshman, RIP
Hurts unpacking his bags
REALLLLLLLLLLLLY???????? AGAIN? Fuck these refs.
how was that their first warning when they just had a flag against them? 
If bama loses, it certainly isn''t the refs'' fault. They are helping them out as much as they can.
back to hurts?
I knew he was going to throw an interception 
New QB can't handle it all! 
B A K E R 
EVERYTHING IS AWESOME!
Who the hell did he think he was throwing that to?
And that''s when we realize he''s just a freshman 
Where's the Getback! coach?
It took a while, but finally we see the first freshman mistake of the game
Fuck your sideline 
Who is the number 11 receiver for Bama? I thought I heard the announcers say he was also a freshman?
Their first? Just got a 15 yarder. Lol
Things falling apart for Bama
What the fuck is a sideline warning?
RIP Tua. 2018-2018
these roll plays are such trash.  because you force throws into tight windows and are pressed on time.
But Tua is the savior! Whaaaaaa
High Risk/High Reward but shooters shoot.
Missed the some of the second quarter until now... why is jalen hurts not playing?
This is why you don''t put a true freshman in
Another sideline warning
#SIDELINE GATE
[Holy shit he called it] (https://twitter.com/tj_lsudad/status/950574727063658497)
Did the safety just tap his veins after the interception?
Dat is not de wey
Lmao sideline calm down
ALABAMA QUARTERBACKS FUCKING SUCK
Rut roh
eek
Refs are planning to eject the entire Georgia sideline at the start of the fourth
Debbie Downer ref over here
WTF is this sideline bullshit.  Calm down refs. 
ENOUGH SIDELINE PENALTIES
How is ESPN going to spend 3 hours bragging about all the camera angles and not even show us one replay of the sideline interference?
that sideline is pushing buttons
There was a line to intercept that ball.  Take a number.
Georgia's sideline needs to stop being dumb lol
He's college football's Jeremy Jamm.
Whats all this sideline crap?
[Obviously I meant to say the second half of the national championship game more specifically...](https://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/66xcrn/comment/dgm4vi8?st=JC73I3BS&sh=0d26a118) 
Sideline warning after an infraction and it doesn't call a play back.  Football rules are incredibly dumb.
I'm about ready to die.
WE WANT BAMA
Let the kids have fun. Fuck all this sideline warnings BS 
GEORGIA IS GOING TO WIN THE NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP
I feel bad for Jalen, he looks so sad
What are all these sideline warning??
Adios Tagovailoa
so happy, let's fucking go baby WOOT WOOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I picked it specifically because of your username
they also called the sideline interference a "dead ball" foul... which seems like a contradiction. that whole thing seems fucked
Fire Saban ;)
Ok. Yeh that was a bit of a sideline. 
Never heard of that penaltyAnd the ref cut himself off
Saban fucked up
Hahaha i swear to god refs 
There you go D!
Lol what
Yes
Hey I like your flairs ;) but I couldn't agree more lol
So what was the sideline warning for specifically?
Sideline warning?? LuL
The fuck with this sideline bullshit
Why was there even the sideline warning?
My man Baker!
STAY OFF THE FUCKING FIELD! 
Same. I've seen warnings, but that's it.
How do you get a sideline warning after you already have a sideline penalty infraction lol??
How do you get a sideline warning after you've already had an infraction?
Welp, drink everything you've got tonight boys
Watch out Big Ten refs HATE FEEDS THE DAWG
It's okay. Don't panic and throw Hurts back in. 
DeAndre Baker was all over teh place against Oklahoma, he's going places
Saban to put himself in
what was that
Sum fuckin trash. Could these refs be any more biased? 
WTF kind of throw was that!?
Fuck these refs
Sideline interference doesn't count as a sideline warning?
Tua has incredible awareness on the pocket and..... Ok... Nvm
Put Kirby on an actual dog leash. 
Kirby needs to crack down on that sideline.
Not afraid to launch it till his picked off. lol
The coaches stream.rewound it, the ref at the line of scrimmage ran into a coach waaaaaaay behind the play
Chaos
These refs can get fucked.
UGA sideline is fuckin wilin out, love it. 
Kirby''s handler really fucking up right now
Fuck these refs and their sideline bs
GET FUCKED BAMA 
Okay, what is this sideline bullshit they keep calling?
FUCKING SHIT PANTS GUY! DO YOUR JOBBBBB!!
Jesus fucking christ
OH. MY. FUCKING. GOD. 
 Lol there it is... smh
They gave a warning after a sideline penalty?
whats with the sideline warnings?? is no one holding Kirbys pants?!
How do you get a warning after a foul for the same thing?
The fuck was he throwing that to? His receivers weren''t even facing him
Fun police at it again
Getting close to ballgame if Georgia gets points off this 
Somebody needs to hold Kirby''s dockers.  
I-N-T!
Okay so why did they get a penalty and then a warning? 
man fuck these refs we don't claim them
THEM GOOD BOYES IS HELL
Isn't that UGA's second sideline warning? 
Hey refs go fuck yourselves
If Hurts is looking to transfer, his statline tonight puts him right down Notre Dames alley. We will welcome you with open arms 
I like life so I''ll pass
It's hilarious to me how much SCar fans seem to care about a Clemson comment or two.  They still skullfucked you, get the fuck over it.
Did the wr think it was a run play? 
PUT IN BRANDON PETERS. 3RD STRING IS OBVIOUSLY THE BEST
Remember when everyone said he was the best qb in the whole wide world
Lineman 5 yards downfield that wasn't even flagged but alright
Well this game is fucking over.  Kirby is the new Saban. 
I''ve never seen so many sideline calls
Yeah. Beginning of the end there. 
Georgia needs to get some kind of pass rush here.
Dude Kiffin needs to shut the fuck up and just coach, he's hurting his team 
Dat forced throw
Yeah, I was thinking the same thing. That's a rule, right?
No. I like this. Keep Tua in. 
Hmm...> Defensive slug-fest in the first half.>Offensive shoot-out in the second half.Yup, that's a Football Mullet -- business in the front, party in the back!
How does sideline interference not count as a warning as well?
Georgia sideline hype af lol
This ref has a hard on for the sideline stuff. It's the national championship game man loosen up a bit.
What is a sideline warning/interference? Legit asking Edit: Thanks everyone!!
That WR was so confused.
“Penalty on Georgia. We don''t know what for but Bama''s check cleared”
And that's why you don't start a true-true freshman in the second half of the championship game 
 A BUNCH OF YALL CALLED THAT
BABOOM
"first" sideline warning
Hahahahahahaha I hope saban is happy now be benching hurts.Also hope hurts is like "that's a good for ya"
Fucking love it
Told you guys you were gooooooood
Hot Take
cross the bridge when you get to it. if you go for it and don't get it, they can take lead with a td and two field goals.
UGA is fuckin feeling itThis is an awesome game
All I''m saying is Jalen wouldn''t have made that throw... or any throw
Refs don''t like fun
Get Kirby's pants wrangler back in there!
Seniors don''t throw to blocking Wide Receivers 
Fire get me back coach 
D I L L Y  D I L L Y
Damn.
Yeah, that throw was shit. 
Another flag on Georgia Jesus Christ. 
Must have gotten in the way of a ref. Can''t imagine interfering with a player is a dead ball foul 
Or maybe 2nd down?
Truer words have never been spoken
Who would win? An SEC champ or 1 flaggy boi?
Wow, the WR didn't realize it was being thrown at him.
Theyy need to stfu with that sideline bullshit
Gorgeous snag
YEAHHHHH
freshman gonna freshman
ROLL DAWGSdid I do it?
This shit is over. Alabama can''t do anything on offense.
THERE IT IS
Aaand that''s why you don''t give a true freshman his 1st meaningful minutes in the 2nd half of the national championship game 
kirby just stinkeyein' ref lmao. no fun allowed.
Terrible decision, Great decision, terrible decision again.  Freshman QB in his first big game ever.
NOM NOM NOM
GO DAWGS
THEM DAWGS IS HELL
Well, it was fun while it lasted, Tua
LEGENDS LETS GO GA
Big 12 after dark?
Just remember folks, this is a Georgia team we're talking about here. We've done this before. 
Nobody knows. 
What's all this tickytack sideline bullshit they keep calling on UGA? 
And this game just got even better
and that's why you don't trust a guy with his first start in a national championship game
Fuck that''s game 
Damn dawgs chill on that sideline
What's up with all the sideline calls tonight?
BigXII shootout in national championship
What's with all the sideline shit going on with Georgia lmao
Jebus Kirby get yer shit together 
He threw that straight in Tua his hands.  I''ll see myself out.
Tua soon
These refs are such killjoys
#GAME. BLOUSES
That should do it 
He might actually cry
“How does it feel to be benched in the National Championship?”“Hurts.”
How do you get a sideline penalty and then a sideline warning?
But... But I thought Tua was the next Joe Montana
Dude looks like he's ramming something up an imaginary ass.
LETS FUCKING GOOOOO
G
Lol at he's face when he threw the flag
Wait how is that their first sideline warning if they just got penalized 15 yards because of sideline interference or whatever?
Put his ass on a leash 
If they got a sideline interference penalty, how is the sideline warning their first?
Coach already thinking about tonight, get your head in the game
AHHHH HAHAHAHAHA! DEFENSIVE *MOMENTUM SHIFT* BOYS!
Lol the Bama WRs were not ready
Freshman 
Oh god. Stfu ref. Thank god georgia is killin it!!!
TV hasn't even shown it, unless one of the other feeds had it
Shouldnt the actual flag for sideline interference be their first warning?  Lol. 
refs don't like the party on the Georgia sideline
you get a sideline penalty! you get a sideline penalty! everybod- oh... oh just us?
The Georgia hometown stream has a camera constantly on Kirby and I love it. 
GO DAWGSSSS SIC 'EM!!!!!!!!!!
Take a shot when the comments says "true freshman"
Soooo if this ends the way it's going now, would Saban have ruined two quarterbacks? 
Fuck these refs and their sideline warning bullshit
LOL? Holy shit you Bbulldogs fans are becoming unbearable 
Jesus, refs. Let the fucking sideline celebrate.
Refs are fine, that's football. 
If Georgia scores here it's over.
Did anybody see what happened with the sideline interference? In all the replays I didn''t see anythingEdit: And now with the warning, are the refs just being dicks? Or am I missing something?
Georgia is about to get (and deserve ) a sideline penalty
Big 10 refs trying their best to find a way to keep bama in it
let's go for the jugular!
LMFAO REFS
Game over, man! Game over!
Dude stop, right now. Stop!
yeah about that..
Lmao, see what you want man. I don't care about either team and it was pretty obvious he wasn't in.
Bold move to call a pass play with all of the receivers blocking downfield
RIP TUA HYPE 2018-2018
Thats a petty call. Kirby was holding them back.
Tua to the Rescue....lol! Back down to earth boys
These refs doing everything they can to keep Bama in the game.
INT!Knew that was inevitable
Team Meteor right?
Shitty call. 
QB change makes no sense to me.
Hyped. But they need to get their sideline under control. Also 1st?
These fucking refs.
Welp back to Hurts 
These refs aren't playing around with the Georgia sideline
EXCESSIVE JUICE WARNING ON THE UGA SIDELINE!
Charles Woodson looks at that pick and nods in silent approval.
Jake “Literally Tom Brady/Bobby Orr” Fromm
What an incredible catch
But guys Tua is the next coming of Brady
That's on Ridley, not the QB. Ridley was blocking on a pass play.
How do you get a sideline interference call without getting a sideline warning?
Kirby Smart thinks visors are cool at least
aaaaaand there it is
FUCK
Damn...what are the powerball numbers for this Wed?!
Yup I''m almost at booting up my PS4 point now
Kirb's pants holder is falling down on the job. 
I'm A tRuE fReShMaN
Man fuck these refs.
RIP
Georgia coach needs to dial it down. He's as undisciplined as his players.
> some team gets a call in its favor"The refs sure are pulling for some team to win this game" ~ r/cfb
All receivers there thought it was a run... Wtf
How do you get a sideline interference penalty and then a warning?
PuT TuA In
Refs fixed that INT too, I'm sure.   
night night 
Like the one bama receiver stopped and was like huhhhh whut happen mama
I hope UGA burns to the ground
No problem - it's only their first warning.
Well there's Tua's 1, time for 16 more TDs. 
...... And that's why Hurts started. 
where is the get back guy ?
#WOOO LETS GO DAWGS
True freshman makes true freshman mistake. Big if true
Put a leash on Kirby damn lmao
george
Fuck this just put me back on suicide watch.
WE'RE JUST REALLY HAPPY OKAY GAWWWWW
UGA getback coaches not doing their job well
Ref just looking for anything to throw that flag. Sideline interference? Fuck off
Damn why couldn''t bama have done this against us??
THE GODS ARE JUST
Does Jalen change his phone background to Tua on that last drive?
Stay the fuck off the field
Ok well Tua had a downside 
LOL bama 
Can the refs rule an illegal INT.
Bama 7Georgia 20Sidelines 2
Damn. We're going to lose this game and still be the team that you wish your team were.Keep going. I'm almost there.
RIGHT?!
"Joy and happiness from the Georgia sideline"
Damn he has an arm
Yayyyyy Taken 7
Kirby Smart — the 12th man
[deleted]
Cant even be excited for your team . Bullshit refs.
Refs are doing everything they can lol
Shoulda played Hurts. Hurts throws that away all day. Saban lost the game. End of a dynasty.
Lol good call
BRING HURTS BACK!!!HAHAHAHAHA
lol the receiver''s foot touched the defender when he fell out of bounds!!!
Lineys be trippin 
Not being Alabama apparently
Ya fuck... 
THE GOOD BOYS ARE EATING. WHO ARE THE GOOD BOYS, GEORGIA? WHO ARE THE GOOD BOYS?
Tua comes in and throws a TD, and they back up UGA, oh boy we have all the momentum!Annnnnnnnnnnnnnd it's gone
That Hurts
This game is playing out like the original Star Wars trilogy
Oops, threw it Tua guy on the wrong team 
Guys I called the pick on this drive, is you want proof just act my family
Been a thing all year. Directive came down at the start of the season to crack down. 
I wish Clemson would've won.  It would be such a better game.
Not anymore!
Dammit Saban wtf
They done
uhhhh, I was gonna boycott this game and try to find snap chats of UCF's parade(true national champs), but I caved and now I'm watching the SECCG part 2...........
Sideline penalties are you serious? 
Not so fast
tugovolaia.exe crashed
Lol touche
DAMN IT 1 off
A new table for his bowl win trophies. 
I was making fun of the guy holding Kirby Smart back all game, but it seems like he plays a vital role after all
I mean this same referee penalized Harbaugh for throwing a clipboard.
Wow these refs are pathetic.
quarterbacks and kickers, mannn
Okay, thank you. They didn't talk about it at all on the broadcast.
This ref is annoying. Let them have fun. 
Flag!!!
Saban should bench Tua for Jalen Hurts
F U C K  B A M A
damn
Because beatin' Bama in the NCCG is HYPE
And again! Idk what's going on over there
Piss off jort
And now you see why Kirby needs a handler. 
wait what the fuck was that playcall?nobody turned around to receive the ball
That was a ticky tacky sideline warning call.
This is beautiful
Damn, calm down Dawgs sideline!
Freshman mistake, might cost us the game. 
Ouch. Probably a reason why Bama was reluctant to start Hurts. Doesn't make huge plays but doesn't turn the ball over much either
That''s what it looked like
Bait
Georgia doesn't get hyped they STAY HYPED!
Damn, I was just thinking "This freshman QB keeps throwing like he is, he's gonna throw a pretty big pick at some point tonight." And... boom
DAWGS IS HELL
Make a big play in the biggest game of your career. Better not celebrate. 
Another sideline penalty... jesus.
Wow.  Both these teams look slow.
Kirby can't keep his ass on the sidelines
"Let's settle down the excitement Georgia Sideline. Can't have too much momentum"- The Refs, probably
put this away dawgs.
Dies immediately after comment 
But apparently he''s bad enough to deserve being guillotined.
Agreed
Georgia scores a TD... random flag for sideline. Georgia gets pick, sideline gets warned. What is going on
Georgia does something good = Sideline warning
These refs are being such fucking losers. People get on the field all the fucking time after plays like that
Kirby wrangler needs to get his shit back together...
Suck it ref that was a huge play. That happens every game without a sideline warning 
GEORGIA I HAVE ADOPTED YOU AS MY SEC EAST TEAM
Hurts wasn't doing shit. Have to keep Tua in. 
lmao
It's beautiful 
None of bamas players were on the same play there
OMG TUA TUA TUA HURTS SUX...oh wait he has zero experience...
I'm gonna guess that the sideline interference was somebody stepping in front of the dashed line, interfering with the referee running down behind the play.  
[Or maybe he wont...](https://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/7p48fo/game_thread_cfp_ncg_georgia_vs_alabama_8pm_et/dseexmy/)
Wait I thought they already had a sideline thing.
T4ken: The Train
Very very bad decision right there
 Never mind. That aged poorly 
Georgia, I love you so much right now!
I have never seen that shit called on the sideline like that
Did you know neither Bo nor Harris have touched the ball this half?
As an Ohio State fan this is entertaining as fuck. 
Holy shit
Fucking Savage
And back to the bench
yeeeeeesssss!! please let this be the end of the reign of terror
Alabama misses the LANE TRAIN!!!
GG
Of course there''s a flag 
Daaaammmmmnnnnnnnn
Is the pressure getting to Saban?!?!
This is over for Bama
Refs have been told to make it a game so people watch 
yeah I think Bulldogs have gameplanned this well eh?
We don't have a senior QB
 don't jinx us yet
Called that bitch. haha
Salt
FIRE KIRBY''S GET BACK COACH
Hot Take: If UGA wins, Early Cuyler will finally be a good father to Rusty Cuyler. 
THE IVORY MARKET IS GOING STRONG
I dont know how much of this game is left, but I'm going to get real weird with it.
I feel like we'll be sick of Georgia in 10 years like we are of Alabama now
Had to step away for a bit and just came back for the first time in the second half - did Alabama bench Hurts in the NCG?
So for these Liam Neeson action films... can they give him some sort of motivation other than him having to save his family?
Most casual fucking flag ever lmao
REFS HATE FUN!
HOLY FUCK THAT WAS THE SIDELINE INTERFERENCE? THAT WAS IT THERE?
Oh hey a mistake from someone who hasn't played at all this year. Shocking.
What the fuck was that call? Such BS
WOOOOOO
Get outta here
How is first sideline warning after a sideline infraction?
Game, BLOUSES!
Warnings come after infractions?
Fuck off refs
Chill refs. A bunch of young guys excited for the most important game of their lives so far. Just chill.
Fuck these refs
BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Nice of them to finally give a first warning.
Three wide recievers and not one was looking for the ball there. wow.
ESPN official site laggy as hell, I'm assuming?
What?
Nice throw!
Running on the field, I'd assume
Y'know, I want to be fine with y'all winning. But you're making it really hard for me to be fine with y'all winning.
Saban? Lmao
Hurts was definitely smarter about throwing away the ball when there was nowhere to go with it.
Jalen wouldn''t have been that accurate for the pick
Kirby's pants guy lol
WHO'S THAT COMING DOWN THE TRACK
What is all this sideline bullshit? Can anyone elaborate or is this a ruse to distract us from something
WoW wHaT a GrEaT tR0o FrEsHmAn
It means *get the hell off the field*
"No having fun near the football field!"
"Georgia has too much Gatorade on the sidelines, 60 yard penalty and automatic loss of one player of our choosing."
So can we criticize the Saban for sitting hurts yet?
Posting is pointless right now 
How is that not their second sideline warning?
Lol Saban
Somebody remind these BIG refs that Bama isn''t Ohio State
Isn't that the second sideline warning?
He's just extra hyped. I like that 
RIP Tua hype, 10 minutes ago - now
What an emotional rollercoaster this quarter 
On to the third string....
Refs are squares.
RIP Hawaii boy
Wow these refs are sooo gayyy
Some ref bullshit
Uhhhh. Yeah
So, uh.. they gonna throw any flags against Bama this half?
Whoooooo! Go dawgs!!*vomits violently*
Lol... got a first warning after a penalty.
What happened to 52 Clark that beasted Oklahoma? Haven't seen him at all today.
Did Hurst get injured or did they really just pull him for a freshman?
Anytime there''s a play that bad for Bama the dawgs pick up a penalty. 
I hardly watch any college football, but it seriously does seem like the refs are trying anything they can to help Alabama. 
These refs getting fucked like their conference
I feel like every hype game the refs make sure to call sideline warning
The CG in that Liam Neeson train movie is fucking tragic. 
Where the hell is UGA's get back guy!? He's blowing it!
How many flags he got?
screenshotting and commenting to come back just in case
B1G with their side lines rules.   LOL.
#STFU REFS
I'm not saying Hurts wouldn't have thrown a pick there, but we'll never know.
One more score and it''s a wrap. Yeah I said it
Hey refs, cut Georgia some slack.  They've never been to a championship game.  They don't know the rules.
Why do I have to work tomorrow?
These refs 
Bama easily has the potential to score 28+ in a quarter. Georgia NEEDS a touchdown heading into the fourth in order to win this game. 
Penalty is for obstructing the sideline ref
That is a pretty uneven line
Chubb is strong up the middle.   Bama doesn't allow that.
Bama is fucked. It's all downhill from here. 
My God these refs are rustling my jimmies
Tua got cocky. He should have just thrown that away
LOLOLoLOLOloL
Well so do we next year 
Because you aren''t as good as Georgia?
I didn't go to a public school, I probably had a better edu than you. Especially seeing as you have to copy what I said about being a victim.
Damnnnnnnn.... who let the dawgs out!
I bet Lane Kiffin is really, really enjoying this game.
Kirby Smart has lost control of his sideline
Dumbfuck B1G ref trying to be bigger than the game. Fuck him
As someone who lives in Alabama... I'm enjoying this game so far.  The amount of salt I'll see all day at work tomorrow will be quite fun.
CHOP CHOP CHOP
These fuckass refs man!!! Get laid you bitches God damn.
Kirby was doing his best, but come on--he knew that was going to be flagged. Quit bitching about every call. There's not even any yardage on the penalty.
Oh now they're against putting the frosh in. GTFO.
BELT GUY YOU HAD ONE JOB
These refs have no clue
Quick guys, what penalty can we call on Georgia?
What up with all the sideline warnings?
It's been almost 40 yrs give us a break
Sideline warning for celebration. The other penalty was for interference
Generally you have to adjust some for a leftie. You would normally roll them left rather than right, for example. 
Are you Scottish or drunk 
Nope.
Brb dying. This state will be insufferable 
That's kinda what Saban gets for benching a two year starter for a freshman in this kind of pressure, regardless of who is the better natural quarterback.
Lol threw the flag right in Kirbys face
Oh MAN! TAK3N ON A TRAIN!!! 
That WR had to go up for that ball. At least fight off the catch don't just stand there
Bama has the best recruiting class in a row for years  and can't get a QB who can make throws? WTF.
I know they already won one championship game but, Alabama in CFP championships LUL 
Yeah 5 minutes ago?
I love this
Yes you do 
Hahahahbahahah fuck you Saban
Huge game kids are excited wtf ref
This is your chance Georgia. Your chance to end them. Do it.
What is Jalen Hurts record as a starter?  They haven''t mentioned it yet.
God fuck these refs. Jesus Christ 
I love this game
Can Georgia still Win if their Entire Sideline is Ejected? LOL
What's up with Georgia and the sideline?
Did Ridley just give up on that one? WTF was that!
Kirby my man. Take it easy on the sideline. I'm loving the passion but STAHP.
Hurts looks like a real estate agent.
no u
LMAO that''s what you get Nick!Put the Houston kid back in!!
Players and/or coaches not staying on the sideline and getting in the way of refs 
Maybe Kirby was the true Saban all along...
Cause I'm a Pats fan and have wishful thinking 
Wow. Georgia balling out and overcoming right now.
Fire the guy that's supposed to be holding Kirby's belt! 
Belt boy apparently needs to be there. 
That whole offense was confused.
that's what happens when you cheat though. Karma is a real thing.
Holy shit these refs are out to get us 
CAN WE STOP WITH THE SIDELINE WARNINGS IN THIS SPORT AND LET THE KIDS CELEBRATE?! Thanks
DYNASTY OVER LULZ
Ahh so now you can''t celebrate?
Jalen can't get it done, Tua too inexperienced.  Out of options.  Defense has got to win this one for Bama or it's over.... Congrats Dawgs...
WOW
They keep this shit up I won't be playing around with these refs
Lol
No shit, it's just funny how they always act like its a huge deal when the play counts either way. 
Freshman mistake. Theres a lot of,time left in the season for the great Tide coaching staff to,iron those kinds of errors out.
If Georgia scores a touchdown this game is over
Plz Georgia 
It's been 0 seconds since the announcer said "true freshman" 
What is going on on Georgia's sideline?
THEM DAWGS IS HELL
It looked like it may have been an assistant coach getting in the way of the officials ability to run down the sideline.
Like landing on someone doesn't make you down. Have to touch ground out of bounds.
It's almost like Bama fans forgot he was a freshman... 
Would''ve been nice to get this Bama last week...
H8 FEEDS THE DAWG
This is a ridiculous display of "officiating". Every play Georgia makes is having a flag called on it, these refs REALLY REALLY REALLY want Alabama to win this game.Disgusting.
Uh oh.  Back to Hurts.
Is it too late to get AJ back?
Welcome back Jalen Hurst. We still know ye.
sorry if it's been asked, why is UGA allowed to have a home game in the National championship game? #signed every UM fan that had to deal with wiscon fans asking.
My guess is it was a timing route.
Yep 
Does anyone have a clip of the “sideline interference” that caused the penalty during the UGA touchdown? They didn''t show it as far as I know. 
Maybe we need to replace Kirby''s holder with a TRUE FRESHMAN 
Lmao did y''all see Kirby''s face when that ref threw the flag right in front of him?
And that's the end of the Tagovailoa  era...
That HURTS Tua....that HURTS 
the georgia get back coach really sucks at his job
Kirby got sideline penalties as bamas DC too, he just likes being on the field
I saw that too. Ridley was trying to block Baker.
Sucks to be a Vols fan and have to play them both every year
If Alabama did that it wouldn't have been called.
As long as it's against Georgia. 
Celebrating 
That''s why Bama doesn''t pass!
Those were two pretty fucking soft sideline penalties
Liam Neeson in Liam Neeson has TAKEN the train. 
Called 3rd down... Damn so close
lol @ that confused looking Bama receiver with his hands up
Get the sideline belts dammit!
FUCK MY LIFE
There's the freshman
Played like booty
You're crazy
I'm telling you guys, is was Kirby all along!
The Georgia coaches got to calm the fuck down lol 
Will Alabama facemask somebody on this drive again? 
These refs salty af Bama is losing lol. 
Looks like we are gonna lose but I''m excited about Tua. Watching him just step up in the pocket to dodge the pressure was great. 
"The commuter" is the most banal name for a thriller ive ever heard
He tried lmao
You could see a coach on the white of the sideline. I think it was for blocking the ref from making it down the sideline (way behind the play mind you).
He's garbage. 
What the hell... these refs are clearly trying to fuck Georgia? Are they not allowed to celebrate a pick?
These refs are making the Big Ten look bad. Go Georgia!
>put a true freshman who has never started in at QB at halftime of the national championship game>get surprised when the does that>the city of nicholas lou saban junior>the city of tuscalooserhow will he ever live this down
Don't jinx it!
It would be 20-0 if it were Hurts.
Fuck these refs.  
Y'all got anymore of them QB's?
These refs can go back to Alabama knowing they tried their hardest
Georgia disagrees with that assessment. 
First warning maybe? The other was a sideline penalty? 
Wut
Low Tide? 
Well now I believe it! True NCG was played last week! So hyped for next season now. 
I think the Browns can beat this Bama team.
Guys, we're only 1.5 quarters away from the offseason... I'm sad
Refs looking to throw a flag on Georgia for anything. 
That was one of the worst passes I've ever seen.
Don't get too cocky yet dawg bro
Close enough
and they could (have) taken the lead with just two touchdowns. looking less likely now though. 
IS THIS WHERE I YELL THEM DAWGS IS HELL DONT THEY
What is the sideline warning?
Usually sideline personnel stepping onto the field.
That Rookie studied at the Sexy Rexy School of "Fuck It I'm Going Deep!"
lol
Let's calm down it's still the 3rd quarter
LOL cry moar
YES YES YESSSSSSSSSSS!DILLY  MOTHERFUCKING DILLY 
The freshman qb who hasn't played all season forced a bad pass.  Not really that shocking.
Lmao that bald guy trying to hold back everyone. 
LOL refs telling the Georgia sideline to get fucked...twice!
Ridley the elder has had a rough night
GIVE HURTS A SHOT. WTF IS SABAN DOING??!?!!?!?
they got a penalty for the first one assessed on the kickoff
Why does it seem all strength and conditioning coaches are bald and mean looking?
Still can't believe there's two train-related drama movies being released pretty much one after the other
Looked like the recievers were blocking their...broken play?
I'm feeling a UGA turnover here. But maybe that's just wishful thinking.EDIT - I did good?
Guys that wasn''t that big of a ball chill out 
yeah shoulda called it over when y'all did.
Salt coming out early tonight fellas
They normally kick from the 35.
Umm you can celebrate the INT after the whistle, are you guys fucking stupid.
Title drought about to be 2 years. THINK OF THE CHILDREN.
THEM DAWGS IS HELL DONT THEY
Do the refs know what a sideline is?
Thiese sideline calls are bullshit. Not interfering with the game. 
Goooooo dawwwwwwgs
This is a good game
We can't recruit QBs for shit.
Lol
Wait until the game is over to be salty. And flair up!
PUT IN MCCARRON
Bama what is you doing
Do these idiots calling this game not realize that every receiver on that play was blocking and not looking for a pass?  They didn't force anything, they called the wrong play.
This was their first warning.  The other was a full penalty, not a warning.  :)
Because it would not help Bama with field position
I always thought it's when the bench enters the field, but that's just my best guess
I agree wholeheartedly
Lmao the Georgia sideline is wild af rn
That''s the ugliest play I''ve seen from Alabama in a decade.
LOL WTF is going on over on the Georgia sideline 
Players went too far on the field.
I mean they didn't call dpi
Lol
What happens after a second sideline penalty?
That was deserved though
* true freshman mistake *
Facemasks have been less enforced than sidelines in this game.
Kirby and the sideline have no chill!!!
What the fuck was that sidline infraction. That is straight up fuckery
What the fuck is going on with the sideline ref on the Georgia side?  Did his wife leave him today or something?
Bruh, these refs hate the sideline.
Maybe if the refs paid more attention to the game than the sidelines they'd stop blowing so many calls.
It''s the perfect temperature to chill my beers right outside on the windowsill - it''s pretty great 
This pleases me.
Interference occurs specifically during the play, sideline warning is an after the play foul.
Designed run.  Georgia had good coverage and he tried to make a play, stupidly.
thats a good show
shhhhhhhhh
That works!
"Sideline warning, too much fun, defense."
Seriously, fuck these refs
Dawgs need to stand in the first row just to be sure.
Would that be OPI if he somehow completed it? The two WR were blockingEdit: I guess it was just a miscommunication or something. Should've been a run or RB screen
This is a rollercoaster of emotions.
FUCK this is gold actually
[deleted]
These refs are trying to make sure they get enough camera time. We're not here to watch you. 
Dude. Kirby. Keep your ass off the field. What you gonna do guy if that ends up actually affecting the game, extending a Bama drive or what not. 
Kirby needs to be a bit more aware of whether he's on the field if the refs are going to be this stingy about it
We all dem dawgz tonight
Coaches and players on the sideline stepping on the field. Usually called if they block the path of the refs. 
Wtf dude
Kiffin?
Every receiver was blocking downfield. How do they fuck that play up so badly?
sideline interference as a penalty doesn't count as a warning I guess
I don't understand what a side penalty is that was called earlier on the UGA touchdown and why it was a deadball foul but it happened during the play?
The receivers were all blocking and he just threw it up anyway. They could be Garrett Gilberting him here if they aren't careful with what they ask of him
that was fair though. kirby himself his getting buck fucking wild. like hes headed to buckhead right after the game or some shit
You know they have to be the highest rated B1G refs to get the championship game. 
Pulled him
Don't they
The heel definitely comes down on the line.
Someone please tell me I''m not the only one who''s noticed that Kirby usually has a guy holding his belt on the sideline. Dude is not doing his job tonight apparently.
wtf are these sideline penalties??
This sideline warning ref needs to fuck off. It's the god damn national championship. Unless people are physically impeding your ability to referee, don't fucking call a penalty that's rarely called, let alone twice. 
Did they bench Hurts?!
Idk, when we taught jalen to throw it away, he never threw it again
It's almost like they're trying to make us think it's rigged.
Why were three WR''s blocking on a rollout pass?
Jalen is a bad passer, but doesn't make mistakes. Tua is better, but is inexperienced and likely will. Saban rolled the dice on a better passer since he didn't think Hurts could bring them back. I don't blame him, but it's bizarre to not be starting the guy you have faith in throwing you to a victory in the first place.
They really just pulled him
Ridley looking for the flag when he should've been playing and stopping the int.
Come on.  It's the national championship.  Chill on the sideline crap.
What are the refs penalizing the Georgia bench for? Celebrating a big play? C'mon now lmao
H8 H8 H8 H8
Apparently, this situation isn't covered in the rules.
Ready, Fire, Aim! It's the B1G way
Sideline interference is not the same as sideline warning.
Can anyone explain why sideline interference would be a dead ball foul? Couldn't a coach just trip a DB and have a TD still stand?
Great defensive play, terrible terrible throw. 
This is the difference between Jake Fromm and Kelly Bryant 
Bruh, this is like Vader throwing Palpatine down that poorly placed shoot to nowhere.
I was wondering the same.
Nah the first was an actual penalty for sideline interference? I'm honestly not sure what the difference is
I'd like to request an anti-herbstreit flair, please. 
All the wr's had their backs turned who was he throwing to?
"Put in the backup qb!" -Bama fans lol
Now Saban will be second-guessing his QB choice.
Good job, Kirby. Great team, you guys deserve the win. GG
What the fuck is a sideline warning
I like how they don't show us wtf is apparently going on with this Georgia sideline
LOL oh Harbaugh. What was wrong with his clipboard? I don't follow CFB super close.
first was sideline interference i think?
Hey, I'll take it.
Refs are territorial as fuck about their sideline tonight 
Lol @ sideline warnings 
Wait, sideline interference warning came after a sideline interference penalty? 
I just want to say that it wasn't their 2nd warning because a penalty was assessed after the first sideline violation
This stream is getting progressively worse as the game goes on.
Wait why is Hurts out of the game?  I must've missed the reason.
Bama 3 looked so confused after the pick.
I want this ball ran down Bamas throat. Waste the clock
DILLY DILLY
Pants guy is important, literally his whole job is to hold kirby.
That doesn''t make it not a penalty... 
Our best DB for sure.
Freshman mistake
GET OFF THE SIDELINE FFS GEORGIA 
Refs starting to take over
WE WANT JALEN 
Wheres the pants tugging guy now? Hes not keeping Kirby off the sidelines.
WTF is this sideline shit?  I've never seen this before.
I'm starting to think maybe the Georgia players aren't staying very disciplined on the sideline.
Because that's all he did. Sometimes you have to let them hang. 
Lol that's why we're winning right
NO TOUCHING!!!  Basically these refs right now with the UGA sideline. 
It's funny how this thread explodes in anger over that flag, but the 6 coaches in the coaches film room are like "yep, that's a flag"
Is Sam Ehlinger playing QB for Bama now?
Hahaha what the fuck was that pass, 3 dudes trying to set a screen. 
THEM DAWGS IS HELL DONT THEY!
............ OWheel that fell off from Bama.
Yep after the super bowl i'm still nervous as fuck why can't i be normal 
Georgia's sideline is going to fuck this up for them. They need to chill. 
Comment warning!!
That's our B1G Officiating for ya, Sparty bro! ;)
they pulled him for his throwing skills 
Pulled him for a freshman.
They hired the same people that did that Geostorm movie most likely
LIAM NEESONS IS MY SHIIIT
I found the first comment!
This is the part where you say "yes I'm sure about that"!
Liam Neeson as Liam Neeson in “Liam Neeson”
“We didn''t have anything else to call on them. On Georgia”
Would Hurts have thrown that int?
Saban seppuku tonight?
What''s up with the UGA sidelines yo?
Touchdown here might be the dagger.
You can''t have 15 people run into the field 
It's not like Jalen was going to score
Georgia fans currently have raging erections, even the women.
Come on Georgia, step on their fucking throats
Now that we're at commercial, question for the Auburn fans. Whose sideline would you rather see get hit by a meteor first? Literally the worst week a 10 win team could have I think 
Let the fucking teams be happy jeeze
If Alabama won this i honestly think Saban is proven to be the GOAT 
Fucking hell.
Fire that official
Kirby Smart has lost control of Georgia.
Well, they keep stepping into the field.
Don't worry, I see you
Dude, just get rid of the ball...QB was running a different play than the receivers, and the offensive line was running a different play than everybody else. Sheesh
JALEN HURTS AND TUA ARE BEING PROCESSED!Who's the 5 star third string QB that Saban has hired?
What''s the deal with these penalties? 
[deleted]
CORONA IS NOT A GOOD BEER IN MY OPINION @ ME
Did Jalen get injured? Missed the first half of the 3rd
Bama shouldn't be here
One was during a live play and one was after?
And if you looked at UGA''s first TD, Saban is 3 yards in the field. 
Got benched for a Freshman. 
What a legend, never forget 
I'm just here for the prequel memes
Alabama is ass, my dude 
Does anyone actually put lime in Corona
I think they put him in because their starting left tackle is out and Hurts is right handed and the freshman is a leftie. That said, the freshman did just throw a pick so yea I''d say he''s regretting the gamble. 
Usually getting in the way of a ref running down the sideline. The first few yards off the sideline is their space. Supposed to stay out of it
Henry Ruggs 
Does that make it out of bounds?  I'm not sure what the rule there is
That doesn't change the fact the flag was thrown during the play. 
Had a complete brain fart there, oops I'm keeping it up anyway 
looking for a stream, any suggestions? 
Where's that guy that holds on to Kirby?!
He threw the flag while Kirby was trying to get the guys back. It was a dead ball after a huge play. Fuck these refs.
Should have left Hurts in and had faith. 
I've decided that I'm ok with Tua T... yeah not trying to spell that... for now
Damn, I wanted a closer game. 
You get a call to your parents. 
Instructions unclear, dick stuck in a Fresh can
And now he looks like an idiot. Go dawgs!
Fuck! Don't you hate when that happens?
SWITCH TO THE 3RD STRINGER
That was a horrible decision 
Roooooolllll Taaaaaard 
Yep and limit an inexperienced QB to few options.
Fuck off refs
yeah get fucked double jesus guy
Yea, he'll learn to be better with the ball given a few more years. He has potential though, he'll be fine.
I love us too
Welcome to movies 
Your boys foot touched the sideline lol. They could''ve called off the TD.
With hurts at QB it''s 20-0
It's weird because I never saw a replay, but that's definitely what I think happened. 
fuck off let them celebrate
There is no way saban can win now ^^^^right?
Saban''s gonna put the pads on and do this shit himself on the next series
Fucking B1G refs
"Nooooo!!!!"
YOU LITERALLY HAVE ONE JOB, GET BACK COACH.
Holy shit refs. Fuck off
Why doesn't Bama run
You also could just stay on your sideline. It is a rule after all
Different penalties 
The mans only thrown one interception all year. 
The Big Ten dosen't allow fun.
no? Georgia literally went all over the field fuck off with this anti bama shit all the time i thought Iowa and Alabama were cool cause fuck tOSU
Always keepin it classier than the state of Alabama 
you can't put Hurts back in. tongatime is your boy to the end of this game
Does UGA have a turnover chain type thing?
I said it last year - Hurts is not a good QB, all he can do is run the ball.
Man Georgia is stomping Bama just like Auburn did.
Honestly, not a bad play by Tua. Needs to put more air on it to get it out of bounds, but that would've been a fine throwaway if that Georgia defender didn't play it so perfectly
Stop it. 
lol what
A touchdown here will shit on Bama's coffin. Go Dawgs. Fuck Alabama. 
Put in Brett Favre
It's like Remember the Titans out there. They throw a flag against Georgia every down.  
You see that bitch ass official throw his flag? Seriously. The coach was pushing them back. 
Damn Saban is going to be persecuted for the QB change 
Did you forget which state the bulldogs play for?
Pulled him. Wasn't making plays.
It feeds the dog. 
I''ll allow that one. Half the team went on the field lol
"muh sideline!!!!!!!!!!!!!!" \- That Ref
How can yOU of all people say that??
Thank you hated rival bro  *vomits violently as well*
The matchup we needed
Everyone knows the best time for a QB controversy is in the fucking national championship 
Weird play. Bama reciever had the ball if he just turned around.
THEY DOOOOO
In terms of playcalling, yes. But from a player/endurance perspective, running wears-out the d-line and passing wears-out the o-line.When you're passing, the o-linemen have to rock back and fight back the defenders. It's like doing a bunch of squats, while the defenders get free reign. When you're running, the hogs can crash into the defense. While this is an equal matchup in theory, the hogs have way better core strength. So they can just wear-out the inferior core of the d-line.So, long story short, it is just to wear-out the D-Line. But I guess it won't matter in this game regardless.
Oh, right.
this stadium looks nice as fuck
Dang...  I wish I was watching this game with my bammer friends.
Welcome to the B1G. No celebrating, no fun. 
WE WANT JALEN 
If I'm a Bama fan I'd rather live with a few picks, than the nothing offense Hurts provides. 
Baker 1st round talent
Yup they weren''t even looking for the ball 
Purdue secretly taking over the movie industry.
These are B1G refs officiating Harbaugh all year. If he could keep it together so can Georgia. 
nah USC going for the W...oh nevermind sorry
Yea - announcers never talk about what the average viewer wants to know. It''s frustrating 
Anything else on the board here puts Georgia with the title.
Si
These refs are trash!!! Miss an easy false start and call fucking sideline interference! WTF
Don''t we need an official review of that sideline warning? 
close this thang out dawgs
Yes
Coach was in the way of the ref running down the sideline.
How'd you get your first "warning" after being penalized?
Still better than pac12 though. 
Taken 5?
That's a possibility...
Ok so whos bamas 3rd string QB
Yes, we know we have a sideline. Why do they keep telling us?! H8 FEEDS THE DAWG!!!
Seriously, how do you throw it in bounds when you are throwing it away on a designed run play?
Yep 
I do 
Damn you're butthurt.
The Law of Freshman QBs says that Jake Fromm now also has to throw an interception
UCF 2017 National Champs
great thing about this half: both offenses are making it hard for ESPN to run commercials
Yes.
Ive seen it in hoops a lot. This is the most animated sideline I've seen in football (for good reason of course).
THEM DAWGS IS HELL DON'T THEY
I mean, it hasn''t hurt them yet.
Wow, Georgia looks like they're actually going to pull this win off. Maybe it's just Atlanta teams that can't get it done?
So far I have twenty seven minutes of commercials boys
Same 
I pure straight hate you. But I am cheering for Georgia tonight.
Puts on tinfoil 
Why did the receivers think that was a run play / Why did we pass on a run play?
FUN POLICE
Nick Saban made the worst decision of his career benching Hurts. Like what in the absolute fuck? Who does that in the championship?? Oh yeah, somebody like Nick fucking Saban who thinks they are gods gift to the world. 
Elementary school prospect: big arm, run fast Bobby 
He''s fine 
God
Saban is panicking!!!!
When Triplett come to ncaa
Bama is about to go two straight years without a natty wtf
That was a complete and total mix-up on the playcall. All of Bama's WRs were blocking downfield. They thought it was a run.
Did they really have to expand this fucking Allstate commercial 
pulled
I'm typically not one to agree to that sort of conspiracy, but damn... you're not wrong
just type it normally, your delivery killed it
Stop getting infractions then
Tbf, it made sense last drive
Neither did you... /s
Yeah that was unfortunate 
Nah man. The "charm" of the human element is unmitigated frustration. That's it. No one looks back fondly remembering the time they got screwed out of an important game due to refs that are incapable of being impartial and are incapable of being perfect. The games not only will be more fair the minute we get rid of human reffing, but they will go by SO much faster. 
Lol the ref was walking right passed Kirby as he was yelling at his players/staff to step back and he still threw the flag right in his face
ESPN is going to get the refs to flag Georgia for a uniform violation any minute here. Getting desperate. 
So Georgia gets a penalty for coming on the field. They do it again and it's just a warning? 
One for while a play was happening one when there wasn''t a play happening. 
Yep. 
Dude, half the team is on the damn turf.
Yeah apparently a sideline infraction doesn't count as a sideline warning? What?
Still a lot of football to play
Yea you could see him catch himself and try to keep everyone back.  
Predetermined location, just so happens that Georgia got in.
Nah
There aren''t a lot of new rock bands that can sell out an arena to KIDS. All these bands still sell out most shows wherever they go, it''s just an older crowd. And I think you''re low balling it a little with 16 being the target audience. I''d be safe saying the audience is a mix of all ages. I love CBF just as much as my grandpa (19 to 78 years old) and I bet there''s people all between us. I guess we just have to agree to disagree on who the target audience SHOULD be with a halftime show, and not who actually watches it. Also just a little comment go check out “Slash with Myles Kennedy Sweet Child of Mine, live in Sydney.” Myles is an amazing fill in for Axl and can hit all the same notes (note the end “where do we go now” high notes). If they were to do GNR or just Slash with GNR songs I''m sure there''d be no problem with him doing the vocals, and more than like a very positive reaction from fans. 
This thread is going so fast that it doesn''t matter what you say.  No one will see it.
Is It too much to ask for ESPN to show us a replay of Georgia''s sidelines?Avoiding it twice now
We need a gif of the ref throwing the flag with the Georgia coach holding his team to the sideline. 
Looks like Bama will have to find an 11th grader to put in at QB now.
We''re just a mess on offense. Defense is gassed. This could be it. 
They had like 6 people on the field after the pick....
Pretty sure those predictions about another Georgian team have proven false.
Awww thanks
Apparently you motherfuckers don't know how serious we take our sidelines in the B1G 
Who says "4 weeks without the car" instead of "A month without the car"
Jalen would have thrown it OOB at least.
Are you serious? Okay they are looking for any excuse to throw a flag against us right now. 
Throwing a flag for sideline on an INT in the national championship?Wow.  Ridiculous. 
Yes
I'm confused, the commentators told me this was a QB duel and that Tua was a game changer?
Bama got some momentum, Georgia shot it down quickly. We'll see if they cash in on a turnover.
Still a 2 possession game unless Georgia scores another touchdown here. Never rule out Bama going full Patriots
Was that supposed to be a screen play or some sort of option run for the QB?
Yep. Really is nice
Guys... as soon as I found a stream Georgia picked off that pass. Not going to say it''s because of me buttttt
That guy who's apparent job it is to hold Smart's waist to keep him off the sideline is going to get fired.
I'm so giddy
What was the other one
He is so used to Jalen just running that he was blocking lol
that's what i've been waiting for, the extended edition of the "four weeks without the car" commercial.
Damn this kid was in an accident commercial a few months back. Needs to drive better :^)
Your flair has me both intrigued and disgusted. 
Good thing he waited till after this game I''d hate for him to have bought too big a table. Maybe he can fill the empty spot with all the salt you''re bringing to this thread. 
So Alabama played three real teams all year and got blown out by two of them.
Hey I just tuned in after long day at work. Why isn't Jalen playing? Poor play or injury?
Tua couldn't handle the pressure.  Not that I can blame him, them dawgs is hell.
What the hell is going on on the sideline, I''m not seeing anything
Was that not a designed run? Every wide receiver was blocking so it seems very odd that Tua even threw the ball. Maybe don't start a true freshmen for the first time in the natty. 
Georgia please win this, PLEASE!
LOL at the Bama receiver.
Dude has 21 yards passing. He sucks
Flair bro
Savage spikes
Streaming on the WatchESPN app
Kirby needs to let the team storm the field after the next touchdown 
Kirby kills Saban and takes his powerFUCK
Herbstreit said catch a break like Georgia wasn't in the lead.
Weedavenue
yes
Yes it's the only way to drink it
The refs: “sideline interference, 15 yards”Also the refs: “sideline interference, first warning”
Penalty against Georgia: making Alabama lose. 30 yard penalty and Fromm, Chubb, and Michele are ejected
Unless they make it into a commercial we''ll never see it
That's what I was wondering.  
Be careful, that might count as doxxing 
The two calls are separate things. I don't know why, but they are.
Does anyone actually drink corona? 
The refs have never seen players get this hype in the big 10 so they have no idea what to do 
Pulled for a freshman who can throw better than him. 
As a browns fan, I envy you
I don''t think they mentioned it at all this game but did you know Jake Fromm is also a true freshman?
That's what surprised me with the first penalty. At least they're making it clear and are going to be consistently calling things on the sideline 
True true
He's called a handler. 
yes
[Georgia Bulldogs](#f/georgia) is going to sit Alabama the fuck down!
Welp, it looks like Hurt will be back in soon.
Correct. Sideline interference is not sideline warning.
Hello there
Savage Pads
coming from UTk? LMAO
Periscope is always clutch
Calm down mate you''re up by two scores.
Actually accents it well
Only way to drink it
Is there another way to drink Corona? 
Currently living in ATL Scared the city might burn down tonight Dabo protect me 
They just wanna let ya know that it's there
*Badgers and Longhorns have been access bitching penalty, enforced during first possession of 2018*Joking, I agree, it's the fucking NC game. Let kids have fun. This isn't NFL. 
Stay classy Alabama
hey bb
Do you seriously think a 10 yard difference on a punt is a "HUGE break"?
Remember these guys are true freshmen.
Damn good dawgs
HATE FEEDS THE DAWGREFS HATING ONLY MAKES DAWG STRONGER
[deleted]
Fun.
Party pooper 
No idea. I'm guessing players/coaches getting too hyped and flirting over edge or doing power fists of joy in field of play
They ain't Georgia they don't have that depth
Lets not get too wild 
Benched coming out of half
of course we do you heathen
Bars
The of course the guy with no experience throws a pick. This is a huge fucking stain on Saban. 
B 1 G
Really? They could''ve called the TD back easily if it was actually “rigged”
Just got benched
Who just deuces a lime into a Corona without squeezing the juice in there first? Get the fuck out.
Damn. Do you leave him in or not? Alabama''s offense looked better than it has all night at first. 
Might just be me not having a dog in this fight (heh) but I'm not seeing the ref bias everyone else is
Did Hurts just get his job back?  It looks like UGA can just sit back in coverage and watch the picks start rolling in.
UGA have anything like Toomer's corner?
Ya
espn should make live stream with other analysts a permanent fixture during big games
benched
The Mexican place does
It only shows through the duckduckgo search engine. Google, Bing, and the Wikipedia page itself are still un-vandalized
bama could use a fat guy pick 6 right now
so fucking pumped, who is with me?
Like Hurtz was last year?
Ttfw Joey freshwater is the reason for your success 
“Bench Hurts”“Put Jalen In!”
Methinks Saban's game plan has been less than stellar. 
Lol that bama dude was packin heat right before the break standing in the front wtf.
When the coaches and players come out too far towards the field and get in the way of the ref.
sophisticated rednecks
Aaaand freshman confirmed. 
Someone needs to merge "The Commuter" trailer with "The 15:17 to Paris" trailer and post it to Youtube.  No one will have any idea who to root for.
boi I sure do like watching the game in stop motion with missing bits here and there, thanks WatchESPN
Pulled him for a freshmen. They should of done this during the Auburn game to give him more experience.
Not even with Mexican food. 
Rip Tua Hype : 3rd quarter-3rd quarter
I can already see the headline:"After losing two consecutive championships, does Bama have a Nick Saban problem?"
Jake Fromm is a future franchise QB. Don't @me. 
Keep the commercials rolling I can't watch this anymore. 
pulled for a freshman. He looked fantastic the first drive, though. 
Maybe someone is physically impeding them
A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one
/r/cfbstreams
Rise Up
Life is good, brother
Bama bout to get stomped by Georgia?
Wasn''t doing anything
Refs seem awfully quick to throw these sideline flags now.
What''s going on on the sideline?
I got a truck load of salt, who needs some? 
Its when the players and coaches keep getting on the field or too close and the refs keep tellin them to back up (they need room to run on side lines + you can't interfere with plays that are on the edges like that).There are boxes/lines where teh coaches and players are allowed to stand and its about 1.5 yards from the actual side line and ends at the 20 on both ends of the field (usually). If you don't follow that you can get a flag. 
The Mike Leach approach
So slow UCF beat them to the Natty by like 2 weeks. Gonna be funny when they realize there''s no trophy for the presentation after the game...
its UGA Vs. Bama and the refs. 
He da best. We have the best strength coaches
No he just sucks
I'm going to need to put a lot more than lime in there after this shit 
Did a coach step on the field? I''m afraid I''m not exactly sure what sideline interference entails 
Hate to say it, but since I tweeted espn, the app has been working great. 
Haha. That's all I could think about when they threw the second one
Yeah, that was weird
Great action movies come in pairs. Volcano and Dantes Peak, Deep Impact and Armageddon. 
Site of championship was determined before the season. Georgia just got lucky with that 
Tuned in late what happened to bamas starting qb?
RIP Bama
Savage pads
...Yes?
Not anymore
How tf can we get a penalty for side line infraction, then afterwards get called for a "first warning"?? 
Please.  Its obvious he's over the hill.
I wanted to let you know that I saw this.
What are you talking about the Titans are about to beat them
What's the other one? 
DOES HURTS COME BACK!? WILL TUA TRANSFER TO OREGON? FIND OUT NEXT TIME ON CFB SUPER!
No matter who wins, those watching via watchespn lose. If this is how Disney does its Netflix competitor, not a good sign.
So, 3rd QB incoming?
This NBA promo is so creative. I wish CFB could be this creative in their marketing. 
That would make sense. Thank you!
Is the Live refresh on mobile crashing the app for anyone else?
So I'm late to the party. Why is Hurts on the sideline?
Mel Tucker being the DC on a elite college football team is crazy to me, he was the coordinator for one of the worst NFL defenses ever on the Bears.  Gave up 50 points in back to back games once. lol
The refs have been looking for bullshit for the past 2 drives. 
Got to keep the game interesting ESPN needs to get their viewer numbers up
Imagine life for an Auburn fan.
As a Falcons fan I''m gonna have to say nah 
THEM DAWGS IS HELL DON'T THEY
I missed it--why was the sideline warning given?
He does not know the way
NO, PUT IN GREG MCELROY. HE HASN'T LOST A GAME SINCE HIGH SCHOOL.
lol South Carolina's is 
r/cfbstreams
Why would big 10 refs care if Bama is losing?
Only way it''s drinkable
I don''t disagree. I just think those two calls would get talked about regardless of what happens if Alabama wins. Swing the momentum of the game in a huge way, and we''re a 14 point gift . 
Bama has it too. It's their S&C Coach, they're Saban and Smart's get-back guys
A FORTNIGHT WITHOUT THE VEHICLE!
Because they never got the first warning. The first one was an interference call since it was during a live play
Definitely seemed like a designed run or screen play. All of those wr''s were blocking. 
go knock on wood, headbutt a walnut table or some shit.  Don't ruin this
Now he looks like an idiot. 
Alabama about to lose
**GEORGIA PLS**    
**I'll take my true freshman over your true freshman.**
I honestly really related to that allstate commerical
Alabama is pathetic
A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one.
Look harderReddit is your friend.
Is he playing in this game?
This Friday, see Liam Neeson in "Taken, but on a plane, but this time on a train"
Go Dawgs. Never thought I''d say that 
We dawgz den?
In the feels, man.
Yes
SOMEONE GIF THAT FLAG BEING THROWN 
Here's my take on that last int. Uga is happy, bama not so much. 
I LIKE DRIVING IN MY TRUCK
Bitch you thought
Right here!
The 15:17 to Paris
“Salt” says the FSU fan making fun of a kids hairline. 
Is this what happens when Alabama plays a real team?
Alabama is up to something...
Nope. Tua4life.  Freshman will make mistakes.  Dude's only played 17 minutes, lol.
Shenanigans
BEER IS GOODYOUR STATEMENT CONFLICTS WITH THE ABOVE
Brainfart oops lol 
That didn't last long
With that sideline warning I'm starting to suspect these refs are parking enforcers for their day job.
So much whining about Georgia's sideline flags but for real, Kirby has been fighting off his sideline minder like the whole damn game. I really like Kirby's enthusiasm though
Bama fans
We got spikepads my boy
I''m here! Very disappointed but here
 I DID NOT THROW IT. IT'S BULLSHIT I DID NOT THROW IT! I DID NAWT.
When will people on this website understand that officials don't just arbitrarily assign penalties to either side? It is possible that a team commits an infraction.
Right here my dude 
We can loan you our keep back guys if you need them to keep you off the field. 
A Bama loss is bad for memes.....  But I want Bama to lose....  
Can't even blame the QB here, he stepped up like a fucking man and made a very understandable mistake. Dude deserves some props regardless
The Savage pads
They finally call flags...on our sideline!
doing a good job so far
Bench the guy that got you here?  Never.
Except for that leaky roof
Yes! Liam Neesons movie!
Worth the wait, for sure
Jalen isn't a great passer, but he doesn't make bad decisions.
Can confirm
Alot to be said for experience 
Nope, just the coconut, and then I drink it all up.
My old high school football coach made his team pick the team who wins this game. If your pick win, no running for the rest of this week. Lose, double running. I feel sorry for the people who picked bama
Saban: out-coached
Bama bout to get stomped by Georgia
Tua gunna get DFA.
Nope
Dear lord... please allow this dangerous combination of hair spary, bat slobber, and D.O.T. four automatic transmission fluid to excite my mind, occupy my spirits, and enrage my body, provoking me to kick any man or woman in the back of the head regardless of what he or she has or has not done unto me.
Nobody except bama fans want bama to win
At first I was like wow that's great composure from a freshman to throw it away there.  Then the ESPN is so shitty I couldn't see where the ball went and I said no.  Then it was intercepted and I said yes.
Saban: "Hey ref... i'm going to do something crazy like start a freshman QB in the second half... I'm probably going to need a few extra yards..."Ref: "Say no more, fam"
https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/sec-rule-changes-coaches-who-argue-on-field-players-who-run-and-leap-risk-penalty/
< throw interception to remind people you''re backup
< Third drive throw a pick on a pass you should''ve thrown out of bounds
in fairness, he looks freakish good for a frosh QB. Dude has like a 100 yard arm. 
He sucks 
Got benched.
[Twin films](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_films) are common.
Yeah, shines a highlight on how we have the fast, shifty, break loose RBs, but damn it UGA still nabs all the Chubbs and shit. Why, why, do they get 2 5*RBs every year. Pet theory is, those RBs know they'll get run down elsewhere, at UGA, they'll have a year or two to showcase and go on. Versus getting the load for 3 or more years elsewhere. 
Refs tryna get the Bama betters their money back
At half yeah
Saban pulled him 
Yes, to cover up the taste when it''s your only option
Just when I thought the halftime show showed how old and white this sub was!
You''d think it''s been a long time since they have played for a National Championship or something...
Seen that commercial dozens of time never even noticed that, but yea that''s weird.
I think after the pick, a few players ran onto the field, maybe interfering with the refs line of sight to the play.
Prefect execution
Uhhhhh tell that to UGA?
Still...That dude is going to be scary 
I spoke too soon, maybe. Risk/reward I guess
Am I the only one that feels like this is a skillful troll job?
so refs miss the big calls on both sides but throwing the flag on small stuff , i guess they want to be in the game 
The one time I want Bama to win a championship, they let me down.
Doesn''t matter, it didn''t impact the play, which is why the penalty was added to the kickoff.
Oodell Beckham?

 Thanks
I [called](https://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/7p48fo/game_thread_cfp_ncg_georgia_vs_alabama_8pm_et/dsefmx0/) it before it happen lol 
This crew is so B1G
I see u dawg 
Gonna assume the true freshman who''s never played a meaningful snap before this half was a big part in that
Hype
Nothing. Saban just changed it up
He trash
Naw
Kirby needs a leash backpack. Or something
4 weeks is more specific imo. When I have kids, I'll say 4 weeks. Probably. The fuck do I know. 
Fuck I''m still so salty. 
Penalty was for encroachment during a live play. The warning is for one after the play is dead.
Benched.
He's Hurt
Dont underestimate the georgia sports curse.
so strange
 I'm just sitting here thinking over and over if they can hold Baker Mayfield they can hold some freshmen.
That guy in red
Lol, surprised they didn''t flag for illegal lineman downfield to negate the INT
ROLL DAWGS
benched 
so are the refs
Ew don't steal "We dem boyz"...but yeah I agree. Fuck Bama.
Cause he''s doody
Safe to say that interception definitely... **HURTS**
The main ESPN stream was freezing every 10 seconds so I decided to switch to the Georgia radio stream, great decision so far.
Silver lining.  These commercial breaks make it to where I never miss a play because these drinks are going right through me
I get that we all hate the refs but why is everyone mad about this? He''s gotta stay off the field.

This kills the Saban.
He was bad and got benched
Summary: National Championship confirms what we already knew regarding who the best team in the SEC is.
Looked like Tua thought it was a pass play. All the receivers were blocking down field. Seemed like a design run.
Fuckin blows my mind. No way would 19 year old me be able to handle this pressure. 
Got pulled because he's ass and can't throw
NO MORAL VICTORIES
It''s leaking.
Bama went into panic mode and now paying for it
Suddenly relevant
But it isn't bama doing it bro. Unacceptable....
Didn''t see the first one, but coaches and players can''t come off the sideline. That warning was deserved
I guess. We know who the real winner is go enjoy it 
Shit, I'd watch it. 
Who? Not the quarterbacks, surely.
Fun is not allowed 
Lol. :'(
Steroids
Benched
Drinking
Dude that's SEC!
"No touchie" the refs probably
I think everyone was waiting to see if he would make a freshman mistake. You can't replicate an NC Game or a defense of this caliber during garbage time in the season.He seems to have the moxie to bounce back from this though. Bama needs to hold Georgia to an FG attempt obviously, but still plenty of time with the deep shots Tua is pulling the trigger on.
Saban being exposed for the fraud coach he is, he just gets lucky riding the Bama name to score recruits and sets up a cupcake schedules every year
ITS THERE FOR A REASON 
B1G
wait--WHO???
Because on the TD it impeded a ref running down the field. The interception happened after the play was over. 
Nah, Saban benched him. Apparently, Nick has had his fill of college national championships 
All 3 of those WR's were blocking. They are used to a QB who runs there, instead of a passing QB.edit: Herbstreit be reading reddit boys.
Had to crack down on Harbaugh sideline antics somehow
*inconcievable*
Mind blown.  You're right.
burn it down with them my friend
I see you
I see you!  Go Dawgs!
Double jeopardy 
Don''t worry, no one else is going to say that either. 
Odds we see the 3rd strong true high school Senior qb for Bama next drive? 
Talk about the wheels coming off. 
in saban's shit house
He got benched. 
Not talking about Jalen, he doesn''t throw the ball
You seriously can't say things aren't starting to look one sided
For what? 
WAS playing well
SABAN TO CLEVELAND CONFIRMED
How do they get a warning now, but the interference happened earlier.
Fuck these refs, looking for any excuse to screw Georgia.
UGA is gonna have to pull a Dirty Bird to lose this game now. Alabama doesn't have Tom Brady, so I'm not sure how the outcome is gonna change at this point.
4 weeks is less than a month. 
Maybe they assess penalties in weeks, and it keeps things nice and even?
He was shit
got benched 
The 15:17 to Paris
"Sideline Warning on Georgia, for being lit as fuck. This is their first lit as fuck warning." 
There''s no way that fake greeting card company has 400 employees.
We want bama ... buried 6ft under.
These refs deserve to burn alive. They are bought and paid for. They are trying to invent ways to take away UGA's momentum. 
Hot take
Pretty accurate
I saw it. 
Benched for being generally awful. 
He's not CFP caliber
Does he? 
The refs called an incredibly good first half. I was thinking at halftime how refreshing it was that there was no controversy and we didn't see too much of the refs in a big game. And then in this quarter it's just gone to shit. Should have known it was too good to be true.
These big 10 refs trynna take the fun out of the game. 
Only skin I have in the game are the refs and they re doing fantastic. 
Less ambiguity.  A month could mean 4 weeks, or it could mean *next month*.
Plz let the dynasty come to an end
Benched at halftime
The kid looks like he's high in that "accident forgiveness" commercial.
Georgia making Bama look bad. Reminds me of 2014
This is news to me lol
Supposed to warn them first and they fucked up, so they warned them after the first penalty 
Tua "Rex Grossman" Tagovailoa
Lol
Saban bout to put Hurts back in
Poor play
is it just me or was that a terrible decision of a pass by a freshman qb. the out of bounds looked way safer than throwing right into traffic. when all your receivers aren't even expecting a ball being thrown their way...
Yes.No.
Pulled at halftime due to bad passing in the first half.
He couldn't do his job so he got sidelined
We're near dead last in penalties called "in favor" of.  Move along.
They pulled him for Tua
I made a joke you sweet cantaloupe :) 
Probably need to fire that Saban guy. Looking at these past two seasons, he always seems to lose his last game. Probably indicative of a bad coach
Well they have looked a bit washed up tonight.
*H8 Intensifies*
That's the first time I've seen that version of that commercial.
Only the women
I think it's an actual penalty after the warning.
I drive A Prius while eating tofu 
I dunno, I'd love to be part of it
Yeah they're payroll is on the line lmao 
Yeah but I'm a Falcons fan and a Bama fan. That cancels out the Georgia curse.

Saban about to play QB roulette 
Dear Tua:Sit down. Be humble. 
Removing jalen was the first step.Now we must remove the entire starting defense.Anyone in here from ATL? They need freshman.
The official at the line of scrimmage ran into a UGA personnel in the white area about the time the UGA player was tiptoeing the sideline 60 yards away.
Are we really going to keep saying this even after stomping Clemson lmao
Wasn't he the number 2 dual threat QB in the counry?
In the replay it looked like any other game after a big play resulting in change of possession.  They were quickly wrangled back, but the ref wasn't having it.  
Take solace in the karma.
Fromm is going #1 in 2020.
Kirby Smart: “**HOLD THE LINE!!**”
Beginning of the half. 
Fuckery mostly.
This.  At least we have hope now
Was just talking to a friend about this. hella frustrating.
Momentum status: re-flipped
I think Auburn could beat both these teams.  But not UCF.
Or, the team they are playing against is good
Someone explain sideline infraction vs sideline warning please. What happens if they get more? Do they go on probation? 
Dear Nick Saban clearly you have problems closing things out at Bama please come to Utah love u bby i'll make you cookies
Love the Bammer salt
I can't tell if that "basketball battle" commercial is supposed to be HD on the stream.
Away from play
Seriously 
Why did he take out Hurts?
Saban pulled him cause he was playing like Brock the Lobster
He was ritually sacrifed over half time. 
Thanks Harvard
And you guys got blown out by Iowa?
Lol a lot can change in 5 minutes
It's what makes it bearable 
[deleted]
He just has a hard time finishing, he is getting old after all.
[deleted]
Gotta keep Tua in. Hurts will protect the ball better but he doesn''t give you a chance to win 
They didn''t say how he would change the game
THICC BOI!
Yes, then Tua just forced an awful throw for an int
Saban looking for a local high school kid for 4th Q now lol
Them dawgs is hell.
Wasn't playing well as a passer so they switched at half time
Saban pulled him 
AFAIK this IS the rule in basketball but I'm not sure. As someone who is not a football rules expert I get where he's coming from. Then again, this is his job sooo...
Turns out football is not fun to watch when your team is losing. Who woulda thought 
Lol the angle of Kirby jumping out onto the field joyfully, followed by trying to get everybody back off the field and the ref just casually walks by and throws the flag is golden
It's not over til the clock hits 0 as far as I'm concerned
Wut? No? No coach has ever said they would “live with a few picks” for fuck sake 
Maybe but I doubt it. That one seemed to come after the play when the sideline was just celebrating 
It's honestly not Tua or Jalen. Bama's entire offense is pretty mediocre. They abandoned the run sorta early and they just have nothing in terms of receivers. Ridley has two drops on passes he should have caught which is two to many in the natty for a guy who's supposed to be one of the best in the nation. The offense just isn't very good. Not fast enough and not strong enough. They can't outrun Georgia and they can't bully them. There's just no answer for them regardless who they put under center 
I'd just like to point out that in the last /r/cfb poll, I voted Georgia as my number one.
I can't wait to see the montage of stunned Bama fans as Herbstreit and the entire ESPN machine try to rationalize what's happening. 
The Dawgs D might be a bit Tua much for Alabama. 
Never understood how hurts is bamas qb, hes trash
BAMA GOT 'EM RIGHT WHERE THEY WANT 'EM PAWWWWL
Benched him for second string. Second string led us to the touchdown
Yeah and the Badgers still kicked your ass
that's a nice land you have there...
Fuck Nick Saban. Idiotic coaching move benching Hurts
Pulled due to underperformance
Sup bae
Violation of the No Fun Rule 
No clue, sure wish the commentators would tell me.
They literally fucking blocked on a run play, Hurts has ruined there minds
Somebody needs to get a leash on Kirby
Switch to homer. Its working fine on my fire tv
I''m glad he put Tua in. We had no shot with Hurts. 
Everybody was blocking. It makes me think the QB was the one out of the loop on the play
Benched 
Whenever possible though I won't go entirely out of my way to get limes if I don't have them.
That''s the rule in basketball, but I don''t know if it translates 100%
Wizard status
Best performance under pressure? Cardale Jones, pressed into service due to injury and won his first 3 games: B1G championship game, CFP Semi-Final (against Bama no less), and then beating Heisman winner Mariota in the championship game.
That was to do with a player trying to possess/touch the ball. Not the player.
You can take O'Korn if you'd like. 
So I might have cursed Tua with my earlier comment. Who should I curse next?
Midwest civility, doncha know
bless ur soul
Tangovailoa.
Lmfao bama so trash
Inb4 kirby made saban comments
But that means Richt in a big game. Not so sure on that.
Wonder which QB comes out next time
He couldn''t do anything. Bama made a change. 
Yeah, like maybe someone accidentally mowed his yard an inch too low, and he's out for payback.
Mouths... everybody is fucking blockingHaha
"This isn't even my final form!" - Nick Saban
Rob Schneider 
Right with you!!!
play
Alabama knows how to behave on the sidelines
Would it be enough of an adjustment to throw the offense off their game? Guys have to think a little harder about plays that they've practiced, makes things not run as smoothly.Never played so Im curious how big a deal it would be.
So, very?
Do a three way and add murder on the orient express
Field and Stream is a classic. Great information. Little light on fly fishing.  Upstream Color is the great follow up to Primer. Shane Curruth really showing his creativity. 
he had 90 yards of offense at half so we got benched
Because of the score
Let's not get ahead of ourselves. 
Y''all are missing out if you''re not watching the ESPN megacast
I think this one was a warning because it was the offense coming on the field, like they are supposed to do, but before the play was over. Just a guess though
And you watch way too much TV. 
I do when I get corona at a bar
Out of bounds.
Saban has Georgia right where he wants them.
Ooh, a red card.
Looked like maybe Tua thought he still had the option to pass and he didn't really.
Myles Brennan should have been in that discussion this year.  They were all in Elite 11 together. 
That's that Nick Sabah championship composure lol 
Not anymore
Thanks
"Everybody's fucking blocking."
Not all of us.
Ergo Wisconsin would hav yet better than Miami?
This is why you don't put in a freshman QB at this point haha. Oh well. He did good though. 
Benched for playing like Jalen Hurts.
Not sure what this logic is...
I upvoted hehe
Crimson Tide ate Tide Pods before the game.
That's the reason Kirby wanted Scott Cochran to come to UGA with him... only man that can keep him on the sideline.  
"Everybody is fucking blocking"
Sad Saban 
Sideline interference and sideline infraction are two different penalties. One is during the play someone interferes with a ref and is an auto penalty.Edit: Missed a few words.
So I can say I hate that the new LT we have is a BYU grad and no one will see it.
I saw this.
LOL Wut?
He's a true sophomore playing in his second title game and is 2nd all time in TDs in Alabama history.
"everyone is fucking blocking"
But Saban in at QB
[turnover pads](https://s3media.247sports.com/Uploads/Assets/841/623/7623841.jpg)
Saban is about to sad panda
And now I know how delayed my stream is.
No but he wouldn''t have marched down the field the last possession either.
What? That was a terrible throw. It wasn''t a throwaway. He was trying to force it to Ridley. 
That''s typically the call, there''s an box they have to stay in and can''t step on the white, I''m sure there are other reasons to call it, but I''m not sure what happened on the field, as it wasn''t shown on ESPN 
Oh my, this ain't good.
Spiked shoulder pads like the Road Warriors
Checks flairThis gone b good 
Sucked 1st half, so he's getting to sit on the bench and think about his life for a bit.
“Everyone''s fucking blocking” Hahahaha
I totally was thinking that and didn''t want anyone to think I''m special :(
Turnover pads!!
Saban to the Dawgs confirmed
Got pulled after first half.
Jalen is playing badly
Poor play in the first half I'm guessing even though he rushed for most of Bama's yards
Hey guy, I like your opinion
THIS FUCKING GAME
I'd rather have my player fly too close to the sun than do jack shit for half a game. Say what you want about "this is why true freshman don't belong" but it's 20-7 and not 20-0. 
I kind of want to see Hurts come back and lead an epic comeback now.  And then immediately announce he is transferring to FAU to join Kiffin.
> Everyone is f*cking blocking. 
Geez, is Saban conceding already? This doesn't seem like him.
who is dudeman on the Bama sideline in a Christmas sweater? 
no way
NOT SO FAST 
Price you pay for putting in a guy with less snaps than I have fingers. That being said, that kid looks like he''s better than Hurts in almost every way. He throws that ball like a crazy person
The refs want Kirby to stay behind the white.  Interference gets called if the sideline official makes contact with the staff while running the sideline
But seriously, who the fuck was he throwing to
Nebraska football...
Because there wasn''t any dpi, receivers were literally trying to block
Holy shit
Holy shit lol
I think some of the espn streams you don''t need a log in for 
Take me back :(
Poor play. It''s the only real Saban shenanigan so far
Who is Bama''s 3rd string QB? 
[Liam Neeson retires from action films](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/sep/13/liam-neeson-retires-from-action-taken-film-actor)Well, that didn''t last long. 
Lol, kirby smart backed every fucking player off the sideline
Played poorly in the first half so they started the backup at the start of the 3rd
Oh my Georgia lol
Lmao
no fucking way
Wow
Lmao
Can pretty well guarantee the wrs knew the play, it was your QB that didnt
Sideline too hype I guess lol
Kirby jumped like 1 inch onto the field in excitement
I did the same. Same result. 
Fuck that guy
lol I wasn't the one who downvoted you but I don't have an explanation for shit you just made up. I never heard anything that wasn't a backing track or him with the mic to his mouth. Go watch the CMT awards if you don't like hip hop grandpa. 
FFS
"Everybody's fucking blocking"
Hey, with all these commercials, I might be able to make it home and catch the 4th. 
OH MY GOD NOOOOOOO
poopie butts
I love True Freshman
BIG MEN MAKING MOVES
It was an epic journey. There were highs and lows, love and loss. I'll remember these minutes fondly
Woooooooooo
Fucking hell
Fuck
Well this just happened.
Despite Kirby being one of the most emotive coaches I''ve seen, there hasn''t been a sideline call all year - what is this shit?? 
HELL YES!!!!!!!!!!
There is always one Sith lord and one Sith apprentice.
Quit taking the comment so seriously and watch the game. It''s a joke, the kid has a 7 head, your backup is (was) balling. 
FUCK
Hahahaha lol
Welp.
Wow
lmaoooooo
Welp
Watching the coaches film room at commercials...my wife said, "Is mullet coach drinking Dr. Thunder?"
Hey u called it
I think interference and sideline warnings are different? Like interference is during a play, and warnings are after plays? Not sure though.

Everyone's fucking blocking-Nick Saban
#INTERCEPTION BACK
Hehehehe
lol
It was way back around the 50 when the player was running to the end zone. I'm watching the coaches one. They were saying how Petty that penalty was because the ref was WAY behind the play. 
B1G
You must have missed back-to-back fumbled snaps in the Iron Bowl.
Ajit Pai
Poor play
That''s amazing, never knew that was a thing.
OHHH SHIT
You damn idiot
TAKE IT BACK
Welp
HOLY SHIT
Balls. 
Wow
I think the infraction may have been someone in the way of an official down the field out of shot. The warning was for the team just getting on to the field, but now interfering with anything
We''ve had one, yes. But what about second sideline penalty?
Lol.
What Te Fuc is happening 
Saban after the TD: Tua, u kno da wae10 minutes later: u do not kno da wae 
Big boi ballin
God damn it Jake.
THIS IS WILD
T H I C C INTERCEPTION
FUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Team that won conference better than team that didn'tEdit: sorry Georgia that pic was my fault
What fun
What the fuck.... 
sheeeeeeitttttttt
Fat boy running 
We have ringing the Chapel Bell. That Bell is going to ring for at least a week straight if we pull this off.
Hurts had done nothing all game. What else was Nick supposed to do?
Because i've seen them score a touchdown in double overtime to beat Oklahoma 
They were getting ready for prom last year.
FAT BOY PICK
Omfg... this game is getting wild 
Wtf
OH MAMA HERE COMES THAT MAN
LOL.  Oh dear.
oh fuck
Oh god.
what is happening 
OH NO BACK TO BACK INTERCEPTIONS
LOOOL FUCK ALL OF YOU SHITTING ON TUA
Again?
wut
LMFAAOOOOO 
Cutcliffe just brought up that the sideline could've been shit talking the refs all game. Then Fitzgerald brought up how the refs switch sides at halftime. So those could all be reasons the flag was thrown.
What the fuck Fromm
HAHA YES
OH MY FUCKING GOD ALABAMA IS SO FUCKING LUCKY JFC
Really?
God dammit
What is this game
BIG BOY INTERCEPTION
ugh
WHAT THE FUCKKK THIS GAME IS WILD 
Saban benched him cuz he wanted to be able to pass the ball.
We would, if we could. 
Lol
The magical golden shoulder pads of dildo
I'm gonna ring the chapel bell all night 
What is this game?  Jayzus
Eye for an eye. Pick for a pick

Lets see if Bama gets a sideline warning too
LMAO
How?
-_-
Ahhhahaha what the hell
LOL WHAT!?!?!
BRUH
It always stops right as the play begins! I'm watching the change in downs/yards more than anything! 
Pretty sure a football team from Georgia thought so too last year. 
Benched
HAHAH oh shit 
I blame Miami for all this turnover bling.
HAHAHAHA WHAT the fuck
BIG MAN INT
Well hole lee fuck
Interception ball
BIG BOI
BIG BOI PICK
Fuckin hell
BIG BOY BIG BOY
I''m want Liam Neeson on a blimp with a hostage situation. Just Liam trying to find one guy threatening to light a match. I''d watch that.
to eithera) brag to all your coworkers about the big win, orb) look like a shell of yourself following the game
what about now

OH MY GOD!!!!
BIG MAN INTERCEPTION
YOU GET A TURNOVER, EVERYONE GETS A TURNOVER
Georgia 
You should be nervous, there is so much time left 
he sucks
Probably makes more in college though. That's the benefit of free labor. 
ITS OVER BAMMMERRRRS!!!   
What the actual fuck?
Lol, fucking what
HAHAHA
I can't
This fucking game 
No fucking way 
Holy shit this game 
.... oh.
So if they''re all blocking like it''s a run, it''s a miscommunication on the QB right?
Tom Brady
Again?
His running was the only way they produced yardage in the first half, so no one knew why he was benched. But then Tua took it downfield and scored in a nasty drive. But then he just threw a pick like a true freshman.  And as I type this Fromm throws an INT lol
There's going to be a broken Chapel Bell if we win tonight
Shit. 
Insanity. Just fucking insanity. 
GODDAMN THIS FUCKING GAME
College football is a silly sport.
Well that was crazy
Not what you needed to do there Fromm
FUCK
what a twist
The counter counter interception!!!!! This game is great.
WTF GEORGIA
Clown fiesta
are you not supposed to eat them?
Oh god yes. Do you actually want to taste that beer?
Man, I really wish I had went with my gut and bet on Georgia in this game.Except I don't gamble and don't bet on anything. Gotta trust my gut bacteria more. Probiotics, yo.
You might saythe Tide has turned 
BIG BOYYYYYYYYYYY
Of fucking course 
Man
Oh wtf
HERE COMES BIG BOY
What the fuck was that from fromm lol
Jesus. 
2 plays, 2 INTS. Interesting 
This game..Wow
LOL
[This sub right now](https://i.imgur.com/A0dhKim.jpg)
They forgot because they made up the first one.
Lol they tell you from peewee on not to cross the sideline. I''m rooting for GA but you can''t just rush the field on every turnover
ummmm.....
wtf was that
MAH CHEST UGH
Good tackle fromm
Well shit.
DAMN YOU, REFS!
And just like that
What the actual fuck 
This fucking game. I love it
LOL THICC BOI 2.0
What is Saban thinking sending Tua on this early?
Where did that INT come Fromm?!
ughhhhhh
WHAT IS HAPPENING
I would so watch CFB Dragonball.
Taken: the train 
Oooohhhhh
Welp

Same guy that got it last week. 
wut
IT SEEMS RUMORS OF ALABAMAS DEMISE WERE GREATLY EXAGGERATED
Dammmmnnnn
Wtf is this game lol
God damn it
Lmao Fromm is not good 
Imagine is Bellichick took Brady out in the SB
HAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHA FAT MAN CATCH
Well then...
God's a Bama fan
Oh for fucks sake
Nah imagine.
“Interfered” with a ref, didn''t step on the field. If they got on the field and touched a player or affected the play it would be a live ball foul
He sucks and isn''t a quarterback. He''s another running back
Good question
Where is the sideline warning now?
Welp
And now I''m sad again! 
What the fucky McFuck is this fuck
Are you freaking kidding me?
AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA FUCK EM BOTH
bama needed that big time
Goddamn
This has to be prescripted 
Fat boy can run

Tua picks up a TD: SABAN IS A GENIUS, LET ME SUCK HIS COCK.                     Tua throws an INT: WTF, WHY DO YOU BENCH YOUR STARTING QB? SABAN IS AN IDIOT!                          -CFB.
This game is banana land
So does Hurts replace his phone background with a photo of him on the sideline for next year's motivation?
Man I love it when Linemen intercept, and waddle down the field. 
Where's Bama's sideline warning? They were celebrating too
SEC FOOTBALL
Put a tent on that circus.
For once the Georgia fan ref conspiracies seem sure as hell true. Like wtf is going on with these no calls and calls for minor sideline disruptions. That shit is never called.
Wth
Get in there big men
wat
FUCK FUCK FUCK THAT IS NOT WHAT WE NEEDED
The two trains are barreling towards each other on the same rail. Who will win? Liam Neeson or some American heroes?
Good call on that wishful thinking!
Damn if we didn't give it right back
BIG BOY RUMBLIN AND STUMBLIN

Where's the sideline warning on that shit?!
HOLY FUCKING SHIT YOU FUCKING WIZARD
The fuck?
Wow. Good call.
Jesus Georgia.
THIS IS A GREAT GAME
Well fuck
YIKES
Oh, this game still has plenty of surprises.
Well at least he got the tackle
What were people saying about freshmen qbs?
TRUE FRESHMAN MISTAKE
SUCK IT 
Golden spikes shoulder pads
explain
Gotta prep the kids for the No Fun League
Sideline Warning on the last play but basically it means people on the sideline are running on field or too close to the field of play during play. It''s something that rarely gets called. 
Oh yea Georgia got fucked twice by the refs then fucked themselves. 
Let's just trade INTs the rest of the game.
You take this*No, you*
At least Fromm got a nice tackle
Unsportsmanlike penalty on UGA, they''re way too happy right now. 
LMAO
What even is this world.
Hold my beer
EAT SHIT FROMM
Fromm out there bodying people
Big boys got game!
BIG MAN PICK
I'm rooting for UGA, but I wanted to see that big man score a TD
yoooooooooooooooooo
Where's Bama's sideline warning there, ref?
So if UGA holds on to win that means App gets the highest quality loss possible? 
Whattttttttt
Banch
That'd be hilarious 
this game is wild, damn

loooool this game is getting wild
Jake Fromm can tackle too? Dual threat. 
Welp
Okay wait, wtf
This didn't age well. 
I wouldn''t say he sucks. Bama isn''t known for their QBs but they''re good enough. Why bench a guy that''s been here before?
Saban confirmed voodoo magic 
Brb gotta hang myself 
this game is getting nutttttyyyy. no way bama doesn't score here lol.
Hand got hands
Bama really needed that.
Great tackle Fromm 
This. Fucking. Game. 
They were all blocking lollll
Now Bama is trying to win the game for the refs 
Buy yourself a goddamn lottery ticket
It was delayed
Freshman QBs everybody
NEEEEDED THAT!!!!!
Just SEC shit
Golden spikes ... nullified.

OOHH MYYY!

Wow!
GOD DANG IT STOP GIVING US HOPE

You sound like an Oklahoma fan

Does no one want to win?
Lmao what the actual hell I'd happening
Bring Kiffin back!
are you psychic

Maybe Alabama should try a QB that doesn't have blonde dyed hair
Georgia paying the pick forward
### WHAT IS GOING ON?!?!?!?!
It was just a pleasant exchange of balls.
[A quarter of this thread right now ](https://media1.tenor.com/images/0495c07192fb50cd0591cec12e0e6f52/tenor.gif?itemid=4680978)
Freshman-Like Interceptions:Georgia 1 - 1 Alabama
wowee
Nobody was looking. Tua what was that?
At 6,7. LmFao 
This game is LITIs that what the cool kids say?
Now does Tua gets benched? Hmmm tough call!!
Take the damn sack. Jesus, worse case we punt and they are at like the 20.
UGA.    do a few running plays.     Fromm isnt consistent. 
Good hustle and tackle by Fromm. Tough stuff
We've seen this before - Every Clemson fan
The helmet pick!
WHAT IS THIS 
Here's my take on that last int. Bama is happy, uga not so much.
RUFKM?
Lol
I'll never forget the time Saban got so shook he pulled his 25-2 starting QB in a National Title game.
What is happening? 
You can''t fake this stuff
BIG MAN INTERCEPTION. 
Holy fucking bonkers 
Dline INT umm yes please. 
This game is becoming really enjoyable.
Wild 3rd quarter. Back to back turnovers.
How the turn tables
Oh man, that angle they just showed us made Tua's pic look that much worse. No receivers were looking for that throw
Georgia TF you doin???
MOTHER FUCKER
This went from boring to fucking exciting 
Are we finally getting a game?
Dink 
FUCKKKKK!!!! Bama luck AGAIN.
Does anyone want to win this game lol
Alternate streams. Hometown radio call on ESPN3
I think Tua got used to popping it off and having it be caught. 
I'd like to say that Jalen Hurts will transfer to Florida Atlantic to play with Lane Kiffin again in the future. Just watch.
This game is getting crazy
RUMBLIN' STUMBLIN'
This is the only time I''ll ever say it but Go Dawgs.Fuck the Huskies anyway.
Dafuq?
I FUCKING LOVE CFB
One of you motherfuckers called it. Idk who, but you know 
I dont think there was much of an argument that clemson deserved to be there
It really wouldn't have, our offense if fucking trash with Kelly Bryant. 
OF COURSE 
WTF was Fromm thinking lettin that fly?
I said it. You should have ran the fucking ball. Just gave them life. It always amazes me the stupidity of play calling 
Well. Fuck. 
Wam Bam! What the fuck just happened?!
This is a rollercoaster
Football Gods give and take away 
Announcers desperately trying to avoid saying Piesman
Penalty, making a big play against Alabama, 15 yards. 
IT'S SCIENCE
Thanks
How did #99 even have the reflexes to notice that. holy goodness
I guess we're back on that Georgia Bullshit
Wow that's just terrible luck 
Pffffft
Oh, okay then.
un lucky bounce, ugh
THIS GAME 
One of you said they needed a big man pick 
off the helmet!  wtf
WEll that changed quickly
Oh dear god, this game.
clemson was boudn to clemson
SIDELINE WARNING! 
I love how no offensive PI when every Bama reciever is blocking 
This game has turned very true freshmany
*googles momentum swing**big boi interception top results*
The same thing that happens in every game, the refs are just being assholes.
No
Could've wrapped this game up, instead we get that throw. 
That's using your head!
#BIG BOI INTERCEPTION 
sideline warning bama? no? aight
Fromm: lemme just throw this off a helmet
JUST RUN THE BALL
Oh no georgia what is u doin
FROMM WAT IS U DOIN 
LET'S GO ANOTHER THICC PICC FOR BAMA
I mean. I believe it. 
Holy hell. This game is exciting. 
That's a freshman move there.
As a neutral.... Hell yes!  I wanna see a good game 
AHHHH
Not really Fromm''s fault. Bad luck.
The luck of Georgia sports 
What are the odds Saban throws 99 a touchdown pass like last Monday?? 
HOLY SHIT BOYSSSS AND GIRLLSLLSSLSLSL
At least we'll always have shitposts
Can you just curse every single Alabama player?Oh and maybe add in a little bit of a&m just for me 
Have you guys ever heard of Baker Mayfield? 
Talk about a turn of the TIDESHah! Get it? I'll go now.
Lmao this is insane
Guys.... Lets not forget UCF are the real champions. For real.
Poor play in the first half.  He looked like he was confused what the QBs job is.
Key to the game: Shane Beamer 
He caught that with his back to the ball!
That catch was insane!!!!!!!!!
Better to be lucky than good.Off the helmet are u serious
We''ll take that right back thank you very much
NCAA 2005 Update: I scored a fuck you TD + 2 pt. to end my clock killing drive with 4 seconds left. My #1 Gators win 27-0 over formerly #14 LSU. Next game coming soonFinal stats:Offense* 277 total yards, (94 passing, 183 rushing)* 14:24 TOP (out of 20:00 total)* 15 first downs* 0 turnoversDefense* 59 total yards allowed (44 passing, 15 rushing)* 2 sacks* 3 first downs allowed* 1 turnover (recovered muffed punt)
wow. it really is too much to ask for bama to get blown out isnt it
FAT GUY PICK
Damn I was almost rooting for the Hawaiian freshman, and I hate bama
Bama still lucky as fuck
Holy shit for real?!
Right... But black panther tho!
The spice level is reachin max levels
ugh..............
That looked WAY too familiar.
Is dis real
Big boys are eating!
Fromm, would you like to put this game away?  No thanks 
TUA IS BACK ON THE MENU BOYS
Bruh
...God damn it.
That is so lucky, lmao
Lol it was all planned.
Can you believe that
That is so damn unlucky..
Big guy INT
HAVING A BIG ASS HEAD PAID OFF!
how the turn tables
Isn't that basically the same play that happened last week with Davis?
IT'S HAPPENING
Never got into College FB before tonight. This is honestly some of the best football I've seen in college, NFL or otherwise this year. Bama, you got my attention. 
Thicc bois gonna bail us out again!
Nothing singular sticks out, but he was basically only scrambling in the first half, couldn''t get the pass going 
Damn, I was hoping for another THICCSIX
Doink
The refs just singlehandedly made that interception. Smh
  M  F A T     N  
Im starting to think UCF should have the natty. 
You take it! No, you take it!
I don't know anybody can disagree with the sidelines penalties. On both occasions there were players and coaches on the field while the play was live 
YES
What the fuck is this game
Just do what I did for the cotton bowl and get blacked out.
Can u get a sideline penalty on alabama?
what is the quarterback position
Way to go Fromm, making that tackle! Way to go man
Ohhhhh shit!Fuck work in the AM, this game is awesome
OFF THA HEAD
Wow. That was unlucky.
Alabama has the most athletic big guys 
At this point I only root for Alabama just to watch heads fucking explode if they win. Prolly the same reason I'm pulling for the Patriots. The hate they get simply for being good is hilarious.Maybe some of it just comes from all the shit USC caught while they were still crushing everyone in sight.
Hmmm … who do you think fucked up: the 10 Alabama players blocking for a run, or the backup QB who chose to throw it in the field of play instead of out of bounds?
:DOINK:
Saban "everyone is fucking blocking"
And they'e both throwing to a Ridley brother!
Us: "Boring game"Players: "We got you fam"
Doink, lol
At least 15 guys from Bama on the field after the pick, where's their flag?
SABAN IT'S TIME TO ASS CHEW YOUR OWN ASS LIKE AN ASS-CHEWING OUROBOROS. 
Yep, they are freshmen QBs. 
Welp
Off the ole noggin...
I blame you u/macd7.  DON'T TEMP FATE YOU FOOL
Just got benched. Had kinda a shit half but in the in the immortal words of Pepper Brooks, "last game of the year can't hold anything back now"
Hurts just in case
Al the elephant 
Yeah can''t believe Tua picked him off
Thanks
Now that's what I call a heads up play
Welp, Bama's got a chance now.
That was WACKY
Good lord what are these kids doing
"*insert drake back to back reference*"
This game is nuts. Also, I love to see big man picks. 
Pick thicc
Threw it at his helmet. Ultimate derp.
Benched. I had to look it up too after watching on mute through the 1st half and into the 3rd. Looks like Saban is panicking, not sure how you bench him after only letting him throw it 8 (I think that what the graphic showed) times
Needs to throw it out of bounds, no extra air needed, don't put it in play and you keep the ball.
Hurts and you don't take the job away from the man who led you to the natty and has gone 25-2
F R E S H M E NRESHMEN
Both teams imploding, now.
WTFISGOINGON!
this game has become a fun train wreck lmao
That was a really stupid throw.
Nostradamus
I like riding in your truck because you are obviously you are driving the truck.As I typed this we got an interception. Maybe we can still drive?! 
Agreed. But the call on the field was in, and I can't say the replay showed it definitively 
Underrated comment (*grinds teeth, *looks at 2004 LSU team photo)
IT'S SCIENCE
Uh ok?
CHAOS IS A LADDER
Guys born in 1998 and 1999 are doing this.
Just when I think it''s cruising time
Let's just trade freshman interceptions back and forth forever. 
Wow
F R E S H M A NRESHMAN
Saban using force abilities again smdh
Good good. Want a nice close game. Shoulda fucking decked Fromm too
I did
Bama freshman QB throws Int. Georgia freshman QB - “hold my beer”
I was in the middle of writing "Where were you when the Bama dynasty fell?" and they get an interception...who was I to doubt their power...
True freshmen folks. 
This game is B ananana
"offense" 
Easy peasy. Just get the sideline warning immediately after
The location of the game was determined years ago. Plus, it's not like Alabama fans have to drive across country. 
Both of these offenses suck ass
So fucking big his gravity pulls the ball to him. Amazing awareness for a dude who is supposed to be rushing.
FUCK MOMENTUM
You've got a fair point. I guess my point was more along the lines of the human element letting things go by the wayside, but you're definitely right. A lot has been fucked up by poor officiating.
F R E S H M A N     P I C C
back to back picks. lol chaos aint done yet 
Just pinged it off #9 helmet
Fromm with that hit though....
BANANAS
oh, do me next!
What is this fucking game?
THAT BOY HAS GOLD HANDS
What? ATM tua is 1/2 tds. You are that fickle?
Yeah throw it at his fucking head ya goof
They're just playing monkey see, monkey do with one another
Stupid

LOL ofc
Fuckin freshmen. What a wild ass game
I don''t think you were alone.
Love this so much
Lol come on Georgia..
Where''s Bamas sideline warning?
99 awareness from davis
Anything you can do i can do ~~better~~
Refs are very confused that we don't want to see them. Pathetic. They are out of control. These are some of the dumbest/most suspicious penalties. Trash or devious - they fucking suck. Sideline warning for Bama?!
That's perfect. You could have the scene where he kills the guy be him getting chopped up by a lawn mower.
"Boop"
Saban has no more black magic Tua has got to win it now
Yo what is happening
Bounced off the fucking helmet
Whoa
My mobile app has crashed like 4 times y''all gotta chill
When they say "Freshmen" take a sip of beer.When they say "High school" take a shot. 
LOL all the people saying "this game is over"  it's the title game we have 4 more crazy moments yet to happen if not more
The fuck was that?  lol
FUCK
This has been a badass 8:40 to start the 3rd.  
Holy shit.
Now Bama getting lucky as shit
Oh that fucking plot twist 
Why would he even try to throw the ball there? Haha 
T H I C C P I C K
Game
This is wild 
God ducking damn it
Overreaction of the century
Nearly a THICC SIXTH

Damn bama's Dline got hands and moves 
YOURE A GOD DAMN WIZARD
LIFE! THERE'S LIFE! 
No...WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING?!
What is this game
Georgia being Georgia. lol
I'm googling this reddit thread just to post my shock at the QB change in a twelve point game even though no one will see my comment
How??
Now  that was just plain unlucky 
Gotta say. That''s jus bad luck. Fromm has a man wide open. 
Dis gonna be good.
Bama Big Boys can catch!
Oh my fuck
Georgia should really start running a spy
Holy crap that is some NCAA 14 shit
Fromm be like “well I better fix this”
We got a game again.
This can't be any better
This fucking game....
That's... not how PI works man.
2soon4me
Ahhh yes the classic spike the ball into the opposing linemens helmet play.
That's what Georgia gets for having dumb shoulder pads
Bama definitely got a head of the Georgia offense there
Those spiked shoulder pads are kinky 
 Oh goodness
Secure the ball young man
Strip that ball
lol, what else
You could almost hear the "Boink!" sound effect off that player's helmet.
Here comes an exact replica of the section of the Clemson game where Bama took over
tRuE fReShMaN qUaRtErBaCks
i can't believe i've done this. sry dawgs
kinky
Huge INT 
Welp
does every team have a turnover thing
Jake Fromm working hard to ensure an Alabama victory
Notice no one rushed the field there, hence no warning. Simple math really
Nobody knows and it's amazing
I''m gonna throw up
Big man interception!
[deleted]
Should have run the ball
HWAAAAAAAT
Bama goes 70% runs this drive. 
These threads are mostly worthless now.
SOB....
How hurt is the butt?
My thoughts exactly. 
It is weird to me that two teams with such great running games have basically abandoned the run.
Bruh this freshman QB is so reckless lol
big boy at it again
lmao falcon
Man that ball was loose on the way down. Better hold on better than that
The Commuter... Based on a true story. 
Tug Tagovailoa - Alabama called on one man to make difference.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZocvme6cYc
These aren't the two best teams in the country 
If I'm recommending three-ways, it's me, and two women really, truly, very far out of my league. But you do you.
#PIESMAN
Which one of you called the fat guy interception?
All these turnovers might turn this into a meme game.
Wow. That deflection seemed like just bad luck. If only the Georgia OL had been pushing the guy in literally any other direction or just a little faster or slower
ok, the fuck
LMFAO
well there's that.
LOL
that makes A LOT of sense. 
YOU MONSTER
Is he like 5'6 or wat
Saban made a deal with the devil. He stole Tennessee's magic. I'm sure of it.
REFS THREW THAT INTERCEPTION TOO
The calls in this game are TERRIBLE 
Wtf
What the fuck is going on?!
So lucky everytime 
Omg!!!!
Rachel Nichols'' LA crew is playing what appears to be beer pong NYC crew''s katie nolan notices, is upset because of an apparent no beer mandate for NYC
Protect the ball better kid
Inception 
How long until you get your Bdubs endorsement?
People shit on Tua for a dumb mistake, now he made one is what i meant
UNLIMITED HOLDING
What in the unholy fuck was going on here
Sloppy game.
Man shit I was about to go to sleep
Now a fumble 
But he couldn't get any points on the board. I'm not sure there's a right choice here.
SHANSHA PLEASE
Whoever Florida's QB is next year, please.
So, for the Bama fans here.How much of your offense issues this year is due to QB play and how much from your offensive coordinator?
Why if nobody running the ball anymore.
3rd quarter = best quarter
HAHAHAHAHA this game is hilarious 
I just saw someone saying "bama could use a fat guy pick" like 2 minutes ago.  Nostradamus needs to GTFO this thread.
LMFAO.  One turnover for another.  You gotta be kidding me.
Mariota would have turned that into a touchdown. 
Its almost like these QBs are freshmen 
OUR THICC BOIS ARE THE BEST BOIS
Alabama choking, time to move on from Saban.  Free him. 
Did you see 15 people run into the field? I certainly didn't
Post season Piesman tie!
THE GODS ARE NOT REAL
Ping pong.
*Davis with the interception* "Refs giving the game to Bama" How this thread is going.   
classic alabama vodo 
When in Rome...
Lmao off the helmet of a falling defender? How?
bruh what.
#RUN BIG BOY
Bamas second best pass!
:o are u a wizard
Geez Tua is gonna be legit scary. Rich get richer
Ahahahahahahahahahahahaahahahahahaha
But where was the sideline flag? I thought those were supposed to always get called on big plays.
This game is fucking crazy lol
Well that is a flair combo I've never seen before.
For such a relatively tame first half, the first 10 minutes of the second half have been fucking insane.
#CHAOS
Payne should be a top 15 pick.
hurts get injured?
What a fuck up.  Blatant holding on Georgia and a terrible throw. 
Not an injury. Probably a move to react to the speed of UGA's defense, and the fact that Alabama has to play from behind.
How the fuck does Bama keep doing this?
Wow, that's some killer athleticism. 
That was just a *great* play on that ball
Instead of trading tds, we have trading interceptions. Brilliant plays!
I was thinking Michigan but yours is better.
You stop this right now.
I like you
Who called the pick?
Who the fuck is calling plays for Georgia?  They can't stop your running game, run the fucking ball
So unlucky, sorry UGA :(
I don''t know what to take Fromm all this.. but teams are throwing Tua eachother
This dude is playing the NCG like I play madden after ive thrown my 5th pick 
It's getting late. If Bane doesn't show up soon, one of these teams is going to win. Gotta come up clutch, or hope for a meteor. 
These Defenses have like 100% Awareness on the Madden Stats
Sony was by himself too
Nice to think of how happy that fat dude is right now
#WTF
I'm listening to the Alabama Radio Call stream now, and it runs a lot better for anyone having trouble. I also am excited to hear them panic in the 4th quarter.
WHAT'S HAPPENING
UGA's offense doesn't suck ass lol
What a bounce for Bama
That's absolutely incredible reactions from the big man. I don't think I could catch that at slow-mo speed and he grabbed it above and behind his head.Amazing.
FAT GUY PICK!
Damnit man. All I wanted was a fat boy touch down. 
Tua *idolized* Marcusstill pretty salty he didn't come here
Don''t call it a comeback.
Lol this shits nuts 
Cry me a fucking river 
))<>((
This game got so good when Tua came into the game
"Bring out the Turnover Chain"*-ESPN*
So glad I decided to actually watch this.
Time for another DT to get a receiving TD
defense please
OFF THE HEEZY!
Georgia should have started that last drive with a run.
The game nobody wanted to win. 
Saban still has soul to sell apparently. 
The bama qb looks like a young russel wilson
Remembered I was wearing the same shirt from the auburn game, changed into my normal attire after the pick... Immediate pick
Lol ok chill. Bama's INT was a fuck up on their end. Georgia's INT was a fortuitously positioned helmet. 
You're a fucking troll.
The continued whining about a game that hasn''t even been that poorly officiated is even worse... 
Back to back interceptions gains Alabama about 30 yards.  Next level stuff, Saban is playing chess..
Can't wait to hear how the refs caused that pick
now this is freshman on freshman action
376 plays Jesus fuck
Where the hell is Alabama's sideline warning
Holy shit
Urban Meyer 
It was literally a near identical commercial they played on CFB games homie.
He carries the ball so loose. That would terrify me as a coach. 
The Empire Strikes Back!
Well shit. 
I just turned it on in time to see back to back interceptions.  
THIS GAME. IMMA THROW UP.
I never said I don't like hip hop, I fucking love hip hop which is why him lip syncing pisses me off so much. Rewatch the performance with your head out of your ass this time and you'll see exactly what I'm talking about. It was obvious about 5 seconds into DNA
THICC PICC
Tua "Marcus Mariota" Tagovailoa
That was a really stupid decision by Fromm … fastball from a yard away. Smart play would be to throw it into the ground in front of a guy.
Ouch
Well I guess we would've won this game then
Bro, I work at 6 am. Can I go to bed or not? What is this game?
**DOINK**
So apparently you're a 50% prophet? What else have you got for this game?
aren't you supposed to block on run plays?
Well that was premature lolStill agree tho
Ah, yes, the classic pass off the back of the defender in front of you into the arms of the defender behind him play I popularized in NFL Street 2
FAT GUY PICK!
Wow. Bama got lucky. 
hwat a tweeeest
Fuck, man, I wanna live
His helmet was open
Nah, real winner is the winner of this game.  Personally, I am not a fan of what we're doing with all this "championship" nonsense.  
Freshman
[deleted]
I bet you root for Apollo Creed in Rocky, too
I'm pretty sure it would be declined
What kind of spaghetti game is this!?
Tua just looks smooth out there. It's weird looking it's so fluid.
me thinks uga shoulda ran it
Now imagine Tua gets injured on a scramble and Saban has to put back in the QB he demoralized.
As is with any other sport,  lefty's just look so much more aesthetically pleasing for some reason 
Someone from bdubs keeps pressing the button
 Oh shit big man tip drill! 
You should contest UCF's national championship claims. They have ZERO quality losses.
Someone on this thread literally just predicted a UGA turnover. Give that man silver.
The slowmo on his arms was astounding.
"QB Duel" - Kirk Herbstriet
Not great, Bob
First turnover in a national championship game by Bama. That's crazy
freak pick 
Yea but this isn''t an Iowa team.
No thanks. I want to live through tonight.
I thought we were about to see a fat man touchdown there for a second.
Just tuned in, what did I miss?!
Someone just let Herby cum he's blue balling over an all true freshman Champ rn. 
god damn it i step away for three seconds and miss two interceptions including one by a fat guy
He fucking just doinked him in the head point blank, i cant even be mad thats hilarious
Just why not take the sack? Seriously? Why?
Offense looks different without Hurts.
Camera guy bout got crushed
Thank god i aint gotta eat no cat shit tonight 
Cheers! 
A Bama defensive lineman intercepted the ball ... this is how it begins isn't it ...
pick em off georgia cmon
Anyone saying the game is over did not watch the outback bowl. 
Because in two national championship games he's been effective on exactly one throw and one run. Other than that he's been a complete and total liability.
Fuckin threw it off the dudes head lol. 
That turnover stat is actually crazy
*doink* 
Just take the sack...
That's some Atlanta sports curse luck right there, right on schedule.
Except for the one earlier. 
Ok then
Isn''t Hurts like 28-2? He''s got a ton of job security but the reporters would run out of ink if it backfired.  Maybe he was nervous 
JESUS... can;t even refill my Swell 
Feelsbadman
RIP Camera Dude
I wonder what it's like being a Bama fan. Knowing that you'll win this game no matter what and getting to pretend that you're scared when you're momentarily down. 
Alabama's defense continues to be a better offense than our offense. 
So close
UGA just threw away their momentum.
No sideline warning on Bama after the int? Man these refs are only looming one way /s
Georgia just keeps shooting themselves in the foot, they got lucky with that last pick, but this Alabama offense is rejuvenated. 
nice catch
Go buy a lotto ticket
The Thiccness
60% play calling, the rest on Hurts 
What a twist!
This game is on drugs lmao
OOF
I feel like there are certain schools that get those types of breaks.  Oklahoma, Bama, and Auburn come to mind
Almost can''t afford too. They need the LBs to drop back into coverage 
Yes it does
Funny. All of the Alabama team ran onto the field. Not a single yellow flag to be seen. 
That camera man almost died in the back of the end zone.
That receiver almost just killed a dude
What a great try by that receiver 
My asshole is so puckered rn
Take a fucking sack you bitch
classic
10/10 form on that diving catch
That photographer dived out the way JUST in time
goddamn tua is airing it out and i love him for it
This is a wild CFB championship game. 
99 weighs 100 pounds more than me and probably has a faster 40 time. Yeesh
I know that was like 8 feet too long, but holy hell what a throw and catch there.
Nice photog reflexes.
Tua is thicc
This game is wild. 
Holy shit that camera man in the end zone! What a reaction!
I'm convinced every time the announcers say Tua's last name they're just flapping their tongues making noises and calling it close enough.
You looked beautiful the night you threw a pick.
Tua has been overthrowing almost everything
Why does everyone insist on sucking Bama's collective dick? 
That poor camera
My man... why do you continue to disrespect.
13,000 comments with five minutes left in the quarter.
that cameraman almost died
you say that like taking away a blocked punt isn't a big fucking deal.
The WR almost torpedoed a cameraman
Assaulting the cameraman? Typical Bama.
Almost killed a cameraman
Damn, that camera guy is tough.
Its been alright just now getting good
Cameraman almost died
FUCK TIPPED INTERCEPTIONS
Sign that cameraman. Elite agility.
Almost murdered some photographers
That would have been an amazing TD if he some how got that.
Where is the Alabama sideline warning?
UGA defense starting to lose the battle at the line of scrimmage 
somewhat shocked hurts isn't back in after that INT
The announcers got exactly none of those players' roles in that pick right
It's really hard to understand herbstreit with sabans dick in his mouth.
Almost RIP camera guy. 
"Couldn't come up with it"But he caught it.  Yes he's out of bounds but its not like he dropped or missed it.
He ded
Lol 
<3
That wouldn't have been in-bounds in canada
man, he sure likes to go deep
They letting them back in the game
I want to see his brain work that out. "Oops avoided the sack, hot potato!"
The refs only check one sideline apparently. 
Given the date of the article, I think that this is his last one. Maybe he stopped shooting for *The Commuter around September*?
Is it even a rule in basketball? If a defender is touching out of bounds and touches the dribbler it's not out of bounds?
Ah the old “Throw it at the defenders head” play. Executed to perfection.
Tuas release is fuckin solid
Well, that was a pretty extension.
Daboll hates his tight ends
They're talking about Tua's ability to run as if Hurts didn't run them to 2 consecutive title game appearances as a true sophomore. Dude is 2nd in TDs in Alabama HISTORY>
Tua has a goddamn cannon.
Got his head in the game 
Between this and the all state mayhem commercial.... All I can say is your move superbowl 
Best out of bounds catch
Apparently God wants Bama to win
He destroyed that camera guy
Did Bama just become Auburn?
i really like tua
Daboll is not my favorite. Hurts has regressed in the passing game.
wow, can't believe the refs missed that helmeting call
Can't tell. I'm using WatchESPN. All I see is the huddle, frozen on my screen for the last 2 minutes. 
TRUE FRESHMAN EVERYWHERE
That cameraman almost got smooshed
Dang, if we were three yards back, that's a beautiful TD. 
Literally how 
I love this game of 500 now 
That kid has a rocket for an arm
We need the photos from those photographers on that dive 
His mechanics are amazing. I''m interested to see how he does in a full season. 
That's gonna be a SICK picture
JAKE FROMM LAID THE WOOD
I can''t believe Saban is letting Tua open it up like this 
flair up nerd
Say no more fam I got you.
Cameraman just saw his life flash before his eyes
Almost watched a camera man get murdered 
Somebody's expensive camera just got destroyed.
Coaching, discipline and athleticism. You make your own luck.
 Ever question the Dark Lord. 
[Applicable] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNt0anp7WK8)
I swear right before that interception someone said "now watch a big guy get a pic" or something like that. super fuckin creepy
Get me the fuck out of this quarter and into the next one.
I like this Tua dude. Homie got a cannon for an arm and isn''t afraid to throw it 
Tua reminds me of VT Vick 
Wat? Thats Fromms 2nd Int today. Wtf are they talking about?
GAMEBREAKER
Camera dude with the clutch reflex 
Someone check thats mans shoes for springs.
Saban has some balls to send deep passes this often
Tua definitely has a fumble in him in this one.
Followed by a double fumble on the next play
Really nice grab if he was in bounds
>get the fuck over it
Glad that you can see my perspective! I can see why there would be a lot of attachment to the human element of reffing, but we need to remember that the human element of the sport is supposed to be about the execution on the field. Not the execution of the overly complex rule book.
How long did Herb practice saying Tua''s name...
Photographer almost got M U R D E R E D 
Fucking hell this Bama QB is going to be so good
Crazy quarter
He carries that ball like bread. Hes gonna fumble calling it. 
he's overthrowing, but the ball looks pretty when tua throws it.
Good awareness.  He dove out of the way. 
Bama benched their 25-2 starter and it''s working for them kinda
You can tell who is watching the ESPN stream. So far behind. Shit is ridiculous. 
*Big man...in a little coat*
Some men only want to watch the world burn.
Camera man got the hell out the way.
Same thing I've wondered for the last 20 years.
Dat arm tho
Yeah for sure with regards to touching the ball, just thought that concept would carry over. Thanks for the answer. 
i have to say i respect the hell out of bama receivers' effort on every play. pisses me off when players don't dive for balls they could reach and bama does it every time
I missed the first couple mins of second half - they say anything about why they took Hurts out?
https://imgflip.com/s/meme/College-Freshman.jpg
No doubt
Fuck bama 
Why Tua just now playing?
IDK, What's your Spaghetti policy? 
I called out tomorrow before the game started
WILD
Refs suck. Alabama put the backup QB in and he looks amazing.
Is Herbie gonna blow Tua after the game?
At least Tua's giving his team a shot to win.
I wish that was a bobbled pick as well. Because memes.
The helmet int
Is Tua the new Sam Darnold?
For me it's just because I hate y'all
Beautiful catch! Well out of bounds, but still beautiful.
Georgia what the fuck??? Why did you unleash this on us
The football gods give, the football gods take away. I ain't even that mad. Love seeing a big man run with the ball. 
So why is there a new QB in?
I just wanna see Bama get back in this an make it exciting.
Silver lining: We're 1.5 quarters away from start of Fulmer Cup season.
These fucking freshman standing till the last second before they get it. It's amazing. 
Herbstreit is such a moron. 
Holy crap almost another crazy pick
Tagman has a fucking cannon. Yeesh.
bullshit, isn't UGA supposed to catch that?
Fromm with the reverse Mariota.
WOOT WOOT!
News tomorrow, Jalen Hurts decommits from Alabama.
Holy crap, almost another one
Now this is a moronic comment. 
Camera Guy:*Naw he's not gonna hit me**Naw no way, he'll course correct**OH GOD HE'S FLYING THROUGH THE AIR AT ME**OH GOD HE BROKE MY LEG**pretty sweet shot though*
Tua looks like the Pacific Islander version of the guy from Workaholics
GOO
A lot of it has been OC.  The issue is with Hurts, we haven't been able to take advantage of the few chances we do get.
thx bb, pull this one out and we can watch r/cfb burn together
it's starting...
RIP Cameraman. We'll remember your pictures.
Lmao UCF wouldve destroyed either one of these qbs
Almost another pick! 
If that had been an interception omg
Thicc*
first offensive turnover* they've had a couple special teams turnovers before
I just heard on the Spanish broadcast. The fuck is with all these true freshmen qb''s?
Mini heart attack
Defense wins championships, and really shitty offenses lose championships. Looks like we have both here on both teams
why is tua playing? 
Missed a blatant block in the back on Bama there
Why you work so early, tell your boss to fuck off.
Does this fucking band play anything else other than Duel of Fates and that tune they play every time Bama does literally anything?
Tua looks like he's under 6 foot
B1G Game. B1G Refs. B1G man interception. 
Almost killed a camera man.
PKA?
No for sure it would. It was more that it came back to bite Georgia since if he wasn't held, Fromm likely would've taken a sack
Riley > Calvin don't @ me
lol
I highly enjoy them at this level. 
To whoever recommended Brisk Tea and whiskey back in the First Quarter thread...i love you
God damn that needed to be an INT
Bruh who wants to win this game
if that got picked I would've shit myself
I was for sure that was going to be another pick, lol. 
Fucking freshmen
Same.
That camera man was almost killed 
Lol I'm just imagining the Georgia player with his turnover spikes slowly taking them off after the bama interception.
Two down territory?
Wait so why isn''t Hurts playing?
I think they are like the Buckeyes the last two years. QB is an awesome athlete but the inability to stretch the field kills them against top defenses.
I like this Bama QB he's not afraid to bomb it.
Jesus that kid has an insanely fast release
Which team winning helps UCF more? I''ll root for them.
No probably needed
It's Monday night. My liver isn't conditioned for this kind of pressure
lmao stupid bama receiver use your extendo-legs smh
pretty sure thats why he wasnt starting.  putting him in is a desperation move.  
You can sleep when you''re dead
Kirk missed the ultimate off the heezy moment
dawgs please
"Fraud coach" with 4 national championships, played in 5 NC games, 2 Heisman trophy winners, 5 SEC titles...
the teams didn't show up so they had to grab 22 random fans to play the game. it's nuts
i'm rooting for georgia, but i was kinda hoping he'd run it back for the sake of this post lol
I thought for sure that ball was gonna get flipped into a defenders hands.
Almost another INT..
Key word though, he has been THROWING. 
Georgia ain't running, Bama ain't scoring, 3 interceptions - all by TRUE FRESHMEN - Hurts was benched
Holy shit there's still 5 minutes left in this quarter. Could it be any longer? We're at 13k comments lol
Who knew bellamy from the 100 was a baller 
DOG BITE ELEPHANT GO OW BRRRRRRTTTTTT ANGER SABAN MOANA
10/10 Swan Dive
Typical Georgia sports luck. Always choking in 2nd half.
Y''all remember the safe?
That camera guy had to dive lol
Just noticed that. This thread is moving like crazy
And thats literally **just** the 3rd quarter thread.
Like /r/cfb? Oh right, nobody here is doing that.
One more INT and I would have lost it
Someone tell Alabama that boy ain't Cardale Jones 
Good dive by the receiver, perfect dive by the cameraman.
God i wish that got picked for the full benny hill 
And he tried to drag his feet. Very impressive.
Every missed throw I''m like, “ touchdown if Baker was playing.”This is like a funeral for me. 
Saban has heart. He ran as fast as he could to 99 after that interception
I never watch CFB, what's with the big band music?
Man's got a cannon
I just hope everyone is having fun out there 
Saban was so busy wondering if he could chew his own ass he never stopped to ask if he should.
At least Tua THROWS
The bong off the helmet to start a comeback from a freshman QB would really be something.
If that had been intercepted I wouldn''t even be surprised at this point
“This...This is how I go”   -That camera man
Tau looks good but if this game is close late, I'd want the kid who lost last year on the last play out there. 
lmao this game is awesome 
Put Hurts back in. Just for now. I''m serious. 
He''s 70% fluid
Literally on my way to do that right now
make me
He jumped for that pass like a dolphin
Sims couldn't come up with it. Bitch even Superman couldn't come up with that.
Is this the worst Bama's offense has been in 2 seasons?
Ridley is garbage.
The real play there was the cameraman diving out of the way.
Was that not a chop block
Why does Tua have a J3 on his helmet? 
We all thought that was an interception, right?
Sick ass catch even if outta bounds lol
This kid is pretty good, just needs a little more discipline. He''s making the game fun for sure!
I want to steal Tua''s arm and jerk my junk with it. It''s so damn beautiful
Tua's play style is just like Russell Wilson
Not a great throw, but he's got to catch that.
Whoever wins this game is still not my championUCF is the winner this year in my heart
[I am as giddy as I can be.](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/excited.gif)
Every game that Alabama wins for the next 3 years is Georgia's fault now
This game is just a dang circus now...
Do UGA fans insist on complaining nonstop? we're up, stop crying
Okay then, I thought you were actually asking what happened.
My CSS has been off for the entire game
That was impressive!
I think Hurts is mature enough to handle it
Yeah he sucked
Man, praise the XFL for giving us the skycam. It really does make those replays nice. 
Bama could actually win this game with Tua. Hurts is just such a shitty QB that hides behind a mask of beastly athleticism.
why isn't Jalen at qb for bama?
that was a pretty throw
Ok, I wont lie. I do fuck with ESPN's sounds of the game stream. No commentators is so fucking nice
I would like to see what constitutes for a flag or warning on the sideline... see both teams pumped when they both do good things lol 
The fuck was #3 looking at?
This game needs another bobbled interception 
Smooshed got me lol
that guy aint fat. he's shredded
Georgia was on their A game the first half, Jalen Hurts was BAD. Georgia seems to have become slightly complacent, and Alabama's second string freshman QB is doing actually OK
If only Tua had been in all game.
Well his accuracy over 30+ is shitty. keep making him make the long throws. 
Bruh...
Hurts couldn't do anything. 
RIP cameraman
Photographer almost get exterminated
SaCK
Jesus christ freshmen, they''re making this game exciting by being so shook
Fromm made a freshman mistake. 
YES!
I would say that getting a blocked KICK reversed and a missed and blatant facemask on 3rd and long being missed are 2 HUGE breaks
This kid throws such a beautiful ball 
Wasn't some of the pregame commentary about how awesome these teams are at avoiding turnovers? 
Same play as the INT perhaps?
good stand by the Georgia D
Amateur
That was actually a nice pass
I''m not.
SHOW ME DA WAY
At this point, if you stay for  the whole thing, you''re getting 4 hours of sleep. It''s your call if it''s worth it. 
Very true.
I''m pulling for the dawgs but I''d be lying if it didn''t feel a little nice to see someone else''s dreams get eaten by the bama defense....shit still hurts
So am I the only person that noticed the homie wearing the Gucci sweater next to Saban?
Looked about as pretty as it gets.
He sucked. Really, really, badly.
Oh lord.  Doesn't he have a guy holding him back at all times?
Ahhh thank you for the correction. That sounds way more plausible
Homeboy almost killed that camera man tho. 
Ridley aint looking like a top 10 pick right now..
That was seriously impressive 
Boi
I still don't know who I should go for. All I can think about is how high scoring this game would be if OU made it. 
Idk why this made me laugh really hard
Their throwing isn't going to get much better. Accuracy rarely improves. Decisions do but not accuracy. Not enough to matter.
These throws are dangerous
Back to Hurts LOL
bama qb gotta learn to throw it away
They are. Stay out of this.
BAMA IS THE DEEP STATE WAKE UP SHEEPLE 
So it's pretty loud there
I wonder if the leftie spin from Tua threw Ridley off trying to catch that
Alabama QB needs to relax. Playing 200mph right now 
Tua channelling his inner Will Card Drew Brees with the 9D chess move. Why throw it to your receiver when you can throw an interception thats ultimately more beneficial later on?
Uhhh where's the flag? Bama is due for getting bailed out again. 
GIF PLEASE?! That was a beautiful lay out!
What the hell is that Imperial March-esque song one of the bands keeps spamming?!
Did someone say Field Goal?
Wow the Alabama o line is ass, my dudes.
Stop em 
Can anyone eli5 team chaos for me?? 
Did you step away twice? Because there was a commercial break between those 2 plays.
He really has gone downhill.
I really wish Georgia's band would learn a different song.^^Dun dun ^^dun dun duuuuuuuuuuuuun
there we go D, great stop
You''ll do fookin nuttin
Where's the flag? Georgia did a thing.
He sucks
What was it?
Oh man I can't catch this ball...I better....flip it up into the air!
Not a real man
Well then
I just want ESPN to get their shit together.
UCF fans coming out of their caves
This line knows one move: dive at the feet. 
All championship games should be played by freshman QBs, this is crazy 
Gonna be a long one for Pappa Nasty...
I always love the “Fuck I should have picked that” high steps. 
FG SQUAD
First time I've seen him play. He reminds me of Pat White but with a good arm
Just benched him at the half, no apparent injury
The line is falling apart
Who's worse: Jalen Hurts or the Bama O-line this drive?
QUIT UR JOB
Give it till 11:30 
That Dawg defense is vicious
Bama, actually. 
Well yea that's why they're the national champs 
Where''s u/therichesthomie?
Holy fuck, Tua can throw it greatly, but we call screens, fuck Daboll
I'm fucking GIDDY!! We're finally national champions!!
I hope that missed field goal doesn't decide this one, id hate for bamas kicker to feel that guilt 
I blame whichever announcer said "If Georgia scores at all this drive it's a three score game. 
Jesus, that was an easy 1st down. 
28 passing yards first half
Lads, it might be because it's the championship game, it might be because I'm drunk off a nice smooth cab after a long weekend of work, but I gotta say this:It's been an honor shitposting in these threads this seasonROLLLLLL DAAAWGS 
ESPN's sounds of the game telecast is the best. No talking heads. Just the crowd noise and the stadium announcer. Anytime there's a big play the noise is awesome!
My mom says Tua looks like a shrimp
Bama, you need block the blindside tackle...
Let''s break reddit
*intercepts off of a head”IT JUST MEANS MORE
It has already been three hours.
Aw man that would've been so beautiful. 
Honestly, even though it was out, the diving grab was dope
That missed FG kills them now. They could be cutting it to 7
BBBBBBUTTTER FINGERS
turn him into a RB
Not exactly a gimme field goal here.
That was a weird bobble. 
If I'm bama I go for it 
Safe word?
Alabama's first not Georgia
Shank
Bama. Georgia waxed Auburn the second time they played
Hurts was sucking it up in the first half, so they subbed him out at halftime.
An Alabama loss is always a win for everyone
yeah.... he actually has a future...
Yu must hav Ebola tu noe de wey
Dude is going to throw another pick before this game is over with. Calling it now
OH MY LAWD so clossseee
Wish I was in oxford watching this :L
reported 6'1 so prob 5'11
Yo dawg, I heard you like interceptions
Them Dawgs is Hell.
THOSE ARE ROOKIE NUMBERS
He sucked 
I'm not sober enough to process that 
My dog is tired but doesn''t want to quit watching. He keeps going in his crate, then comes back out to stare at the TV.
Why isn't Bama's normal QB playing?
Whew. Another FG miss plz?
I would support the fuck out of this being a rule
It''s good except it''s all being over thrown 
They kick those in college? 
Swear to god every time they say a word that starts with an F i get pissed. I just think its flag taking away a great play. 
I''ll say it for him, “IT''S SCIENCE”
Looked like crap
Pappa nasty
I AM ROCK HARD. I LOVE THIS SPORT. DRUGS.
Waiting for the flag here. 
Hey bro can I have you around for the Jags game next week?
There's something about this guys throwing motion that just seems strange
I'm amazed Tua even saw him. He was in there so fast. 
Hell yeah. The can''t deal with pressure. Even with Alabama holding the d line like no other. 
Seahawks will draft them all.
I wonder how Alabama will respond next week against Mercer
Is that the alabama band playing the same song after every fucking play????? FUCK PLAY SOMETHING ELSE
WHY DOES THE ALABAMA BAND PLAY THE SAME THING AFTER EVERY SINGLE ALABAMA PLAY
Ref almost snagged it
unless this Georgia defense decides to collectively do heroin between now and the end this game is over GO DAWGS
Looks like he just got benched.
Because he is trash and Saban knows it
That makes sense, I didn't know that. Thanks!
good hold
clutch kick all things considered
Nice series by Georgia d
So far Tua's thrown many more deep passes than Hurts while completing exactly as many.
Has Nicky thrown this many times in a row ever?
Hurts transfer to Georgia tech confirmed? 
God I hope true freshman Trevor Lawrence can win the starting job at Clemson next year.
PAPANASTY
oof
He's being chased around
for real. very aesthetically pleasing. 
Hurts seemed too eager to throw the ball away, and Tua seems really unwilling to throw the ball away...
Oh I thought there was going to be another one!
Thank you based Papa Nasty!
It really is.I was going to say it looks like a Pee Wee version of Wilson vs Aaron Rodgers tonight. 
YOU DO NOT KNOW DA WAY
that was troy palumalo levels of getting off the line
PSA: Flair up everybody before you talk trash. Thank You
Kid is going to be a great qb, but he is going to give the ball awaybagain before the game is over 
lol fair enough
That''s a hell of a last name for the kicker 
PAID
I MEAN IT'LL GET YOU DRUNK EVENTUALLY, SO IT HAS THAT GOING FOR IT.
The story of this game is Georgia's defensive line is absolutely destroying Bama's offensive line. 
KIRBY KNO DA WAY
Pappappananstos with the field goal!
lol well shit
rumor has it that if you toss a football against your backyard fence, a huge Alabama defender will appear out of nowhere and snatch it out of the air 
Yeah, poor timing on my part.  That's a throw he doesn't make in two years though.
Update on the Bama prayer group if anyones interested, they have now progressed to a shared instagram live. 80 viewers. What even is this. Edit: live ended after field goal
Lol that dude caught it
that was ugly.
Womack, why am I not surprised to see you here you piece of shit
Saban wanted yards in the air, Jalen wasn't delivering them, Tua put in.
BoringTHEM DAWGSSaban shookWhen were you when hurts was killMUH TRUE FRESHMENInterceptionsNow
Oh jeez college kicking
Why is bama not running it? 
I do not like this fact.
Pappanasty trying to redeem himself
fg miss #2 incoming
Papa Nasty
HE CAUGHT IT
Phantom of the Opera
I love how he pulls the trigger, just a bit too much zip on it though.
Man what a game. I was a little apprehensive at a SEC NC but fuck, Chubb deserves this.Bama is surprising me with the lack of offense.
Bad offside non call
Nah it''s light blue if anything. 
tf?
This is about to be a 4 and a half hour football game, assuming it doesn't go to OT
What's up 3rd quarter peeps? I'm just sittin' here watching the 3rd.
That could have been way, way worse...
Shit he made one?!?
How was that not illegal receiver down field? 
Well that could've gone worse
He was benched for playing badly
Jalen Sucks 
Poor performance in the first half, had less than 30 yards passing
Georgia is fortunate for playing well?Fuck this Nick Saban circle jerk from Herbstreit. 
Bend don't break. Can we run now?
The guy that caught the ball lol
I'll take it. 
That had enough leg to be good from... 44? Maybe. 
Are there any left handed QBs in the NFL? Can''t think of any at the moment. 
Ed Orgeron is somewhere trying to give that kicker a scholarship
but does the bama kicker have dope goggles?
lol fair enough
I'm so tired. But this game is entertaining as hell. 
Shit 1st half SEC defensive battle. 2nd half Big 12 TRUE FRESHMAN quarter back shoot out. Lmao
That missed field goal looms large now. 
Bama's offense has been inept against pretty much every solid defense they've played.
Tua look so unnatural as a thrower
Probably ran on the field or something like that
Ridley hasn't had the best throws to him this game but honestly man let's get in the game dude, we need you to pull out something big. 
20-10. Good year.
Is that Von Miller
That play took way too long to develop.
Georgia. Auburn beat Georgia 40-17.
cause he sucked
Put that man in at WR
You could mop the floor with Jalen Hurts' hairhttps://goo.gl/images/xk2J9z
FUCK that missed field goal is looming large
BOILER UP
Saban only benched Hurts because 25-2 and his phone screen didn't give him enough of a chip on his shoulder
Lefty?
bro longest third quarter ever.
Coach's film room is excellent.
I''m already hungover
To start Tua all season you mean?  I get that, but to put him in at halftime of the National Championship still seems pretty nuts.
> I would say that getting a blocked KICK reversedIt was a false start, so it wouldn't have counted either way...
It's only halfway through the 3rd? This is the longest game ever
"Shootout"*20-10*
goddamn that Georgia defense is so fast
Happy Cake Day
Grandpa was totally watching alien porn in that Rugrats episode. 
Only 10 points down. We can do this.
shew
He got such a good jump I'm surprised he wasn't flagged for offsides.
Well... we have some solid guys, for sure, but none have shown what Fromm has this year for UGA. Haskins did look nice in his snaps this year. He could be in the same realm, but we'll have to wait and see what he can do with a whole season if he's the starter. :)
God damnit just when I thought I could go to sleep. 
How come Bama has not had a great qb prospect despite all these amazing years under Saban?
Yes.
ENOUGH OF THAT FUCKING SONG MARCHING BAND
Did Georgia sIT back on that FG?
noice
Saban shook
Sick catch by the guy in row 1
Highway to the danger zone
[removed]
Ayyy lmao
Wasn''t playing well
Wasn''t doing anything in first half. This freshman drove them to a TD on their first drive of the second half.
They already got Patterson from Ole Mi$$.
Georgia needs to feed Michel.
Someone told him where the goal posts are!
True freshman playing his first game in the Natty...i would say he's handling himself ok
Because he threw for like 27 yards in the first half
He''s not v good at football
so he turned into a trophy, sweet
I do love me a good fat man interception.
No one will see this but I'm dating someone twice my age and I love it
Woah You guys are commenting faster than I can read. Love y'all
He keeps throwing back across his body and across the middle and you'll be right. 
BAMA MADE A FIELD GOALI REPEATBAMA MADE A FIELD GOALTHIS IS NOT A DRILL
3 hours in and we aren''t even in the fourth, fuck ESPN
Now kiss yo sis for good luck <3
That feels like the longest we've hit in a while
And Fromm making the tackle, awesome!
Dawgs know da wae
Alabama does not know how to play from behind. 
This quarter has everything.
I hate the earth. 
And a fumble, he has no clue our lbs are right next to him when he throwa
Your MSU isn't the real MSU. 
[SERIOUS] Why is Watchespn so bad when ESPN is a huge company and other streaming services have no issue?
Is Alabama the same school Forest Gump played for?   Helmets look familiar 
Missing that field goal in the 1st really hurt.
Still a LOT of football to play here. 
Lol how tf did that ball get through the net?
He's left handed.
stop calling screen passes wtf
Can someone kindly explain to me how Bama OL are able to tackle Georgia pass rushers without a holding call? I''ve seen it at least 3 distinct times now. 
As long as I see no more Jalen Hurts I don't care.   
Yay! Papa got one!
GEAUX TIDE!
seriously, is that too much to ask?
OUCH!
there is so. much. game left
Glad I''m not the only one
The lefty aspect looks odd, I''m a left and it still looks weird. 
Sidearm southpaw 
Knights don't live in caves ya dingus
Deal
Do you think Tua's teammates call him Moana
Lets swap Tua and Hurts every play
Such is life as a Bama fan
Yea i saw someone say right after the alabama pick "im kinda feeling a georgia int, but that might be wishful thinking"Went to go try to find it but it got buried too fast.
Any fellow Georgian-Atlanta Falcons getting triggered or is it just me?
So who's gonna move on to face UCF
Come on Daboll we can still feed Damien Harris
Is that what that guy is being paid for?!
no chill
They do that EVERY SEC GAME. It gets old
Saban 3D Chess - let your star rest-up during the 3rd quarter.
Alright not bad still 2 scores
Every scoring play. It's the fight song. 
hit by FLAG in the backfield
Lol
Lol
let's go dawgs, get another td, let's go baby
I SWEAR TO GOD GEORGIA IF YOU LOSE THIS
If Saban such a genius why no start Tua?!?
I'm gonna miss Flowers :'(
This is enjoyable for me for two reasons1. Bama is losing 2. If I squint I can pretend it''s the Buckeyes. 
I have no idea where this game came from, but it's pretty fun
Georgia with a true freshman QB and that draft class. Goodness is going to be a rough few years 
1020, great year
hopefully Fromm shakes the INT off. That was just a fluke play really.
Saban took him outEdit: Maybe not Saban, cant remember the OC's name
He is left handed. It looks weird
The bands are a very important part of the sport
Hurts has got that old young man Breshad Perriman look going on. 
this game has been busted wide open idk what to expect anymore and i love it
Pappa bless
Isn't it a flag to have 3 linemen downfield Kirk?
Probably Bama.Georgia is one of the most consistent and complete teams this year with not only a win over the team that beat them but a conference title. That national title would be undisputed.
I'm no expert but I think it's because he sucks.
Look up our first half offensive stats
he garbih
He looked like shit last drive, bro
Maybe in madden or something 
This game will be over at 2 am. 
My liver can't handle this and I don't drink.
How can I get some commentary ;_;    this ESPN stream has none and it's weird 
Shootout might be a relative term here Kirk
Bama O-line getting rekt 
Got benched due to poor play at half.
Same. Neutral leaning toward Georgia 
Can't handle it!
I wonder if he's in the MLB draft. 
It is the imperial march, we play it on 3rd down
benched
Benched
He''d be a great running back. He''s a fucking shitty qb 
I still think replacing your 25-2 starting QB in the NCG is fucking crazy. 
Kirk Herbstreit: “Friendship ended with Baker Mayfield, now Tua Time is my QB best friend”
When we play bama next season it's gonna be the battle of the hawaiins
B1G trying to hijack the national championship
[deleted]
20-10 is a shootout apparently
Because he sucks. 
Seems like it's rare for Bama to miss more than one FG in a big game. It has, of course, happened, though.
He's not that good
Russel Wilson right?
sonny zipton
Got benched 3-8 21 yards and looked lost majority of the team
"What do we say to the God of missing two fields goals of 40 or more yards?""Not today"
I wish this game would speed up. Damn commercials.
Does this fucking band know like any other songs? Holy fuck
Why are so many of you using WatchEspn? Do you not have cable?!?!Edit - Okay you cut the cord but can''t get it to steam smoothly? Better off with cable. 
FeelsBadMan :( 
Can he?
Is he back to being papanasty? It looks like it!
He sucks and they benched him
He sucked all first half and this new guy has breathed life into the offense
Thx bby
If the WR catches that it's an easy first, UGA's defense bit hard on those. 
god damn it's not even Q4 yet. you holding up east coast bros?
Look at the first half passing stats.
They benched him after they got shut out in the first half
This quarter is  taking a long time. Please start running the ball 
This doesn't feel like a championship
[deleted]
To be fair, after Bama's back up (not even gonna attempt to spell his name) marched down the field, it looked like it was shaping up to be a QB duel. 
Really happy the defense held them to 3. Great job
Like Muammar Gaddafi, that ball was overthrown.
This some good stuff right here.
And he's a lefty.
I don''t think y''all even offered him until something like 2 months before signing day. Apparently there was something with his grade for a while.
Not even close
A true fan
Probably the Imperial March...
Papa bless
Why didn't he miss it?Boo!
Can we please talk about the athleticism of that camera guy on the ground that dodged the diving Bama receiver??
r/salt here really showing its true colors in this thread man
SEND IN THE DUCKS
damn boys we have a whole notha quarter after this
Tua's got the opposite blindside. Lots more pressure on the right side of the line
sounds you could use some... coffee_and_range
1st half: Play not to lose2nd half: Play to win.
This game should not be close. UGA is on another level.
More like Maui
Hurts played like ass first half
Kellen moore was the last until he just retired
They had no reason to take out Hurts TBH he would be doing the same as Tau rn. 
Could be a one score game if he made the shorter one.
I'm rooting for UGA but the game definitely is not over
If Pappanastos made his first FG, we have a 1 score game
Rude 
He cant do anything
I hope Georgia scores so we can hear "I've Been Working on the Railroad" some more 
Damn lefties
[deleted]
Thanks
Probably hears “dog” ever 2 seconds
He is left handed. That may be something.
Holding is Fake News
I'd say we have a SLIGHT better chance than USC does..but I'm no expert 
Jeez Kirk, I don't know what Bama's QBs complexion has to do with anything...
B- on form but 3 on the board.
I''ll take the long throws. Only takes one to get us back in the game
Iowa beating Osu was a win for team chaos. 
Bad non face mask call. Goes both ways 
Are you complaining about bad calls with that flair?
Q U A L I T Y LOSS
spun right out of his hands
Yes.  Let the overconfidence flow through you...
Why is this game going to be like 5 hours long
Gonna go take a 90 minute nap to catch the beginning of the 4th quarter
Can ESPN ever stop sucking Alabama''s dick? These two are terrible calling this game. 
So conflicted. Love Tua, but miss Hurts. 
lotsa money to be made in the championship with commercials
He's ass man
they'll be gone after the game anyway
No idea why we didn''t put any pressure on him. 
He was playing terrible
Ah, in that case ignore my drunken bitching 
That pick was the first turnover in a NCG by Alabama in the Saban era.
I am impressed with the football is of these coaches on the coaches room. They see things so fast.
Looks like both teams fueled up on Butters' creamy goo™ at halftime
You see a lot of people professionally filming with those dslr's these days
Nick Saban likes cheese pizza HINT HINT
Lol, I wouldn''t 
NDSU
Welcome to the same shit we have been hearing all year with Barrett...
Don't all lefties? 
The last 5 minutes of this game will probably last 45 minutes.
Dude. No.
Huh?
This games going to end at 1:00am
I've been on the phone for the first 2.5 quarters and haven't been able to shit-comment at all. Finally feels like a cfb game again now that I can join you degenerates.
This scoreline looks like overtime guys. Glad I don't have shit to do tomorrow.
trust me dude, you have no idea.  USC is SO much worse
Games like this are way more enjoyable when your team isn't playing.I know the feeling of both fanbases.
[deleted]
I know I do
You want Georgia to win in blowout fashion.  Strengthens the argument that Bama should not have been in the playoff.  Would UCF have gotten the spot? No.  Look, just go dawgs, okay?
That's strange
Well they almost had Fromm...
Ok that makes sense that it was further behind the receiver
Watching the mega cast is pretty great. I realized I don''t know shit about football watching these coaches. 
I feel like benching Hurts was probably a dumb move. This kid is pretty good, but Hurts has been good for Bama consistently and plays well at the end of games
And waive the redshirt rule, too. I would actually like if they did that for all bowl games.
Easy, Kirk. 
Iowa State
French fry head ass
It's even crazier that it's been working. Sort of.
That was majestic
Because Brian Daboll. :-/
?
Fromm having the best two INT game ever
Ok, 12 minute 80 yard drive please. 
The time between PAT and Kickoff is hilarious. 
I'll die if I have to.
DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN
Awww I''m sorry, bud. I think you''re special. Ain''t no one else out there quite like you and that makes you a diamond. 
This thread is like twitch chat lol
So much passing we are back on track for that after midnight finish 
UCF 2017 Cational Nhamps
Maybe give Michel some carries now.
Pap smear
I'm going all the way
6 point swing caused by a dumbass throw 
Don't think I've ever seen Alabama call plays like this. Makes sense since they're rarely behind the way they were. 
Barely
The Browns
Hurts mulling over that transfer decision already. Will let us know post game.
There was a lineman 7 yards downfield if that third-down screen actually was caught.
[deleted]
THEY DIDNT COME HERE TO PLAY MUSIC SCHOOL
That's fucked up you're dating a 24 year old
I saw it 
I prefer 10-20 but you can't go wrong with either. 
Not quite the same thing though, since Berringer started most of the season and Tommie hadn't played in a game since September.
Missing that wide open TD in the first really hurt
Dude they''re barely moving the ball on the ground.... 
SIR, YOU GOT TO REMAIN CALM 
Cant say it isnt bold
U r da fek quen 
TRUE FRESHMANthat's all you're missing
Refs
Why isn't Alabama running it?
Makes more sense, thanks! 
Gotcha, just weird that they wouldn't even explain the flag. They usually replay like everything.
The only thing that could make this commentary worse would be if ESPN decided to retroactively resurrect Brent Musberger's career.
SABAN WOULD MAKE AN AWESOME LITTLE SPOON. UNFORTUNATELY I CAN'T HANDLE THE NOXIOUS SULFURIC FUMES. 
Kellen Moore just retired like yesterday and I think he was the last one
Yea the lineman almost caught that and he was 10 yards downfield
Everytime I see that allstate net im just hoping it lands right in the hands
I'm okay with what is happening right now but I do have a thought.Next year I hope they work Fromm on throwing out of bounds under pressure rather than trying to make a play every fucking time. It is selfish and is giving me hemorrhoids.
each quarter has a few more commercials. shits getting out of hand.
Yes
Saban benched him because he wasn't producing.
Pretty sure that's Bama. Because that sound haunts my dreams. 
doing the one with the commentary freezes every 5 seconds
I thought Bama was gonna whoop Georgia because of their experience, I was wrong
as i said to the other guy, USC's band is infinitely worse
Umm... 2/3rds 
He wasn't playing well. I love Jalen, but he wasn't gonna win this game. 
I''m talking before that, on the 80 yard receiving TD where the player''s heel nearly went out of bounds. You''re talking about the “sideline warning.” I saw footage of that one. 
Hurts is mad regardless of the outcome now
Especially since one of those losses is in an NCG and the other is to your rival. 
ITS TUA TIME
Georgia band > Bama band - band nerd 
To make it even more confusing, I''m pretty sure interference is enforced differently based on whether or not it affected the play, like how the interference call on Georgia was enforced as a dead ball foul because it didn''t affect the play.
Gj bama your first points I will actually recognize
Announcers trying to talk to his game up, when in reality it''s actually been pretty fucking boring
I hope our d ain't completely drained. Need a stop. 
Can we get some more of those slant plays?
espnnews coaching table
Answer:Who is the coach of Alabama. 
A lot of ball game left to play. C''mon Bama 
Barely. Work tomorrow will suck. 
Hardly. Gonna be a rough 7 am
Kellen Moore was the last one and just retires. I believe.
True Freshman QB comment. Drink!
Once Tua gets his timing right with his receivers on the deep balls the Bama offense is going to be deadly.
Is Scarbrough hurt?  Only 2 carries
But it's fun! 
Yeah it's called being left handed... 
Show the fight you assholes
fan rushing the field?
I'm getting a real Sexy Rexy "fuck it we're throwing downfield" vibe from this kid.
Let him rest up for the 4th Quarter. Saban 4D Chess.
Isn't a QB supposed to pass though
He's left handed
Ok. I certainly did. Do I win?
put both qbs out there
Fuck Alabama. 
Hardman-Bot has learned from his earlier mistake
Blewitt is still my all time favorite  
Kirk is trash
UCF > Alabama 
Where will Hurts transfer to next year?
Streaker?
What will Jalen''s phone screen be now? 
Got benched
THERE'S A FIGHT AND YOU PAN AWAY
Man I was really expecting the surprise onside kick from Bama there
He's been terrible. That was Clemson and auburn hurts showing up. 
Yes, certainly. But more than once he has had time to set his feet, but he throws on run instead. He also is firing the ball in there every throw. Take that last throw before the FG...hummed it in there and receiver couldn''t make a play 
Saban's ~~evil~~ glorious scheme to throw off Georgia's studying of Hurts
You're not missing much. 
It's because he's left handed
Kinda like Harbaugh benching Smith
Definitely not looking forward to work tomorrow
What's the lucky fellas name? 
Lucky, just enjoy that.
Didn't UCF already win? 
When's the last time UGA won a natty? If they hold on we could have 2 years back to back of longish droughts being broken. 
We lost two starters to injury. 
Fans roaring, ref running up field, CUT TO THE BOOTH
why is hurts benched?
Does your ESPN stream have anything? Because all i'm getting is choppy-ass buffering.
I still don''t understand why coaches opt not to invest in special teams coaching. Edit: though if Bama wins I guess it''ll prove that it''s a risk/reward balance.
I am a Georgia fan and I keep forgetting 
Shook off the first one
Jalen Hurts is a fucking alien or some shit what is wrong with that kid 
more talking about true freshman, whoo
We''ve scored ten points since then. 
I'm biased here, but the Rose Bowl was the One True Championship game.
You wrong so I wont lol. Unless you just mean tonight, and then sure.
Needs development that''s for sure
ThEy WeRe In HiGh ScHoOl LaSt YeAr
Kellen Moore was the last one, for now, I believe.
Iirc Kellen Moore or Bryce Petty was the most recent so not really.
I'd much rather have no commentary :/
That's what UCF and Nebraska fans are saying, too
Championship was a week ago
"Not the prettiest" field goal? WTF! It was perfectly centered through the goal post?!?!
did...a fight or something happen on field??
Why did Bama bench their 25-2 QB in the NCG game? He wasn't doing poorly enough to get benched...
Better make that 105.
Kellen Moore, Cowboys backup, only one
Pretty sure he was benched for Tua
They fightin?
This game is going too 1230. Fucking disgusting
Less commercials in the 2nd half, I think.
Hey it''s not Boomer Sooner
Link? Please?
Same. 
It''s not. UCF already won that, apparently 
Nah just on time
Tua's ridiculously talented but he panics every time he sees someone coming at him. He's gonna be scary af next year though 
Yeah lol. Played for Bear Bryant
4.5 hour commercial**
3 seconds may have been an understatement.  i ate dinner lol
Show the dam fight. 
right about now is when I wish I didn't live in the eastern time zone, 8am class is a bitch
Was Jalen Hurts just not playing well or was he hurts?
I seent it.
just as your comment proves..of course you are correct
I know Tua is making mistakes, but he''s going to be great.
SHOW THE FIGHT YOU UPTIGHT FUCKS
"The complexion of the game has changed"Someone get the Proactiv!
wORsT p5 diviSIOn iN FoOTbaLL!!!
would it be fair to say that it looks like alabama has a lot of players on offense that look like they're choking?
As of right now it's not been such a terrible decision. They finally scored 10 points in the 3rd quarter.
Close enough to Tebow time.
That was what they call "a silly joke".
Tell us what part of Alabama's resume warrants them being top 4
SHOW US WHAT'S GOING ON ON THE FIELD
If it's caught behind the line of scrimmage I believe it doesn't matter 
nope still jerkin' it
A lot of people have cut the cord 
They gotta mix it up shit is annoying
Time for Jake the Shake to slam the door on the Tide.
How many 3rd down conversions has Bama made this game?
Ohio State vs UCF who wins? 
Just say your own commentary out loud. 
I''ll trade you this game for a falcons Super Bowl win over the Patriots.
They cut to the broadcasters during a fight, come on man!
In all seriousness, Jalen Hurts is handling being benched in one of the biggest games of his life pretty damn well. Staying positive, cheering for his backup. Speaks volumes to his character right there.
Freshman
No, tune in between now and September and you'll get plenty. 
Definitely a high risk/high reward move.
There was a fight and they didn't even show it
so does Bama put Hurt back in at all or do they stick with the Freshmen the rest of the game?
OMFG THEY CALLED A FLAG ON BAMA WTF? 
Wait, what is this?
Might as well be OU's or USC's band. 
Roughing each other up now - that's why they switched from the field.
Bloop
Put them both in!
These last 5 minutes I've said "you Hawaiian muthafucka" at least 20 times. Am I racist? 
ROLL TIDE LEGGO
I agree, deep in the 4th your newb qb wont be able to handle it 
Wasn't engaged with another player so no, risky block though
Ducks fan now quack
SHOW US WHAT EVERYONE IS RUNNING AT ESPN YOU DIPSHITS
Benched at half time for being Jalen Hurts.
Poor guy
I don't think they've learned the song of their forefathers yet.. Dueling Banjos
I'm not looking forward to playing Fromm in Athens his junior year.
There's no O in Alabama LMFAO.  2018 Champs.  I'm not kidding, this is the best night of my life.  I might have to get the wife pregnant after this!
Honestly, it doesn't seem like there have been a ton of commercials.
If Georgia doesn''t win this could lead to a 300% increase in incest babies in the US. Georgia, please, think of the children.
Go to r cfbstreams 
bama can still win this but its not looking good.
Lol.
Alternating coffee and beer. It's a shock to the system, but working so far.Tomorrow is going to suck though. 
For real. Who tf thought playing Monday night was a good idea
Get in line. Ol Kirk's Alma Mater hates him too
So legit question about kickers for top tier schools like this.Do they recruit kids who only kicked in highschool and stuff? Or are these kickers basically the same soccer players that my highschool used? 
Eject 
that's all i care about in this game
Yes. Give in to your anger. 
No he wouldn't have. He has no pocket presence, and he can't throw down field.
you missed some of it, but don't worry, there will be more.
Are you sodium mad or what 
Kinda sucks to be Jalen right now. Imagine having having that natty L in your head that entire season only to make it and be benched. Its a meritocracy I know, but I feel for him.
Lol
Alabama + crazy people = that.Even as a fairly religious person, I would never entertain the thought of praying over any sporting event. You think God cares about sports lol? 
Dude, yes. Chris Fowler is not having a good night. 
Are you watching "sounds of the game?"
Dilly dilly
Coaches room or all 22 
2 TD lead with 20 minutes to go and they throw on 1st and 10.  Reminds me of another team from Georgia from last year...
I kind of want to hear Rammer Jammer just to see if any riots break out.
1980 I think 
Born in Jeff city, raised in Springfield with family in CoMo then my brother went to school at alabama! 
Oh damn
oh damn
Trophy kinda resembles a giant tube worm
Frue Treshman
You have got to be kidding me?
What a dumbass. 
We want Bama!
What in the ever loving fuck 
Reddit can''t handle the championship, even when it''s done in separate threads by quarters 
Why the hell did you need to go to the announcers? We missed the unsportsmanlike!
Show the fight espn
DID U HEAR THESE GUYS ARE TRUE FRESHMEN????
You can't do that
To be fair one was from a throw to a helmet and a side of luck. However, yes, this is the worst possible time of the season to commit any turnovers.
YOU IDIOT
HOLD UP YOU CALLED THE WRONG TEAM
FIFTEEN LONG YARDS>>>>>>>>
put in eason
wtf eject that bitch
That sounds amazing honestly, but are you sure you're not watching the sky cam feed? 
Not gonna lie,the sounds of the game feed is awesome. i have been enjoying it so far.
These kids are dumb as hell.
Does anyone else remember when Gary said Jalen Hurts should win the Heisman? lol
What happened to Jonah Williams
Lol Ref took off
Lonely Space Vixens?
Good for you. 
fuck how could i have not said that originally. DUMB THICC
Throw his ass out
Man B1G refs like being seen.
This ref is angry
Does this ref seem sassy to anyone else? 
One of Herbstreit's worst games to memory 
Punched a player and didn't get thrown out? smh
uhh thats an ejection
Saban loves those unsportsmanlike penalties. 
I can''t even imagine how Hurts is feeling. He couldn''t get anything going in the first half, then Alabama comes back and has both scoring drives led by Tua
COME ON DUDE WHAT THE FUCK DONT ACT LIKE THAT 
Over 13,000 comments with 5 minutes left.
should be ejected tbh
With this team, and their draft class, Georgia 2019 is going to be one scary monster.
Oh snap. You can't do that 48.
He should be ejected 
Lol that guy should have been ejected
That refs sounded so disappointed saying Alabama
bettors gonna be sweatin over that over / under
Because they have a captive audience and they *can* have a shitty app
I'm with you on fuck ESPN, but the game didn't start until 8:25ish.
WTF EJECT HIS ASS!
Hot take: Saban has lost control of his players
Lmao dude had a shit eating grin after being punched.
How is punching a player not an ejection?
Do you think Jalen has made Tua the background of his phone yet?
The refs are speaking in this scolding tone that amuses me.
Alabama undisciplined as fuck
Should have been thrown out.
Typical
NO! Left!
Man I wish i got into CFB this season. I only watched the NFL. College football  is what the NFL wants to be
Great camera work ESPN, we don't want to see any of these penalties
not a nother one of these nail biter games... im still recovering from last week
Refs penalizing Alabama so they can win them the game later. 4D chess.
This B1G officiating crew is calling Alabama out on their shit, and I love it.
Last year was like that too. Really drew out the heart attack haha
Herbstreit is a fucking jabronie 
84 just laughing. I love it. 
Saban bout to verbally beat that ass.
Tua: I'm going to make a Freshman mistake. Fromm; hold my Gatorade 
Shoulda been tossed for that shit.
Why is he not tossed? That was a full swing
I think the ref said the wrong guy, he threw a flag on an alabama player by mistake
And 48 isn't playing anymore...
when bama get points scored on them i say yes  when bama score points i say no 
Big ten don't play that shit. 
They're playing less commercials. Wonder if they play more in the first half to get them out of the way 
the ref sounds like an angry, bitter old man
The former
What better time to flex than when on national tv?
"For now."
Damn that is impressive restraint by Georgia
wtf dude
Classic Alabama, always undisciplined 
What a dumbass
Eject that kid
Wow.  Big call there. Threw a punch should have been gone.
Eject that man 
Hahahahahahaha ha. Our dude was just laughing. Hahahahahahaha. 
good lord that announcer backdrop is ugly
Get him out of the game!
Well damn, there were a few scuffles early in the first half and I guess there's that.
Uh, did something happen? I feel like something happened. 
how the fuck was he not ejected?
That's an ejection ref 
What a fucking idiot 
Can't wait for the off-season Hurts "sweepstakes"
Easily should've been tossed. 
What the fuck, he *should* be thrown out for that horse shit!
with a big interception
How was that not an ejection?
Should have been tossed imo
Imagine Saban chewing you at. Spooky 
The way the ref said “Alabama” like it was a swear 
60 yard drive now. Lol.
I mean he started Tommy, put in Brook, then put Tommy back in #tripleswitch
Throw that fuckface out
Lol get 48 out, fucking classless
Lol the ref saying it like he mad at him
I must''ve missed it, what''s he say about it?
I'm too stressed to think apparently, thanks! 
Sorry but that should be an ejection
Saban takes another scholarship. 
Won't be tomorrow
Do you want to die tonight? You'll never make it through this quarter. 
there's another link in the comments that has commentary.  I don't want to link it because... reasons.
Ha that grin on 84's face
Holy fuck, that's an ejection, isn't it?
How'd he not get ejected?
Me thinks if Georgia does that he''s ejected
Saban is gonna rip that kids head off
That game took place a while ago, the underdog won
Was the pass going to be caught behind the LOS, though?
Poor play in first half 
no this http://www.espn.com/watch/_/id/3267580/sounds-of-the-game-2018-college-football-playoff-national-championship
GET EM OUT 
That's a clear ejection!! Wow 
Will hurts come back?
48 on Bama should be thrown out
Should've been ejected for sure
Dude NO ONE said this lmao
May I introduce you to the University of Oklahoma?
But we have coach Hayden Fox.
Lol the way that Georgia guy smiled
48 on 84 violence needs to stop
48 punches 84
Isn't that an automatic ejection?
His arm is ridiculous. 
Roll tide 
The refs definitely only called that penalty to cover up that it''s all rigged. Right????
Bama losing its cool
That Reaction from 84 ... that was obviously entirely baited.
I've heard desk pen holder
I wouldn''t expect anything less from you.
That didn't warrant an ejection?
Toss him
Should punching a player be an automatic ejection???
ESPN FUCK YOU FOR NOT NOTICING LITERALLY EVERYONE RUNNING TO THE MIDDLE OF THE FIELD BUT INSTEAD JERKING YOUR PERSONALITIES OFF IN THAT SEGMENT
what a dumbass
When tony tells you to chill, you chill. 
How do you not get ejected for that lol 
Alright, sooo... Looks like it wasn't ALL Jalens fault. Our WR's are sucking it up tonight as well.
lol 84 laughing at his dumbass
Crowd goes nuts, announcers just head straight to their talking points 
Throw him out jeez
WOW how the fuck is he in the game still.
Saban gonna need dentures after all the ass he's gonna chew tonight
[deleted]
Yes
Thanks for posting this so I dont have to
Woah he's done
This film room channel with the coaches is awesome
The old bama no class trash
Their line is playing so poorly. Can''t stop anything.
How fucking dumb do you have to be to punch someone?
That's an automatic ejection in the NFL. One of the only things that is
Isn't throwing a punch an ejection?
Sit his dumb ass on the bench 
He gone
Why wasn't he thrown out of the game? 
Saban is pissed.  Dude should have been tossed.  That shit is not needed in the game.
God I love how smart football players are. Punch a guy with a helmet on. They didn''t go there to play school. 
HOLY SHIT CHILL
48 is done
Holy shit
100 Percent ejection if that was a Dawg
Can't throw him out it's bama! /s
THROW HIM OUT 
the look on 84's face says 84 deserved to be hit. 
how is homie not ejected for that? he straight up punched him lmao
BRENT MUUUUSSSSSSBBBBBEEEEEERRRRRGGGGEEEEERRRR! I hate that guy [as a commentator].
Is it not 20-8?
Wow, eject this motherfucker right now.
He threw a punch, he should be gone.
Holy shit a Bama penalty 
what a fuckin bozo
Lol chill 48. Fighting teammates
fuck that guy
That should be an ejection or nah? 
What a fucking idiot
Halftime was like an hour
Lol it almost looks like the refs called a foul on Alabama!   Stream must be messing up. 
My bet is he goes back home to Texas somewhere or FAU because chaos
Have to think Tua gives them the best chance to win.
Wtf is that dudes problem
DID THAT DUDE JUST PUNCH HIS COACH
Hahaha
HE GONE
wow. fuck alabama and fuck these refs. HE FUCKING PUNCHED HIM KICK HIS ASS OUT
And Alabama continues to be dirty as fuck. Not shocking at all 
Other streaming services do not have anywhere the amount of volume ESPN has to deal with.
it is some requiem's "dies irae" - it's clearly inciting some wrath here.
Hmmmm maybe 
Is a punch not an automatic ejection?
Did he just punch a coach?
What is it with us and players named Brown?
WEW LAD
Trashy little shit. Eject him
Get your, get your, get your head in the game
Oh shit. Did he just go after a coach?
That ref seemed personally insulted by that unsportsmanlike conduct lol.
eyy thanks
Is he serious 
#48 is a FUCKING IDIOT
And Brown disappeared never to be seen again.
No ejection? 
When Tony Brown is trying to calm you down, you know you done goofed.
48 is a moron.
Check the Coaches Loser Lounge on watch ESPN
TIL you can punch a player in the face and not get ejected. Wow. I did NOT know that
what is 48s deal, eject his ass
He should be out of the game holy shit!!
Show the fight cmon
Lol wtf
How is that not an ejection lmao 
i'll never not be amazed by players punching another player in the helmet.
Haha the implosion is starting...
Should be fucking ejected. What an ass clown
Nick Saban ain't about to lose two national title games in a row. If he has to kill Hurts to win this game he will lol 
So far so good 
OSUComing from a PSU fan
Lol then he tries to fight his coach.
48 lost his mind.
Should be UCF vs Georgia for a real game, Bama is outclassed.
Saban is going to eat that dude's family
Yeah fuck you Bama guy
Brown having a hissy fit even on the sidelines
How is he not ejected for throwing a punch! 
wtf, dude bro calm down, lol
It gives me the feels when it does
SUBSCRIBE 
Idiot is done for the night. 
Alabama continues to play uncharacteristically stupid football. So many dumb penalties (and many more that were not even called). Something about UGA has them playing VERY undisciplined.  
For fuck's sake ESPN. How hard is it to point the camera at what's happening? They missed so many replays too.
Never seen a Saban team this undisciplined 
Alabama seems to have developed their own set of hairstyles that are passed down each year
Lmao, that ref sounded so disappointed to be calling an unsportsmanlike on Alabama
Damn that dude is falling apart 
It's bad when tony brown pulls you out
sABan hAS LOsT coNtROl OF tHe TIde
Well this stress will be worth it if you win! 
Fuck up your career real quick bruh 
Bye 48!
What the fuck
So Bama has to punch someone in the face to draw a flag
God I hate that bama fight song... Glad they've only played it like twice during the game
48 ON SOME NUT SHIT LMFAO 
Fight!  Lets go to the broadcast booth!
I guarantee anyone on any other team does that shit and they're ejected from the game. 
Brown should be out of the game. Grant's reaction though lol. That reaction reminded me "We've won the mind game"
Send him to the locker room kid is out of control.
WHOA! A penalty on Bama? These refs are clearly biased. 
NICK SABAN HAS LOST CONTROL OF THE TIDE
Did he just go after a coach?
U angry bro?
How the fuck does he not get ejected for that shit?
***Updated Mathematical Score Prediction***Georgia 30.18868 - 15.09434 Alabama
Toss him
This guy a known problem on the sideline bama?
I remember when Bama didn't make stupid penalties. 
What is this guy doing? He should've been ejected for that.  Now he just went after a coach.  edit:is that the same guy who punched an Auburn student after the iron bowl? 
Not good if you want him to stay, he'll prob transfer now. But tua looks like the real deal.
[deleted]
That kid seems like a real douche 
Aren't punches=ejections? Even when bama gets a penalty, they still get away with it 
He gone.
What are these refs thinking, that guy's straight up throwing hands
What just happened???????????
Every time I've watched Georgia I've been impressed with Fromm. seems like dude is going to be a star.
Oh shit! He's done for the day
Another Bama penalty and Saban will turn into a Crimson Hulk 
Lmao him fighting coaches now? What trash. Throw him out. 
48 should be kicked off the team. 
yea....just eject him
#B1GintheSEC
Fluke? He tried to make something out of nothing instead of going down like a man.
How the fuck is he not thrown out?
Dude needs to be ejected
Fighting a coach?
Ummm....  He needs to go to the locker room.
HOW IS THAT NOT AN EJECTION???
I don't understand why these guys can't just go to the sidelines after a play
Still alot of time left. Neither one of these teams will are one to stop competing.
I would not want to fave Saban after getting that penalty 
what is going on over there 
I mean, it's only 11PM. I'm still OK right now.Tomorrow morning might be a different story though.
I switched to the coaches film room stream 1000x better commentary
2 teams dont make a conference. 
Wtf was he going after Saban?
Holy shit, dude has lost his mind on the sideline. 
Bama falling apart
That kid needs to be pulled.
He may have punched a player, but at least he didn't make contact with an official
how do you punch a guy and not get ejected? wow
what the fuck????????? bama on bama crime
The fuck is wrong with you nephew
I'm pretty sure that nobody said that.
He can't throw the ball down field. 
uh, i'm saying you don't risk having less of a lead because you're planning on getting scored on. 
Ejection????????????????
He's off the team. 
Oh dang 48 is bye bye 
HE THREW A FULL BLOWN PUNCH AND WASNT EJECTED
48 should be gone
The Bama offensive line was having trouble before they lost their left tackle. Now they're just getting shredded. 
Wow what a bum
Anyone watching the ESPN Homer stream? It''s pretty enjoyable 
Lol only a Bama player could literally sock someone in the mouth in front of a ref and not get tossed. Saban will send that guy to locker room though 
Hey 48 that's my coach. Get the fuck outta here.
Brown, what the fuck are you doing?
Sideline fight?
Bama falling apart?
48 is fixing to kill someone
Damn 48 going after assistants
Might as well have kicked it outta bounds
That laugh by 84. He was drawing that swat.
What are we thinking?
Yeah he should be tossed tbh
The fuck he doing.
Start attacking your own teammates smh
Oh that bama player is off the team no doubt 
48 just went nuts on the sidelines
This is the 2nd best college football national championship game this year. Actually, didn''t watch the FCS championship game so may be 3rd best. 
OH NO WHAT IS YOU DOING M. BROWN
Did he take a swing at a coach?
What an idiot 
I love it
Refs called that penalty on Bama to help them win, I'm sure.    
What a fucking moron
Enjoy getting kicked off the team 48. 
Angry little fella
DAMN! What a punch 
Nick Saban HAS LOST CONTROL 
Lol
stay classy alabama
The fuck is wrong with that guy. 
Punch the guy with the helmet on... smart
He's gonna fight his own coaches
“He just ends up punching a Georgia player” that made me LOL and idk why
So what's happening on the Bama sideline seems....Bad.
well at least they'll have another runner up trophy to replace the one they smashed ...
Oof not a good look there Mickey Mouse
The best way to beat them is from within...
well then, that''s 2 Alabama players transferring after this game. 
WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT
48 is off the chain
He said number 48 with some snare there.
Some of ya'll acting like this thing is over.Me? I'm just waiting for the exciting finish. *giggity*
He should have been tossed. 
You cost your team 15 yards, lucky to not be ejected, and hurt your own hand hitting someone in the helmet
That dude is crazy 
HAS SABAN LOST CONTROL OF BAMA
THROW HIM OUT!
Melt down on the side line happening now.
That should be an ejection tho 
what the fuck did we just watch someone lose a scholarship haha
Yo did he just try to fight a coach?
Absolute madman 
What's 48 doing on the sideline missed that.
What the fuck is up with Alabama's discipline..Jesus Christ
48 needs to be ejected
Throw him in the Pit of Despair!
Well THAT guy might be off the team. 
Wtf
Dude you''re a special teams player sit the fuck down 
IS HE TRYING TO FIGHT HIS OWN COACH?!?!?
His career is over LOL. Cya!
Holy shit he is mad
How the fuck do the refs see that and not eject him?!
WTF HE TRIED TO PUNCH A COACH BAMA IS LOSING THEIR SHIT
That dude trying to fight his own team??? Kick him off the team now man...wtf
Well done 84 not reacting
How to get benched 101
That boy ain't right
lol
Old ball coach needs to light this asshole up.
BOI WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING
Saban is gonna cut that man's dick off lmao 
Kick that mother fucker outta the game.
Bama is falling apartI repeat, Bama is falling apart
Take him out of the game! Wtf.
Woah
loooool
Just tonight lol
Did 48 just try to swing on his coach? 
This mans just almost hit one of the coaches smh
That guy is fucked 
Kick that kid out
That guy needs to chill the fuck out
[removed]
There's wasn't anything, 2 pushes and everyone backed off to their sidelines.http://www.espn.com/watch/_/id/3267580/sounds-of-the-game-2018-college-football-playoff-national-championshipshowed what happened
Cmon now
Saban isn't even yelling anymore...he's just like...wtf are you doing...
What's up with Brown?
OMG WHO WAS THAT FOR
What a goon. Hits him then backs away too like a baby back bitch
Holy shit. That''s a new one. 
Brown lmao
Wow! That ref sneered 
Holy shit.  That dude is trippin
Brown just punched a coach. 
That dude needs to be cut
BACK THE FUCK UP MEKHI BROWN
Should''ve went with the pile driver.
What? That''s like the first act like that in years, and by a no name back up
>Hurts has regressed in the passing game.Hmm, sounds like one of our quarterbacks.And I noticed the name Daboll coming up a lot in the thread, usually negatively.
Send that shithead to the showers
Shit did 48 just shove his own teammates now?
How tf are you gonna hurt someone with a punch if they're wearing a helmet
You know 84 had to be talking MASSIVE amounts of shit for that
holy shit
Great way to break your hand 
LMAOOOOO that guys outta here real quick 
I don't think 48 is going to be on the team tomorrow ...
Was 48 going to go after Saban?????
He's mad
Wtf sitdown
It's also about the only stream that is working.
Saban should send that kid to the locker room if the refs won't
Am I the only one disappointed with how sloppy and ugly this game is? It''s supposed to be the two best teams not...whatever the hell this is.....
"they'll send police over there wont they" fucking give me a break
Holy shit lmaooo 
Is that Migos 
Saban molding young men
How is he still...How is he still on the *sidelines* now?
Send him to the fucking locker room 
whoa.... I never see that shit happen live
Throwing punches at their own coaches? How fucking stupid can you be 
Nice job 48 now you will never play another down for Bama again after hitting a coach
When tony brown is there to tell you you're an idiot you know you fucked up.  
What the fuck is 48''s problem? Jesus.
Don't let him play, Saban. Come on don't give them more reasons to hate us
Wooooow. Not a good look
He just went after Saban!
48 needs to go to the lockerroom holy shit
Woah, that''s an ejection, man. 
That boy needs a timeout
Did anyone else see Bamas linemen way downfield on their last third down play?
#48 needs to fucking chill
48 needs to be outta there
Neither of these teams would beat Clemson (/s)
Have you watched Jalen Hurts play meaningful games against tough opponents?  Team record doesn't mean player is good.  
Hes about to be thrown out by his own team
Apparently not.
Looks like the only lefty QB in the NFL is [a backup for Dallas](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/are-lefty-quarterbacks-going-extinct/)
LOL HOW WAS BROWN NOT THROWN OUT
FIGHT!!!
Dude, calm your tits jeez
Wow, 48 is fucking stupid!
Bama''s missed FG starting to be a big deal.
Calms down bruh
Not outside the realm of possibility
Eh he looks decent at best
Take his helmet. What a cock 
Well guess he's off the team
Going after the coach? What the fuck
he was goin after another bama player lol, georgia just got in the way
Leave 48 on the tarmac
48 is gonna get ejected 
Get that negativity out of here
CTE
The Goggles kicker from UGA is legit. All-American since 6th grade pop warner football.
/r/earlycelebration
Bye Felicia.
lol wtf this moron going after a coach?
 Wow fighting the coach though! 
Send that boy to the locker room Saban
Jeez, what a douche. That kid shouldn't see another snap all game.
Lolololoooo that was the funniest thing I''ve ever seen 
wowwww lol cool it guy
they look so flat, almost unprepared.
48 ain't going to play. He went after a coach.
Throw his punk ass out of the game.
Refs throw him out of the game?  Hell, his own coach should do it!
WTFI've **never** seen a player try to hit a coach like that that's fucked up
Brown should've been tossed. But he's definitely not going to see the field now lol
This kid a damn moron 
How did he not get thrown out?
Y I K E S
Bama could pitch a 24-0 shut out and some of the die hards would find plays that meant we stole the game. But I agree with your analysis. Looking like it won't be a factor.
That kid just lost his scholarship
I know testosterone and emotions are flying but is it really that not to just like, not punch someone.
Live outside the US and don't have access to a decent stream online, but want yall to know your comments are a way better way to experience the game than any commentator I've heard on tv for a championship game
He gone. Bama #48 needs to calm down
WELL, 48 ain''t playing the rest of the game
48 bout to get thrown out
Look at Bama, clearly paying the refs to make strategic calls against them to throw off any cries of collusion.
Boi you done got rekt by your own coach
He was fighting his own coach. Dang
What a clown
48 likes walking into glass doors
Sideline antics and going after a coach on the sideline says he should be ejected too.
Should have been ejected, then tries to hit his coach.. Fuck off classless child.
OH SHIT that dude just fucked himself so hard lmao 
That guy is an idiot
Settle down kid. You''re night is done. 
WTF was that ?!
Where's all the guys that were saying they weren't watching the game today? I wonder if they're hanging out in here, trying their hardest to not turn on the TV. 
Brown sure seems like a great team player!
mine is streaming well  http://www.espn.com/watch/_/id/3267580/sounds-of-the-game-2018-college-football-playoff-national-championship    it might ask for provider, but if you refresh it should work
#48 is a moron.
keep being a punk 48.   Saban will definitely let u back in the game.
only the best and brightest at alabama
The next blood sacrifice has been chosen
This might be the dumbest Natty I have ever watched.
My mom says Fromm looks like Zac Efron
Damn this guy is having a meltdown
Yeah, don''t throw him out for a punch or anything. It''s cool. 
Bama going full Pat's? 
What?
HAS SABAN LOST CONTROL
DOUG, KICK HIM OFF THE TOUR!
What an absolute bitch. Sucks I can't see him come back in and get leveled
That was dumb. 
That kid is done
Oh my god 
It's bama
Throw him out.
Lol take a swing at the guys on your sideline, what a chump
Cry me a river punk 
Well that guy is off the team
Lol how is that not an ejection 
Fucking idiot. 
What a nice guy
Fowler:  send him to prison!
Whaaaaaat a penalty against Bama? But they never make penalties...
no, no, you misunderstand. Everyone knew Bama and UGA were good it's everyone else that sucks. But hey, thanks for beating Michigan and giving the B1G a perfect 7-1 record. 
He actually went after Saban?!?!  He should start looking for a new school.
That''s a good way to get kicked off the team
Send his bitchass to the locker room. 
I bet Saban wishes he has Alex “Heisman” Hornibrook right about now
Punching someone with a helmet on? Fucking dumb. And that's ignoring the ramifications on the game.
In what way? I fail to see how they (or cheerleaders for that matter) are important to the thing happening on the pitch...
Yeah he's getting kicked off the team 
Dirty as fuck. Should be ejected. 
48 going to the locker room early
he gone
Quality GA's calming that guy down.
If you think this game is good... you should watch the regular season.
They aren't thinking. 
Class by the Georgia player just turn around and laugh
I thought they could only call penalties on Georgia? 
Wtf is with Bama? They''re usually calm and collected in this scenario. What''s with the immaturity?Sabans pact wearing off?
LOCK HIM UP, LOCK HIM UP
he snapped
If Kansas had Tom Brady as quarterback hoe many games would they win
Kirby Smart took all the voodoo magic. 
what an idiot
They are on dat ass
Was he flipping out at a coach?
Alabama is imploding. 
God that dude's a little bitch 
I suspect the Alabama staff will do what the officials didn't and keep 48 from playing again.
Trying to fight his own guys!!! Oh shit
Shoves a trainer too, what a bitch
Trying to fight his own coach wtf.
this kid has lost his mind lol
he gone
Someone needs to put a trollface on that. 
Call me and I'll commentate for you
THIS KID IS A FUCKING IDIOT.You gonna fight your coach now?! Dumbass
Send his ass to the showers. Better yet, straight to the bus. 
did he just hit a coach? goddamn
Never seen a man happier to get punched
We got them flustered 
What an idiot, Saban gonna chew him out a shit ton.
Hypothetical:You switch from a right handed QB to a lefty after the conference championship. You have a few weeks to prepare for bowl season. Conventional knowledge says that your left tackle is better than your right - do you move him to the right side of the line so he can stay on the blind side?
Bama
Somebodys head is out of the game...
Hope 48 is enjoying his last game as a member of Alabama. 
Holy shit Saban is going to consume his soul calm down child 
Alabama morale is at an all time low.
Cut that dipshit.
Punches a guy wearing a helmet. Smart 
Send him to the locker room. 
That guy's probably getting ejected from Saban himself
rip career
What a fucking idiot
If Mike Houston was the coach that guy wouldn't be playing the rest of the game.
Chubb is struggling.
A 3 and out here gives Bama all the momentum
probably done for good with bama
Unironically this.
Watch the Data Center steam...you trade some real estate for radio commentary.
What a fucking asshat
What was that guy pissed about? 
Ever seen someone's draft stock plummet through the earth on a kickoff/sideline?
Welp, #48 is gonna be running the stadium for the next three years
Seems like a good guy 
Cut him. He doesn''t belong anywhere near a football field
Did he just go after a coach?
that''s how you lose your place on the team
Or not and he'll push a coach lol
Somebody post a vid of that mad lad punching the coach 
Take that boy off the field. 
RUMBLE YOUNG MAN RUMBLE
Oh snap!
Yes, and he's done pretty well.
That guy is hella salty 
Did he just start a fight with his own bench?
Starting shit on your own sideline in the National Championship, good head on this one
“Yes, let me go after my own coach.”
BAMA FIGHT ON THE SIDELINE
Congratulations. You played yourself 
How stupid can you be!?
Whew, glad I'm flying out to NYC tomorrow instead of today.  Don't think I could stay up if I was on the East Coast.
He gone
84 is an equal scumbag for whatever shit he said.Just play football.
Have fun at EMCC 48
Maybe lay off the Roids 48
Oh shit
Well #48 Will never start
I missed it. What happened?
the guys who talk outta the sides of their mouths always have emotional issues
FUCKING EJECT HIS ASS
dawgs cmon 
I''m ready to punch through my screen. I tried two Roku TVs and my laptop and it''s not me it''s their goddamn stream. It''s cutting out every 15 fucking seconds.
Which coach?
No joke he looks fucking furious
48 is showing his true colors here. He's not getting back in the game regardless of not getting ejected there.
wow saban coached teams usually are well disciplined.... that 48 is a straight up loose cannon 
The kind of discipline and decision making you would expect from a guy with islands for sideburns
Wait, how is straight up throwing a punch at someone not ejection-worthy?
Wow. Trying to fight a coach on the sidelines?!
going after your own coach......nice
Put that dude in the locker room.
Got to take advantage of this field position.How was he not thrown out for that?!
Lol what an idiot
Nick Saban has lost control?
Haven''t for years and won''t again. 
Saban might murder that guy.
I think I''d rather punch my mom in the face than suffer a Nick Saban glare of disappointment. 
Lol wtf that dude should be ejected 
annddd he's cut
These refs are fucking trash. Seriously 
did you see that?  someone on bama just got kicked off the team
NELLIE MCKAY IS THE GREATEST RAPPER OF ALL TIME.
Nah it makes it fun
Did he seriously just try to throw on his own coach?
BRO GO BACK TO THE PUNCH. I DIDNT WANT TO SEE THOSE TWO OLD FARTS TALKING.
#48 gonna get cut?
Yeah he needs to be kicked off the team for that. Embarrassing.
YO WTF R U DOING BROWNSTOP FIGHTING YOUR OWN TEAM
48 has some gross ass sideburns lmao
throw that dude in the locker room asap. unbelievable. 
Son of a bitch. We don't need this Jersey Shore bullshit.
Kirk, don't act like you just knew that dude was from 1985
Yeah
Mark Richt has lost control of 48. 
Dude is trying to fade the entire building. Send him to the locker room. 
Ugh Chubb just having a poor night...
Lock Him Up!
That's a great way to end your football career#COME AT ME COACH!! 
Yeah, keep running your mouth after your whole own team told you to fuck off, see how far that gets you.
Wtf, did he just try to go after his coach?
Did he go for a coach?
That kid is hot trash
Throws a punch and then throws a shove on his own sideline. Dude needs to go to the locker room. 
The roids are kicking in!
OH DAMN
so is 48 as much of a piece of shit as he looks right now?
Was he just going after a coach?
Has Chubb even got back to line of scrimmage when he tries to bounce it back outside
Georgia has Alabama right where they want them...Third and long.
Fuck y''all 
WHY DO PEOPLE PUNCH GUYS WHO ARE WEARING HELMETS?!?!
Complete psycho move going after a coach
this idiot just ruined his career
Saban had lost control of his players
Not when you play for Alabama and you're losing in the second half, apparently.
Chill
42 just flexed on 48
Saban is going to fucking kill that man first day of practice if he''s on the team
should be an ejection 
Yep. Only class at Bama 
Please have 22 players named Brown on the field next year. 
That dude needs to sort his shit out
What just happened? 
Dipshit. I love the other Bama guy's reaction though "wtf is wrong with you"
Well 48 is headed to the locker room
Who was 48 going after on the sideline?
Chubb needs to stop trying to bounce outside. 
Lol wtf is that dumbass doing
He just trash talked his way into 15 yards, I'd be smiling too. 
You wanna know what is worse?  That shit that other school plays.  They are north of Texas and I can't stand that song.
College football has such a turnover of players team experience is not that important.
Man what has 48 so fired up? He''s still pissed. 
Did he just go after a coach!?
He just pushed that lady on the sidelines
geez. go home, dude. You know it's bad when Tony Brown has to intervene to keep you in line.
TO DAVY JONES LOCKEROOM
Going off on your coaches in the national championship. As a backup player.Fucking idiot.
did he just get punched by that coach?
Bye bye baby
Were getting 20k comments
[deleted]
except it wasn't brown....
Was thinking that as I typed it.
Kick 48 off the team
He''s mad that the rest of his facial hair won''t grow in
Holy shit they player just tried to fight a coach.That actually just happened.
Send that dude to the showers.
If Tony Brown is calming you down, you fucked up
No he is from Bama
He just said the complexion of this game has changed for Alabama.Was just making a stupid joke lol
That dude didn''t actually just try to attack his coach right? Jesus
Oooo he mad
That kinda attitude will get you kicked off the team
Let's lock 48 off the team. I'm all for that right now
WHY THE FUCK IS GEORGIA STILL RUNNING OUTSIDETHEY HAVE BEEN WAY MORE SUCCESSFUL BETWEEN THE TACKLES 
Bama Dude is upset
What''s the rationale behind him not getting tossed?
Did he just try to fight a coach?! Or am I imagining things?!
Lmao 48, what the fuck is you doin??
Somebody restrain that man, he''s about to explode
48 my dude...
48's a backup, huh? Why am I not surprised
For the love of God Chaney run Sony on the first two downs instead of Chubb
Auburn, step right up???
rewind and look at 84's face after he got punched, 84 deserved it.  84 knew he had a helmet on though, get rid of helmets and problem solved. 
well 48's never playing for Bama again
Holy shit was 48 seriously about to fight his own teammates?
What the fuck is wrong with this guy?
I'm sorry. Did he just punch a coach?
HAS SABAN LOST CONTROL???? LOLOLOLOLOLOL
Congratulations 48 you probably just cost yourself millions in the draft you hot-headed punk.
And 48''s career is probably down at Bama. Congrats 
Oh no #48 is not making good life choices
How has Bama not even kicked him off their sideline yet? 
Bye 48
That guy is not gonna be back next year. 
Man Chubb is just not getting anything going
He just ruined his life. He just lost his scholarship and any chance at ever playing for Alabama again.
Holy shit ESPN has no mercy, camera focused on Brown lmao. 
Someone Woody Hayes that boi
He needs his ass send home. Thats unacceptable
CFB wins. Because that means 8 team playoff.
Fromm is also a freshman. Doesn''t really matter though, being a freshman doesn''t mean he''s immune to playing too fast. He needs to settle in there 
For sure, but I don''t know if I can take another hour of this...
Some Alabama kid just tried to punch his coach on the sideline. WTF is going on.
The fuck is wrong with him
48 lol
Alabama losing their shit on the sidelines, pure bliss.
Lol Bamas sideline
You are on the SPECIAL TEAMS UNIT. You are about the last person that can get away with a personal fouls.
Kick him off the team for that shit.
 #firesaben
u high bro?
Is Alabama fighting each other now!?
get 48 off the fucking field. throwing punches at the other team and now at people on his own sidelines
How do you punch someone and not get tossed?
Why are the Packers playing in this game and why are they Red 
Hahaha #48 is done.
He tried to punch one of them lol what an idiot 
I think just having a bit of a meltdown not necessarily yelling at him.
Great way to break your career
Fuck that guy. He just pushed that female assistant. Hope he never sees the field again.
How the FUCK did he not get ejected?!
I missed it, what happened with #48
That''s not an automatic ejection how? If the Alabama coaching staff has any self-respect he''ll be headed to the locker room. 
The officiating is so God Damned bad. It's hard to watch and I don't even have a team in the fight.
so does he submit his transfer papers before or after the 4th quarter starts
That was funny
Dude should ride pine all night for that. 
Dude WHAT? Did he just swing at a coach? 
OH MY GOD HOW DO YOU MAKE THAT DECISION IN THE NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP 
Future EMCC star Mekhi Brown
Bye bye dumbass 
bama's done
Sideline reporter: “Hey Hertz how does it feel to be benched by a freshmen in the National Championship” Jalen: “It''s Hurts” Sideline Reporter: “Yeah I''d imagine it does. Welp folks you heard it here first Jolan Holts is in emotional anguish as an unproven rookie takes over his team in what might possibly be the biggest game of his life” Jalen: “You know I''m still here right” Sideline Reporter: “Of course you are Halls, it''s not like you''re going on the field anytime soon” 
Might  not make it back to Tuscaloosa after that 
I''m on a keto diet right now but I''m seriously considering popping some popcorn. 
Stop running Chubb 
This game is not built for Chubb... why do we keep running him inside
Ooooohhh sporting some tude 
[deleted]
Ayyy welcome to the cult! Feel free to grab your complimentary Nike t shirt and dime bag 
Dang the kid that got punched was so calm about it
Ice cream machine at McDonald's wasn't down tonight during half time lol 
He didn't come to play school
DiScIpLiNeD SaBaN TeAm!¡!¡
DID HE JUST PUNCH A COACH
Lol why is 48 still in this game?
lmao wtf
I want to know why that guy is so mad.
OH MY
Agree. No room for that. You wanna act like a child, get treated like one... Be a grown ass man.
48 is also considering his transfer decision because Saban will never play his ass again
He's 20?
Brown should never wear crimson again. 
Yeah wtf was that
That Bama player isn''t gonna play another down of football in his life
This game is going to ruin my NoFap
Sorry, what was the sideline interference?
Nice way to get yourself kicked off the team.
So uhh, that kids a little too hot, idk how he's not ejected
Damn who was he going after on the sideline? 
Someone link me a replay of 48''s shenanigans 
What happened to Hurts?  Why is he out?
Don''t think Brown is gonna be on the field anytime soon
he mad
DANG. 48 IS THE REALEST MOTHERFUCKER OUT THERE
Alabama actually has more penalties haha
Looks like a spot just opened up on the Alabama team. No way Saben doesn't follow that up.
They are all 5 stars
So stupid but I like it 
We have Martell and Burrow too if Haskins doesn''t work out 
Welp, he just fucked himself out of a scholarship
Is that the time out chair? 
When you recruit someone who has the brain the size of a peanut you get this. What a fucking idiot. 
Don''t matter if he stabbed someone on the sidelines, as long as he''s playing decent Saban won''t care
I think they just spent their shot emotionally against us. They overhyped it. 
i mean, you never plan on getting scored on. but you always have to think of all the possible scenarios. 
48 is acting like a damn child
And then you start running the ball... don''t try to run. Keep throwing it.
Did he really take a shot at a coach?
Mekhi just killed his chances of playing at bama for a while
Moron.
Your down ten points. What the fuck are you doing getting an attitude!
Wait did \#48 try to fight a coach?
Good.  Bama assholery on a national stage.  
48 acting like a manbaby from last chance u
YOUUU CANNT DOOO THATTT!
I would kick 48 off the team if I was Saban. Biggest game of the year and he's going after coaches on the sidelines.
There is discord within the Bama empire
Yep
Gif of that manbaby getting mad at the Alabama coach
48 is so done
Fucking hell, the true freshman circle jerk is strong.
The Homers broadcast just turned into a found footage movie with the guy on camera chasing down something crazy happening
Low IQ bama player 
Punch thrown? Get to play the rest of the game. Incidental helmet to helmet contact on a legal hit initiated by the offense? Defensive player immediately ejected for targeting. 
Yes, yes he did.
I think NYT had an article where Saban said he doesn't try to build around star QBs, just guys who can get it done and let the rest of the team win. 
What? The man who discovered North America died that year! RIP Lief Erickson.It's even worse if you are talking BC, because that's the year Troy was destroyed. What's your problem dude?
I don't care what team this is. You're in a national title game and you just threw a punch then took a run at a coach? Fuck off. 
Did he just throw a punch at a coach?!
That boy needs a snickers 
I get that players get emotional and what not but you gotta get that guy out of there 
Kick that dumb bitch out of here, no discipline you dumb pos.
I don't think I've ever Seen a player attack his own coach on the sideline before. 
UGA gets a sideline penalty for being overjoyed. Bama player punches a dude then goes after a coach & is still on the sideline. Lawl
Did he try to go after a coach??
Well, he''ll be looking for somewhere to play next fall.
Sure did
we not here to play school
EVERYONE IS A TRUE FRESHMAN
I'm getting that vibe from the responses. The big one for me is Hurts regressing as a passer (i.e. like J.T. Barrett).
Tell me who should have been above them?
byby scholarship 
should be gone
Yeet
That is embarrassing for Alabama
THEY AINT SMRT
That boy needs therapy 
OHHHH SHIT, #48 of AL just tried to hit an AL coach on the sideline, and he's still fuming
That's how you get kicked off the team kids. Go after a coach and push a lady out of the way. Yikes
The Bama collapse BAHAHAHAH
They're not sending their best folks
How do you not get kicked out of the game for throwing a punch?
Bama is done. Completely lost control of the players. Composure gone. Coaches talking shit to players, players punching GA guys, this is sad.
I can't believe these two teams lost to fucking Auburn
NICK SABAN HAS LOST CONTROL OF BAMA!
Saban has lost control of Alabama
I'll never get attempting to punch a dude in the facemask... Like what will you even accomplish?
hope he didn't need his scholarship
Brown just keepin it real
He''s getting his endorsements taken away 
Nick Saban just found his pre-fourth-quarter sacrifice.
48's gonna be at a JuCo real fast
Man, credit to #84 for handling that well. Took the hit and just walked off to let the refs call it. Heads-up there. 
Lol 48 is a dumbass. LOL!!
Best ridley 
huge 3rd down catch
Caught it out of the corner of my eye, did he swing at a coach??
It''s tradition 
How fucking stupid do you have to be to throw away a football scholarship at alabama because of some petty bullshit?
Go after a coach, I'm sure all the players on your team around you will be on your side and not the coaches
Wow. Did that player just try to hit his coach?
Riley > Calvin
Imma need a gif of Brown swinging at his coach plz 
Send that idiot back to locker room
christ you're a bonehead
#special# teams
Probably won't get drafted either when NFL scouts see that attitude.
Greyhound 
Helmet v. Fist, Helmet wins every time
what a selfish dumbass
Aaaaaand that''s how you get sent to EMCC
Damn. Just went after Saban?!?
It's sneaky, just like you'd expect from Saban.
I never understood when players to that. At least go for a body shot.
\>100 yards rushingbarely moving the ball on the ground
48 gonna end up on the side of the road near emcc.
Get this fake tough guy out of here. 
What set 48 off I looked away?
HAHAHAHAHAH ALABAMA COMMENTATORS TOTALLY IGNORED THAT FRIENDLY FIRE HAHAHHAHHA
I think Saban just announced #48's transfer.
Yes.
Mark Richt has lost control of #48.
NFL scouts gonna love that
Woody Hayes punched a player and he got kicked out of football.
Wow, I've never seen Alabama meltdown like this, ever.
Is that a beard on Brown lol 
This kid is ridley ridley good tho
EZ
Brethren on watch ESPN who are pissed at this stream - switch over to the sounds of the game stream it''s much better
For real it hurts so bad and doesn''t do anything 
Did he just punch a coach and player?
great throw Fromm
Give it to Michel. Chubb isn''t getting shit today.
Yes...
Tua looks good, real good for a true freshman 
48 is NOT a stable genius.
Incidentally I love, love, loved the Georgia player's reaction to 48's punch. He knew he got the penalty, and that was all he needed. Walked away with a smile on his face.
He''s not gonna be playing next year.
How can it be unsportsmanlike conduct if it's conduct done by a sportsman
I don''t see how GA keeps converting on third down, but I''ll take it. 
Never sees the field again? Dude cmon lol chill 
[turrible](https://i.imgur.com/KP3h8uZ.png)
UGA so far back from the sideline now lol
Good on 84 for walking away. This is, top to bottom, our most embarrassing outing of the season. 
I''m starting to really like this 
Riley Ridley is clearly the better brother. 
Coach too. 
UCF > Clemson also. 
^That's ^what ^I'm ^saying. ^^Alabamapaysmore.
Little bro for the win!
Need to get the running game going here.  Control the clock and get a score.
Fromm is the next Aaron Rodgers 
fucking moron should be ejected. what an idiot.
Punched a dawg in the face
They losin control over on Alabama's sideline huh
That kid has the worst "beard" i have ever seen, it's just like long chops that don't connect 
My farts smell like eggs
Called that.
Brown,#48, just lost his scholarship. 
You can't just explode like that in the biggest game 
What a pos 48 is
What was going on in that sideline?
Number 48 is pissed and trying to explain how UCF won the championship
Little Ridley taking the family torch tonight
Saban about to murder #48
I think they said self police not send police
These fans so fucking loud I love it Maggle
I'd be surprised if that dude sees the field again holy shit
What the fuck dude
Little brothers do it better.
Blankenship (UGA K) is a really good soccer player.
Outside of Oklahoma, I feel like among the top teams this has been a good year for defenses and a down year for offenses.
48 is going to kill it on Last Chance U
Shitty ass secondary, god awful.
How is everyone else's stream? I'm on Sling and it is stuck in low def most of the time, but no lag or interruptions.
That just happened
I like your flair
Did riley steal calvins power space jam style?
Holy shit Fromm has an arm
I didn't see what happened. What did he do?
Consider the person - last year he replaced his offensive coordinator a week before 
Alabama players are angry they broke the 2nd place trophy just to get another one.
T R U E  F R E S H M A N
Just mad that Gucci Mane wasn't the halftime performance
another great throw from jake
Especially since he pretty much did have a game winning drive last year, Watson just pulled a miracle out. I don't like bama but that's gotta suck for him
*Clap clap clap-clap-clap*
48 has just made an ass of himself on the biggest stage he'll ever be on. 
That guy just literally threw away his career
Same hahaha really didn't expect that 
Yeah I don''t know if I''ve ever seen anything like that
Not sure. But the dude he punched had a huge smirk on his face. I'm sure it was good old fashioned shit talk.
Send that clown back to the locker room. 
Can anyone tell me what year this quarterback is?
Did someone say Little Brother?
What a baby.
Shake that thang Jake the Shake!
He's gonna get kicked off the team 
 You mean The Shadow Realm
You're right... I exaggerated 
Georgia is winning this game by converting key third downs. 
Secret Weapon Ridley is a go.
Fromm is very good at progressing through his reads
His career at Bama should be.
Michel needs to just take ever handoff in the 4th quarter.
Thats what im saying. 84 had a shit eating grin after that
Looked like he was going after the assistant there
Welcome! Better late than never
Good thing for 48 that the Alabama coaching staff has a high tolerance for shit like this. Oh. Also did anyone see him push that female trainer?
Fromm is like a better version of AJ McCaron.
simply amazing!
Levi Wallace is GAHBAGE 
I love how big the crew is for Georgia for keeping eveyone on the sideline. 
I was under the impression the punch was enough to do that.
What a fucking child. 
whose mans is bamas
Nice discipline there you shitstain
Some Freak Friday shit going on with the Ridley brothers 
Naw he''s transferring tomorrow lol to Auburn
Less consequence because you're not really gonna hurt the other person.
Last Chance U
Nick Saban has lost control of the Bama sideline!!!
NICK SABAN HAS LOST CONTROL
Should lose a scholarship for that shit. 
Wow what the hell is wrong with 48
Why can't they get to Fromm? Fucker is automatic on 3rd down. 
Seconded 
He was smiling. Ha.
Tried that once in lacrosse. Can confirm it has no effect.
Brown is going to regret that shit for the rest of his life. 
I mean every damn time. 3rd down and a GA WR is wide open 
and all of r/cfb collectively orgasms watching bama implode  
Wanna lose a scholarship? There you go..
Lol this kid needs to chill
C O L L A P S E
Man little bro is stepping up 
I just now started drinking
Ref needs to call holding
Pretty fucking stupid.
Bruised hand idk 
To be fair that is most major college football players.
48 just ruined his career right there
which coach was he going for??
“Bama”
48 gonna get a Sub-Zero style finishing move from Saban if he don't calm the F down.
It''s the nattyMost people kill for this opportunity And you punch a coach and get yourself removed from the game and probably kicked from the team... dumb fucking ass
Whoa, bud swingin at your coach is a *bad* idea.
He needs to be pulled holy shit
Take a shot every time they talk about the Ridley brothers age difference. 
8-20 First downs wow
Fourth Quarter surprise: Nick Saban pulls off his mask to reveal he''s been Mark Richt all along 
Wait those guys are brothers?????
Man, you had a better chance rattling David Greene than you do Jake Fromm
Still going onthe sidelines. Sit down and chill out you moron
Hey guys where''s that turn over chain at?How about a penalty flag chain!?
Crazy. When a Bama player hits a ball carrier, they go down. Wonder what that's like.
Jake Fromm is balling the fuck out. 
Ah I see, knowing Herb you never know thoughIt''s not a stupid joke 
Look how far back the Georgia players and coaches are lol. They''re not taking any more BS sideline penalties
\#48's application for the next "When Keeping It Real Goes Wrong" segment has been accepted.
Screw the game, can we watch my team fall apart on the sidelines guys? Looks like a good ass kicking is brewing over there.
Lol my mom texted me that #48 needs his own get back coach
If Saban lets that stupid fucker play after that
The college football fan in me wants Alabama to lose but the saints fan in me wants georgia to just have no nice things at all
He's transferring to Tulane now. 
Dude's gonna want to learn to get that second foot down
Yes.  The difference in this game is definitely QB play..
Haha 39 AGAIN. HE CANNOT COVER
[removed]
damn, that was some composure
Have yourself a game, Riley Ridley!
What are you saying Lol he tried to throw it and bounced off the helmet and got picked. Thats a flukey INT
Saban may wanna sacrifice 48 to win this game now
Was he going for Lord Saban without first destroying all 7 horcruxes? 
Bamas having some sideline drama
Jeezus, Fromm is terrifying.
B1G refs prep in the streets.  They're down with a little swing.
**#48 JUST COST ALABAMA A NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP**
Where were you when Mekhi Brown's Bama career was ended
Conference hate took over 
AS GAWD AS MY WITNESS THAT COACH IS BROKEN IN HALF
Ridley family Christmas dinner going to be lit next year
Falling over in coverage has not worked for us tonight. Maybe we'll figure that out next season.
Is that AJ Green back out there for Georgia?
They won't if he is any good
“I''m just so angwy!”
*dumbest
He's such a fucking robot. Just parrots the color commentary bullshit that Herbstreit says. Adds absolutely nothing of value.
Did that dude just try to hit his coach?
[deleted]
I heard this kid might be a true freshman--anyone know if that's true?
Looked like one of the coaches or assistants! 
really fucking stupid
‘Bama
Well Bama should have never been here sooooooo
Civil war!!!
Just don't be surprised if 48 falls off the face of the earth.
I feel like Michel is jsut a cheat code for an instant 4 yards
seconded
3-8 21 yards first half. seems like a knee jerk reaction from Coachie Saban though. Is he your starter? Let him finish .. ??
The cameras following angry Brown around is like watching The Real World: CFP
I get fighting with your teammates, but you never touch your coach, man.
Saban gonna allow that shit on his sideline?
Riley Ridley is definitely here to show up his brother
Do it
As Boondocks was said famously  "Riley wuz here."
Did he get ejected?
Saban just let him know he won't be on the team  next year. 
He gonna cry in the car. 
It was Legarette Blunt level lol
Watch this game for only $9.99
You and me both. I have faith that he will make it to the NFL and shine though, and I will become a fan of wherever he lands. 
These Georgia receivers are playing on another level
YOO HE JUST SWUNG ON A COACH 
how to get benched in the National Championship game and kicked off the team in 45seconds
Haha look at the wall of coaches blocking players on the sideline
Accelerated CTE
there we go sony, solid run blocking
Meltdown mode. Was it a female assistant or trainer?
RIP 48s career at bama
*WHEN KEEPING IT REAL GOES WRONG...*
Just run twice. Then convert on third. 
I did.
Fromm has been far from perfect, but you see some of these throws he makes, and it blows my mind this dude is a freshman.
That boy done 
Jeez these 2 espn idiots reaaaaaaallly want bama to win. This is ridiculous. 
Should have already happened
STATE IN DEEP SOUTH. WAKE UP AND PASS THE SHINE
Or Michel runs it
Top schools recruit the best hs kickers. The kids go to camps and are ranked by those camps/organizations. Look up Chris sailer kicking for an example.
Punched a GA guy then tried to fight a coach on the sideline it looked like.
When have the Pats ever lost control like that? They've had verbal but never a player throwing a punch at a coach LOL and it was usually just Brady bitching at the OC.
I mean, I'm 27, shes very.. caring..
What the fuck, put 48 back in the locker room.
Did #48 just assault one of his coaches?
You only need 1 foot in in college?
When keeping it real goes wrong
Dilly dilly!
keeping it real childish
When keeping it real goes wrong...
>run Sony on the first two downs instead of SonyWho instead of who, now?
Anyone know what position that m Brown is ? 
These 3rd downs are killing us.
WE ARE FREAKING CATACLYSMICALLY BAD ON THIRD DOWN!
I love it
A teammate. 
Oh no, 48, what is you doin'' baby?
48 didn't swing at Saban did he?
I think 48 dude is upset about something
If saban needs to sacrifice through blood of someone for the Natty, it will be 48.
"they're going to get the police"
Punching isn't a ejection now?
Alabama can't force a fourth down to save their season.
Lmao The Real Ridley
Yes it appeared like it.Also your flair is hurting my soul.
Right? Pretty sure he was smiling 
They must have some reason to be keeping it bad
it''s a mutiny!
Yes
Riley Ridley be like "My literal, actual brother who?"
Fuck whoever the fuck that player is punching a player and a coach. Kick his bitch ass of the team. 
I want Bama to lose now because of no. 48
Wow how embarrassing of Brown. Alabama looks moronic in this game and did not deserve to make it. They beat the 1 seed from the ACC... can''t even beat a team that played a more challenging schedule this season (and one more game than them).
Are we sure the Ridleys didn't swap places as a joke?
Performance
Y'all see how far back UGA sideline is? They're like 3 yards back
Why don't they just keep passing?
Good view of it on the coach''s room
He punched the dude in the helmet yo
Blood sacrifice is required
Did you guys know the Ridley brothers are both playing?!?
Watching without commentary. WTF happened with Brown?
keep Michel in
East Mississippi CC material
Aw son of a bitch
Same
love the fact that the bands have been playing basically nonstop
Alabama exposed. Clemson exposed. Playoffs should have been Georgia, Oklahoma, Wisconsin, and UCF.
Bama's garbo on 3rd down
Fromm is legit.
Yup. Sure did
Can you be ejected for attacking your own coach?
...uh sorry?
In the top right of your screen, does it say "sounds of the game?"
decent run, need more of those please
Worse than Bowlwares with no stache? 
When keepin it real goes wrong.
That would been so exciting if that kid punched his coach
That guys never seeing the field again. Any nfl shot he just blew
Has Satan forsaken Saban?!?
Bama's playing itself
Coach them to be savages then get pissed when they act like one
Don't want to lose the security deposit on the locker room if he destroys it
48 just tried to fight saben
A player got mad at a coach and practically attacked him. The other players had to hold him back. 
Dude went after a coach/staff and another player saved his spring semester for him
Huh. Thanks for that.
High protein diet?
Seriously. He''d be in the locker room getting undressed right now
Do it man, you deserve it
Bama just can't get off the field on 3rd down.
in that guy's case I hope some broken fingers
He plays for bama, of course not
Georgia gets sideline warnings while Bama player fights his own sideline. 
Nice fucking catch!
Alright, just got back after a shower. Left after Fromm's pick. What happened?
lol yup
That boy aint right 
Brown bout to get crucified before the start of the 4th quarter
Honestly I like this tua kid but I don't think Bama has the defense to stick this one out
Alabama doesn''t know how to play from behind. They are imploding. 
Someone is getting sacrificed to Satan tonight smdh
I bet that coach, trainer, or whoever it was probably said something they shouldn't have.
I'm actually shocked how this has turned into a QB battle. I thought for sure this team would keep it on the ground 
nice ball and catch
We just gonna ignore the holding from this GA OLine?
think so
I really wish I could have seen OU and Mayfield go against Bama's defense..
Brown has the temperament and discipline to be a high round pick for the Browns. 
Georgia's bread and butter all night has been Fromm's passing game, stick with it
We gonna need a new thread before the 4th?
Either way, they've got a title winner
We need a streamable for this
https://i.imgur.com/WsVdlFh.gifv
Its mostly bama. They are trash.
That guy shouldn''t see another second of playtime. What a fucking asshole
Jfc....as shits going down, can hear the frantic whistles, crowd getting animated, etc.....ESPN cuts away to the boothCmon
Riley ruining Calvin's draft stock
Targeting on Bama? He hit Chubb in the head while he was on the ground.
Dear Georgia and Georgia Fans,Please, for the love of god, hold on here. Preferably, beat the ever-living shit out of Bama for us. Them Dawgs is Hell.Love,Everyone else in the CFB World
yes
SAD!
I have no idea how we got this far with him. That really tells you two things: QB isn't everything. And this team is extremely well rounded to make up for his shortcomings.
Anybody have video replay?
its bad
I think Saban just benched him and it looks like they''re team is playing better than the first half. Idk I didn''t hear why.
*I am sure if I hit my coach, I''ll establish dominance*
Man wtf is going on with 48. Does Saban tolerate that kind of behavior? 
Sony is hurting us. I hope they keep Chubb in
What does he have a weak collarbone or something?
Dunno. Not Saban.
I think he was trying to hit the guy who pulled him away from the Georgia player he punched
Someone was in the way of the ref running down the sidelines
Fromm is fuckin' legit.
r/watchpeopledie
? Few commentators would ever acknowledge that.
Are you trying to say this game isn't exciting??? 
What?  
Understandable, this game is so exciting I am having trouble making coherent sentences.Good luck!
Giving up 3rd and longs all night long.  Fucking awful.
Looked like an assistant coach. 
*cries War Eagley*
If Georgia wins I'll literally eat my bulldog.
Where's this legendary Alabama defense?
That ref hard cheesing after michel bounced the ball to him
Not Saban, an assistant 
I understand this reference. 
Was he swinging at a coach on the sideline?
amazing pass protection by UGA's OL
I l8ve watching Ridley catch. *2015 natty on another screen as i cri*
Alabama: Civil War
It just pisses me off so much that we miss that thrown punch and potential scrum because ESPN feels the need for us to look at their "Personalities" against a bland background. Fuck off with the self-importance and show me the damn game.
Plot twist: at the end of the game both quarterbacks remove their masks to reveal that they are actually sophomores
Sabans going to beat 48s butt when they get back. No excuse for throwing a fit 
What was the story with the fighting on Bamas sideline?
Fromm is on point.
>BrotherDRINK
84 just has to poop really bad so he is trying to do anything to get back to the locker room
Someone told 48 to stop being a bonehead, and he kept being a bonehead...
I see u
Offense was getting nowhere. New guy seems to be doing okay so far. Got some points. 
That Alabama Sideline could make a good reality show...
man i'd love to be a uga fan right now
They've got tutorials for everything these days
Easy there, ESPN 
UCF national champs!
True freshman for GA.
He shoulda been ejected dude. Straight up punched a guy
What a bitch
Georgia will be fucking terrifying next year. 
Riley is the top 10 pick obviously.
Looking at your flair, we've got a common enemy here, my friend.
Roll tude 
Typical Bama LOL
What's the age of consent in Georgia because there is a lot of freshman fellating going on
Did 48 try to attack Saban or another coach 
Tried his damnest to pop him
Nice
Did 48 just fight his coach?
Or maybe UCF is just that good
48 about to get banished to the neutral zone.
I haven't kept up...are they still saying Fromm can't throw? 
Or Auburn. Clemson would, though.
Somebody give #48 the "tough guy" award, STAT.  Maybe that'll settle him down!
Jesus 48, that's the kind of attitude that has you heading back home after college, watching your teammates at the combine on TV.
Refs come on 
That was unnecessary roughness
Yo. Just let Fromm throw 
I mean you have to be stupid to swing on a player because helmets but to swing on your coach is a whole 'nother level of stupid. 
How is that not a penalty? 
Video of #48 meltdown?
Should be a penalty on Wilson there too 
WHERES THE PENALTY ?????
That Bama player just shoved a random woman on the sideline out of his way while throwing a fit...
WTF playcall was that :?
ugh part of me doesnt want to bring in top 5 classes because theres a much higher probability of them acting like #48 from bama. completely embarrassing 
Brown fell for his trap
along with punching a dawg, tried attacking coaching staff or player on his own team
NICK SABAN HAS LOST CONTROL
Bama is fighting their own team now lol
No flag on that extra head push?
Damn sign those guys up for secret service. They were on #48 with in milliseconds 
good thing it is their last game of the season.
Ok shove the QBs head lol
What is the the XFL.
That was unsportsmanlike
Where is the flag on the helmet push
Fromm is a straight-up baller
Damn I hate our fucking offense 
The backup players raising hell is an extremely-strong indicator that Alabama didn't have a good attitude going into this. 
I think he just wasn''t playing well?  After the change Bama looks completely reenergized
Bama is tryna get flagged right now
Wtf?
lol the whole UGA sideline is standing way back haha
No flag on that?
You have to throw a flag on #30 too...
Nah it''s Bama. 
That little head shove wasn't a foul? the fuck?
WTF REFS
gif of the guy going after Saban anyone?
How the Fuck was that not a penalty?
Uhhh penalty on #30????
How did they not throw a flag right there...
shit the  time he does keep it, they fucking read it to a tee
What the fuck? He just shoved his head?
Precisely what I said lol
They grow em real classy like down in dat dere bama
That's pretty fucking accurate. 
Will you bring me a large order of fries? I''ll Venmo you
He said they'll self police over there. Lol
No flag for the extra shove to the head?!?!
fuck these players gettin mad
Wtf calll that shit
**The bulldogs are playing pretty good so far, Gary Danielson is nervous right now**
Inb4 3rd down coversion
It'd be nice if the secondary would show up. Fromm gets all the credit for the good throws but damn. 
don't understand how he's still allowed to stay in the stadium
Yeah, they finally showed a replay.  Can't believe 48 didn't get ejected for the punch (or for trying to fight his coaches).
Did he just shove his head?
JESUS BAMA IS SO FUCKING DIRTY
Nice late push by Bama 
flag
Almost another 15
Wilson wtf man
I'm on sling and its great.
Yep
THIS IS SUCH BULLSHIT FUCK BAMA
Is Ridley going to enter the NFL draft? Asking for a franchise.
Nice extra shove there.
That should have been a penalty.
Frohm is a G
yes
Yes
Apparently you've never seen my face when I don't shave for a week.
Especially not on a Saban-Bama team O_O
lol, wut?
You can''t push a QB''s head down like that come on.
**[PEOPLE OF EARTH TO GEORGIA TONIGHT.](https://i.imgur.com/cHUsero.gif)**
Wait that guys not even a starter? And he thinks he can do that without getting dropped? What a fucking moron. 
WHY MACK... chill bruh
Should've been another penalty on Wilson for that head shove there on Fromm. WTF Refs
Bama's getting frustrated
Everyone has a plan until they're punched in the face 
Punched a Bulldog. Nothing serious, looked like the shoulder pad or helmet, got chewed out by Saban briefly, then lost his cool on the sidelines and shoved some assistants and had to be held back
Can''t believe they let him get away with that. 
Why is he able to just shove Fromm's head after he's down?
That''s 15 more, why he shoving his helmet 
Damn Bama, you be poor losers
Come on, that bit at the end wasn''t needed. Flag that 
That's unsportsmanlike and that ref didn't give a fuck
Brown's muttonchops helps me imagine his angry rant sounding like the Cajun Bayou Waterboy coach
3rd down, here comes a 20 yard gain
He's perfect for East Mississippi CC
His carrer
wtf was that by 30?
peppered his steak an extra twist
Mods!!
I missed it 
No flag? Are you serious? WTF
WHAT'S THE FLAG ON THAT REF?
Lol 30 should have drawn a flag.
What the fuck was that shit at the end?
that was dirty dude
Fromm can fuck my girl if he wants if he finishes this game with a W
30 should have been flagged
I probably shouldn't just be realizing this now but do *both* of these teams have a wide receiver named Ridley?
Get rolled, Tide
Who's band is playing when Bama has the ball on offense, is that a Georgia defense song?
He''s off the team I guarantee it.
That seems flag worthy to me
bruh hows that not a flag
ok that push to the ground on a QB would be a 15 yarder in NFL. 
That should have been a flag. I am wholly disappointed with this team. Unacceptable shit.
 Cannot get over how dirty Alabama is 
That should be an extra 15, no?
Should have been a penalty on 30 there. Alabama losing their cool quickly.
That shove to the head after the play was unnecessary.
Now it's Georgia getting thrown around after the play. Plot twist.
With all of the things players have done and still gotten to play I have a very hard time believing that will be true
Grew up in Chiraq
Should have just brought the T-shirt, can''t deny a T-shirt.
Georgia vs Oklahoma as the natty would have been amazing.
Alabama player tried to fight his coaches on the sideline. 
lol is every AL defender gonna be a punk.  dont push him after the play
Not calling that ref?
Bama lucky they didn't draw another flag with that shove after the play.
Jfc Alabama woke up in murder-mode
Goddamn I love Fromm 
Dirty ass player 
How's that not a flag on 30 for shoving Fromms head?
That bama roid  raging
Bama is really letting their frustration show and it's gonna bite them if they aren't careful
Bama boys are salty
STOP BEING FUCKING IDIOTS
Ok where''s the penalty?!
How in the fuck is that not a penalty? These refs are complete garbage 
That should have been a personal foul on Wilson. Dirty ass shit. Fuck Alabama 
How is the ref going to look right at that and not call it?
No flag for shoving him in the head when he was already down?
Lol 1 with the juggle
We are playing like some punks 
Unsportsmanlike for pushing the QB after the tackle?
No flag for shoving the QB's head like that?  Ok...
Dude HAS to be smarter than that. If you have to keep your composure for one game this is the one.
Bama?
Wisconsin? you know they lost the Big 10 right?
Where's the unsportsmanlike there? Fuck Bama, bullshit 
Yo, where is the 15 yards for pushing Fromm's head into the turf? 
WTF WAS THAT
God Alabama is full of little bitches.  Throwing him down after the play 
They can shove Fromm like that after the play????wtf 
No holding calls all game. Good consistency, they're letting them play
Unsportsmanlike conduct?
HOW IS THAT NOT A PENALTY?
Bana looking salty at right now
Woof lucky for not another unsportsmanlike 
Mack Wilson needs to sit the fuck down. Now. 
Bama is literally playing so stupid
Yes, he was.
George pls
Bend don't break from Georgia, then some Fromm and Chubb
Throw a flag on that shove! 
Are there no Virgins left at UofA for Saban to sacrifice. 
Forget throwing him out of the game... If you try to hurt your own coach, you should be thrown out of school. 
Unsportsmanlike??
WTF is Wilson doing? WTF is Bama D doing? Dumbass should've been flagged there too.
REF WAS STANDING RIGHT THERE
These bama players are playing like bitches
How is that not a penalty, right in front of ref
how is there no flag for him slamming his head down?
Okay should THAT not be a flag? Shoves his head down after the tackle?
Watch that shit, Wilson. 
He didn't need to shove his head after the play.Surprised that wasn't flagged
WTF 
M E T A 
Saban will still let him play somehow
LOL
Wtf was that shoving Fromm's head down? How was that not a flag?
seems like Bama does not like Georgia.
48's name is not well known enough to be fighting the coach
Wow FUCK ALABAMA. 
Nice shove to the head. Alabama playing dirty and frustrated
ESPN3 should be a sideline-fight cam
30 threw a little extra ‘tude when getting up
Smack to back of helmet no call?
Not a foul to push the player on the ground after a tackle? What? 
Nothing for that shove on Fromm's head?
Are the QBs freshmen?
Yep
Is shoving his head like that not a penalty?
No unnecessary roughness?
That kid looks like he's 10ft tall catching those balls
Where''s the flag?
I feel like Bama is finally getting big headed. They usually play a sportsman like game because Saban is a very respectable coach, but this game shows a totally different personality for the team...
Wow
They are letting Alabama get away with everything jesus
Bama acting real thuggish now, shoulda been a foul with that head shove
Should have been another flag with that head shove
Where's the flag???
That extra head slap should be a personal foul as well!
I know it's not a penalty and just kind of a normal thing that happens in football but 30 pushing 11's head down was such a punkass move lol
Fromm you could have thrown that ball.  Away even.
Georgia gets nothing on run plays but every third down gets a huge gain lol 
Woulda loved the Wiscy & UCF games my dude
Wow fuck Alabama. 
Umm ok
How you got him shoving the back of the helmet there? 
WHERES THE FOUL
Knock it off, Mack.
Got away with pushing his head right there
Hes probably off the team already 
Hometown “radio” I''m guessing? They do it for both teams.
I didn''t realize I was watching ESPN 2 and was like what the hell am I watching and why isn''t ESPN cutting away from this?
And he pushed his head after he was down . WTF 
The refs really could've-- and should've-- called that
Personal foul on #30
Bama losing their composure big time
Bame #30 is a dickhead. 
No flag for shoving him in the back of the head like that?
Another dirty shot. Not cool. 
How did 30 get away with that at the end?
Easily should be
I mean you just cant make that mistake in the natty
Should have been a flag
#Discipline 
Flag that head shove
That deserved a flag. 
Lol Bama is full of punks.
Oh come on. Ref just watched him shove the QB's head down after he was down.
That defender just shoved Fromm's head after the play was dead wtf
someone is salty 
That should be 15 yards for the punch to the head.
Dirty as fuck team 
Head push after play on QB in front of ref.... nothing 
Where is the late hit on Fromm
yes
He done. Saban don''t deal with that garbage. 
...it is though.
Hopefully, but it''ll be after he finishes running the stadium
From's pocket awareness is incredibly impressive for a true freshman
how the fuck do you not see that
Yeah, don''t call the shove either. 
Pushing someone down after the play isn't the best look after your player literally just punched someone
Wowwww no flag on 30???
Push shoulda been called
Looked like it
Please mean Saban, please mean Saban...
When keeping it real goes wrong
I agree on 3 of those 4
Not a penalty what are these refs
Did #48 just throw a punch at a coach?
these alabama players need to start being ejected 
Holy shit that player took a swing at a coach....
HOW WAS THAT NOT CALLED
Such is Bama life.
Probably
HOW THE FUCK IS NONE OF THIS SHIT GETTING CALLED
Refereeing here is trash. That's an unsportsmanlike. Bama getting all the calls here
Fromm needs to be careful. Bama players don''t give a shit anymore it seems. Fucking bullshit. 
Bama players being dirty as fuck wtf refs?
Should''ve been another penalty shoving his helmet in the ground
Breaking news: Calvin Ridley has a brother who plays football too. 
Dirty shove there
These big ten refs are clueless 
Bama players all sorts of salty
Should have been a flag on that push. Alabama is getting  chippy. 
Tide getting chippy
should have been another penalty 
Wtf are these refs doing dude
Seriously!!! WTF!
Please don''t.
No flag after an attempted face smash?
Blind ass refs, cmon
Dirty Dirty Dirty
30 keeping it classy with the shove while Fromm was down. Fuck off, Bama. At least try and keep it classy. 
Should have flagged him for pushing his helmet. Teach them a lesson.
Push in the head and no flag smh
Welcome to Kirby's Dream Land
Gotcha. That's pretty much what I figured.I'll give him a look
These refs REALLY keep missing this shit
why is Bama playing so dirty.what a bunch of bitches
Not sure how that wasn't called.... that's a bush league play there 
Since when can you push a guys head when he's getting up?  The fuck
How is that not unsportsmanlike?
No flag? They need to take control of this game. 
Bama players getting super dirty out there
Shoving his head like that wasn't a penalty? How much did bama pay these refs lmao
Bama seems undisciplined. I'm surprised there was no flag for the push in the back of the head. 
you can just shove people's heads after they're down now? 
Did Brown try to go after Saban? I only saw him getting held back
That shoulda been another 15....
official retardation
He''s heated talking about how Seattle throwing at the goal line was the right play. 
I don''t think they have mentioned it...
No you heathen
lol
Late hit?!
how the fuck is that not a foul? 
Bama playing dirty
Come on you can't let him shove his helmet like that
Yeah that shove to the head is another unsportsmanlike penalty.
Wow no flag. Bama how can you root for a team that doesnt get flags thrown 80% of the time
Unsportsmanlike 
what a catch
noooo. not the pupper
then Georgia threw a pass, defleected and intercepted and returned 20 yeards
Wtf after the play?!?? 
These refs are fucked 
Bama be bitches
bama's a buncha bitches jesus christ
SIDELINE WARNING THOUGH
dude, Wilson just straight up smacked Fromm in the back of the head IN FRONT OF A REF and no flag
Wth was 48 On Tide thinking?? First a Georgia player now ya own guys on the Sideline?? He's gotta be out for sure, especially if Saban say that
Bama playing dirty. No need for that shove. 
So uh.. legally speaking would the University of Alabama get in trouble if they leave a player in Atlanta?
Watching these guys run against Oklahoma vs running against Bama is insane
Bama
Seriously. Classless
Is he still alive? 
You got exposed by Ohio State tho...
Exposed? You don't think it has anything to do with two of the best teams playing eachother?
Bama is so fucking dirty
Isnt that a penalty??
Bama some dirty mother fuckers when they're losing.
Unsportsmanlike? 
Thought it was oddly placed eye black at first 
Knew exactly what he was doing, he was baiting him not actually beefing with him. Composure
Let's see...
I'm straight chillin' over here
So you get to just push the QBs head into the ground now? Ok cool
Sheeeesh Bama is dirty right now 
Dirty fuckers
Bama is losing it
That was a slap there...How was that not called???
Bama getting chippy.
Dirty bama dirty refs
84 obviously said some super classless shit.  You can tell from the stupidly smug reaction.
Wiscy shouldn't have lost. 
Are we watching the same Game? Literally every commentator agreed that he didn't cross the neutral zone and was baited by two bama lineman jumping
Oh bama you is dirty
Bama players are not used being behind and absolutely are acting like assholes 
Jesus Christ Bama, calm your players down. 
Get Wilson out of thw game
some fuck boy shit
Fuck these dirty ass players!!
Awful blocking otherwise that might have been a first down
TE totally failed on that block.
Brothers
No but I did eat ribs last night
Man Bama should have got another penalty there 
That should''ve been a penalty 
Borderline unsportsmanlike penalty there too. Bama not looking like a saban team right now
Jesus Bama's playing dirty
Ridley's Believe It or Not
IMAGINE THAT SHOVE FROMMS HEAD INTO THE GROUND AND NO FLAG FUCK YOU REFS
Bama literally getting away with EVERYTHING
That's why Fromm doesn't pull it
STUDENT athlete
No bamboozle 
They're brothers.
Another fuck up by these refs. 
That should be a flag. Come on now refs quit being biased.
ALABAMA HAS NO FUCKING CLASS.
Flag that shit. Fuck these refs!!!!
These refs are pathetic 
Alabama should have been flagged on that wtf
Yo wtf this is some dirty shit
This game might be run by vegas
Was the second place trophy a horcrux?!
Busy game planning with BB

BAMA LOSING DISCIPLINE
Holy shit that should have been a flag
ANOTHER MISSED PENALTY ON BAMA 
Bama players classless as shit as always, assholes...

WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING. THIS IS GONNA FUCK US UP
Kinda sad if you think about it. Dude fucked up, he''ll be feeling sick to his stomach for weeks after this.
Flag worthy push...
[removed]
Bama needs to calm the fuck down. Shoulda been a personal foul. They're playing like punks right now. 
How the fuck was that not a call 
bama is playing mad salty right now
LOL
30 should have had a 15 there.
Bama Fans. This is what happens when you get handed a championship game after getting participation trophy's all year. 
Our d needs to cool it gonna cost a lot more penalties. 
What are these refs doing?!
'Nother missed Alabama call.
Who the fuck is George?
Ask if they're related next.
Yes. Brothers even. 
Bama players losing their cool.
lol just hit the QB in the head it's legal now 
48 you can transfer to mizzou after a year fam. 
Let's keep being stupid
Someone has to explain to me why the refs have swallowed their whistles
That should've been called.
Great time for the refs or coaches or anyone to quell the 'Bama frustration before someone gets hurt.
How's that not an unsportsmanlike?
God damn, Bama looking like the Seahawks out here
Fuck that shove.
Why not keep going to Michel
HOW IS THAT NOT A FUCK
Ref$
Please
The ref is standing right over him as he pushes after the tackle... This is just a sad display of refereeing 
Bama is allowed to play so dirty.
Bama is dirty as fuck
How the hell is that not unsportsmanlike conduct?
Nice job keeping the game clean refs
Fuck Bama. Fuck the refs
Man it''s hard to believe that both of those WR''s are related to the girl from Star Wars. 
Wow, Alabama looking like a bunch of sore losers
back up mlb
Clemson got beat by Bama though??
nice shove 
Refs more worried about the sidelines than real penalties. 
Was 48 trying to go after Saban?
Uh refs, head shove? The fuck?
Manchild tried to go after his own coach lol
Where's the fucking flag???? He slammed his head.
Bama fucking getting away with everything.
Bama are such fucking punks.
How the hell can Bama fans feel good rooting for this trashy and classless team Jesus 
going after your own coach like that. Boy if that was my team, your ass wouldnt see another down in your career playing for me.
Bama players are unsportsmanlike asshats
They're brothers
They do!
Bama''s players are starting to get *real* chippy. Kids can''t play from behind. Bunch of sore losers.
Extra shove to the head next to the Georgia sideline? Bama is right on the edge. 
Fromm has made some mistakes but that dude has showed up tonight. 
OU was the #2 team this year
Little bama is getting frustrated
Do they do that a lot or just during national championship games? 
>Wisconsinwut
Alabama how the fuck do you go to the CFP every year and still not know how to act like you've been here before. JFC.
Bama is falling apart wtf
My brother swirched it to the coach film room and I can't be more thankful that I,finally found someone else that loves the coaches film room <3
That shove was so obvious what in the fuck
These refs love Bama.
Saban, you have some coaching to do. 
Fuck that we need the vid!
Georgia is everything Bama wishes it could be as a State
Bama is getting frustrated
I love how angry this game is. Saban needs to calm his players down though
C H I P P YHIPPY

They're brothers. UGA little bro, Bama big bro. 
Man these refs won''t call shit on Bama 
Alabama is dirty af 
Alabama is mentally weak.
Alabama is the New England of College Football.
How did that player last all this time on a Saban team? He seemed way to erratic and hot headed.
Sheesh. Bama seems like a pretty classy team. 
If you're not being sarcastic, they're brothers.
They have like 110 yards on 30+ carries... that''s a little over 3 yards a pop. Not exactly unstoppable... 
I swear are the refs blind tonight?
Fuck you Bama
That''s a PF...
D too angry right now. We gotta tighten up. 
Niiiiiice
Fucking bama
2nd
I like trucks.
Hi-Def Roku on ESPN App...no problems.

Alabama is filled with punk asses. 
No hold there? Lol

Alabama apologist announcer
That seems really gratuitous
Nauta is our only TE who can block. Damn.

Yep.  They are brothers.  The older Ridley is a senior on Bama.  The younger is a freshman for GA.
WTF REFS
Alabama looking like 80s Miami
How was that not a flag? 
Wow Georgia got punked. Refs want it close 
48 Transferring to  Baylor
The refs literally want Bama to win. You can't say otherwise.
Fuck Alabama, cut it out with that shit
Bama playing dirty af
Dirty
These refs are pure clowns
Dude was egging him on. He wanted that reaction 
They don't like that Georgia is giving them the business to this point.Georgia has been imposing its will.
Nothing to see here -Refs
They should review that crap for targeting. Forceful contact to the head or neck area.
cheap shot and no flag
Calvin and Riley, yeah
They're brothers, yes.
This officiating is absolutely hot trash.
How the fuck is Bama getting away with this shit?I mean I know why, but it's a rhetotical question.
Can you punch your own teammate in a play and get a flag for that?
Bama is playing like a bunch of fucking  assholes out there. Jesus.
They''ll give sideline warnings but not call the shove to the head on the ground. Okay refs 
Usually not one to call out the refs, but seems like they have an Alabama bias right now.
I feel like Bama is losing it a bit. Not used to their own medicine. Spoiled by their own success a bit?
Fuck these refs. How do you not call that??
l-0-l-0-l
Fucking dirty piece of shit 
Calls? We dont need no stinkin calls. JK we gonna get no called outta this game. 
That was some horrible unsportsmanlike shit that wasn't called there
dawgs come onnn
Nah, he didn't punch a ref's hands away while the ref tried to help him up. No ejection.
Thanks Lincoln Riley
How can she slap
Bama a punch of punky bitches.
Does unnecessary roughness just not exist for Bama?
That head shove was pretty malicious. 
Watching Bama lose their shit is funny
Mack got away with one there.
Bama players are dirty 
That's pi ref wake up. God damn
K. 
Game is rigged 
Seems consistent with Big Ten refs. 
I'm rooting for Shane Beamer.
Wow. Embarrassed the way a couple of our guys are acting.
Bama is getting away with some serious thuggery
What was that dirty ass bullshit
Hey Alabama, can you chill?
Right in front of the ref 
What a play by Wallace
defense needs to calm the fuck down
Perfect throw by Fromm and nice hands but great defense.
God damn it B1G refs, you're gutting the B1G's perfect bowl season. 
LB
Yes Calvin (Bama) is the older brother of Riley (UGA)
This is fucking unreal... why are they acting like some morons out there
Unsportsmanlike conduct!?
I've never seen Alabama players act so stupid
Mack Wilson is an asshole.
Pass interference
Wilson should've gotten 15 there, too.  Bama is frustrated and it's showing.
DPI 
I have no concept of how that didn't get flagged.
Bama''s getting away with a lot of personal fouls
That shove to the head of Fromm could have easily been another penalty. 
Bama getting dirty... 
Just not going to call that stuff on Alabama huh?
PI
These refs suck ass. Blatantly Bama favored 
it would be a real shame if bama were to be blown out.a reaaalllll shame.
Bama benefiting from refs. As always. "Discipline"
bama acting a bit thugish. seems like they can't handle being whipped
Not flagging personal fouls after the play is dead.#IT JUST MEANS MORE
Y'all are surprised at bama players being dirty and not getting called on it?
Nick sabans running low on souls, he needs a fresh sacrifice 
They''re brothers
That push after the tackle could have been a penalty too.
The fuck was that
No call on the extra shove by 30?
Has Nick Saban lost control of the Alabama football program??????
ALL over him
No doubt
Fuck the refs
Alabama doesn't take losing very well bunch of butt hurt little cry babies 
Wtf Bama that was rude
Alabama players are dirty as fuck.
So he''s allowed to smash fromms head after a play huh?Smh
Lol if you think it doesn't deserve to see the field again, youre soft asf 
I don't think anyone has said it yet, so I'll be the first to say what everyone's thinking: *Did he swing at a coach on the sideline???*
Holy shit Alabama plays dirty! Why did a flag not get thrown there.
No flag on that head shove?  TF?
throwin' hands
True
yeahhhhh. no.
If Alabama wants to stay in this game, they've GOT to stop letting UGA get under their skin. All the shoving and near-fights are getting irritating at this point. 
Come on refs. Fucking hell
Control your fuckin players Saban
these 3rd down conversions are ridiculous. nullify amazing defense on 1 and 2nd downs...8/14 on 3rd down.
Should have had another unsportsmanlike conduct.
That could hurt a guys neck doing that shit. Might not look like much, but damn.
Bama is getting every call this half
BRING OUT UCF
16 national championships bud 
it looked like he was yelling at an assitant who said something to him first.
Weird that not one has gone in to do anything in the NFL 
I HATE ALABAMA SO MUCH OMGGGGGGGGG
Ok maybe *that* should've been called
Not biased towards Bama though, right Bama fans?
48 = bad
lol kirk just saved himself pretty damn well
DPI
Holding?
That's what I saw but it's got to be wrong. He did go after a coach didn't he?
Tell me your thoughts on true freshman
Damn dude, Alabama are playing like some bitches now
PERSONAL FOUL YOU FUCKING REFS
Refs really don't want to kill Bama
Okay, I take back my respect. Bama, y''all are a bunch of dirty fucks. 
Our players need to chill the fuck out Jesus 
Not too many things make you play harder than going up against a sibling.
4K TV + ESPN stream = 480p resolution
Why would you do that Wilson? Damn I'm feeling bad right now 
They low down....
This game is a damned joke
He plays the fucking idiot
How is that not a flag?
That *shouldve* been taunting
***gotta keep 'em in it eh boys?!?!?!?***
And now your attacking the quarterback ! WTF defense?!?
It's a 10 point game not a blowout yet guy
I''ve always thought of Bama players as professional, but this game is flipping my opinion hard.
Watching this game, it's just crazy how much faster these players are than ours pretty much across the board.
yep
Someone needs to take their belt off and spank these kids. Acting like idiots.
Lol refs trying to keep this a game so hard. I've gone from completely indifferent to fuck Bama in 2 quarters
This shit is getting chippy, I'm hoping for a brawl, sorry not sorry. 
No ejection for throwing a punch and now a shove to the head after the play. Wtf refs?
I'm really full on hate erection rooting against Alabama now. Assholes on display.  Edit: Lol wtf? How did 36 people even see this? 
No flag for pushing the QB's head against the ground well after the play was oveR?
Another score or two and some Bama player is going to straight murder someone on the field.
A no call on Bama? Shocking.....
Bama composure unraveling.  Come on, act like you've been there before.
What''s DPI anyway?
This game isn''t the only thing he''s gonna finish ;)
Damn Bama playing like a bunch of dirty fucks.
Missed PI
Bama is complete trash jc
It's a violent game yet little shoves can decide them. smh
This is amazing
I'm confused
Holy hell, that was just blatant. The ref was right there! The crowd roared after the fact--I'm guessing that shove was on the replay? 
It was another coach... that would've been something 
Whats up with the shots to the head? that would get called in the nfl
Should have been one, if anything to get these guys to calm the fuck down 
That head shove was a bitch move by that Bama defender. How stupid do you have to be to do that down 10 at midfield late in the 3rd quarter?
Bama is making it so much easier than it already was to hate them.
Wilson lucky no flag there
Refs encouraging dirty behavior 
Fuck Alabama so hard, no class. And fuck the refs too. 
Ramseys in
Calm. The. Fuck. Down. Bama.
Pretty sure he just wants to stab him to death, sacrifice or not.
That''s not interference??
Wtf is wrong w our guys?
Refs are fucking useless.
Man fuck Bama
Did that ball actually go anywhere?
These Bama corners been big dickin it all night.
yes
...That was a weird play
So many missed calls benefiting Bama it is ridiculous
I mean when refs dont call you for shit, why play clean 
Yeah because you can totally just shove people''s heads after the play
Alabama players are so unbelievably trashy. Reflection of the state I suppose 
How do they not call that
Mediocre punting
I prefer Metal bitches
Yes sir . 
Fuck these refs
wow. how is that not a flag? This shit is so fucking tilted in bama's favor. 
I mean, they did blow out the top seed.
I love how Alabama gets those cheap shots after tackles.
That''s three huge momentum stopping no calls. The face mask, the “offsides” and what should''ve been an unsportsmanlike for shoving Fromm
Ayyy Alabama. Stop being little bitches and play football. 
I was lead to believe that these refs are rewarded by being allowed to officiate these huge bowl games by being good during the year.Dafuq was that shit
How's that not a flag?
Bama players getting butt hurt and being dirty. Fuck Bama
I was hoping for that fake.
GO FOR IT
Wallace was on him like a spidermonkey
hey you can hit someone in the head no flag, but keep your sidelines back 
$ B $ A $ M $ A $
A lot of contact for a no call...
Lmao obvious pass interference 
lol Wallace was hanging onto his arm...
He shoved his head that''s a fucking flag I don''t get it
$aban getting all the calls today
um ok, lol
SAD!
Yeah that's gotta be one of the stupidest things I've ever seen. 
Some refs need to be fired immediately.
Just here for regular Watch ESPN Sucks!!
Jeekers
Should've been a first down from that shove
Ref saw that dirty shit and didn't call it
Our guys meed to chill the FUCK OUT. Seriously, this is disgraceful
Pass interference too.
They could literally murder a guy and Refs won''t cal it
That was close to disaster.
Guess we can throw punches 
I'm still outraged there was no flag on the head push
Well, I guess I would prefer the CFP trophy live in Athens than in Clemson. 
God fuck bama
That was silly
Noice! Heads up kick there Ramsey!
Bama guys showing the team's full of punks.
Alright, so I didn't miss much. Thanks. 
holy shit thugbama
Oh, you can just punch people now?
Bama has no class tonight
WTF Kirby
Wow, waaay to risky there. 
Lol that was cute 
Thank you. I know the dirty play isn't on the fans, but it's frustrating to see.
He... punched a dude? That's literally battery. 
These refs are horrible
Is Alabama always this cheap?
Good ol'' Big Ten refs. 
Is that #48 sent to the locker roo
Nope. He may not be, but I wouldn't be surprised if he's off the team. 
aaan no flag for shoving his head after he was down wtf?
Buddy Stephens already sliding into #48's DMs.
THE BALLS ON THAT PUNTER
HE FAKED THE FAKE
Damn, he fooled me thinking he was going to throw it
*Pama a punch of punky pitches
They all got with their cousins 
It really is
Are we... are we the bad guys?
Youd think Saban would have more control over his team 
WHEW, that was scary
That was sketchy as hell. 
That no call there was bullshit
Refs can''t call obvious unnecessary roughness but can call sideline warnings
Bama players to fuckin cool it.  Geez.  Bama players are a bunch of spoiled brats that can't handle losing.
Lucky he didn't get blocked.  Yikes.
This game is gonna be a show, because of how the Bama players are already acting 
Risky
Good defense there
I hope they yank his scholarship.
Yeah, and you don't want to end it on a loss, so my point stands...
Saban running a dirty group of players apparently
Fuck you 30, that's horseshit
these fucking refs dude... 
Alabama getting frustrated, its all downhill from here.
Refs are obviously tring to give this to the SEC
Asshole*
Why?
Alabama is just disappointing to watch this game. The player behavior and ref assist is annoying 
Bama players really not representing themselves well right now. 
did we just option fake a punt..?
What the fuck was that?
Bama is acting like that rich kid with all the cool stuff and the hot girlfriend who gets moved to the side by the average Joe with the big dick
Solid fake. Not mad at them for it!
Holy shit idk everyone complains about this but ESPN streaming is a fuckin abomination! 
Dafuq was that Georgia? 
That was ballsy as fuck
Lol just how he drew it up
He did
Yes.
Kendrick Lamar Concert?
How the hell was pushing his helmet after he was down not a flag?
Bama has been embarrassing tonight on third down
Cute, 30.
Bama is fuckin undisciplined af 
Nice flair, bro.
Attempted assault, thank you very much. 
"as always" you hate bama and are jumping on one of the times we are acting like douches, its okay to say it.
How in the world was that not a penalty? Bama getting away with straight thuggery now
F I X E D 
Georgia might be the first team in history to be playing against two teams at once in the national championship
Well that was a spooky moment.
Have u seen the majority of Bama fans? Most of the ones that didn't graduate Bama aren't the definition of classy 
Mines great on PS Vue through my laptop 
Idk if ive ever seen a fake punt option
That punt scored the HECK out of of me
wth was that
Dual threat QB. 
Flair up before you talk shit
These refs are so so bad
Tide showing their true colors and refs letting it happen
Saban is close to Marvin Lewis levels of losing control of his players at this point.
LOL. What a play
Saw that, that was the last play I saw. 
Fuck these BAMA players, saban needs to get his bitches under control.
#FUCK BAMA
Dude shoved the guys head into the ground after the play right in front of the fucking ref and nothing. Fuck that shit. 
What a weird punt play just to end up at the 20 yard line anyway.
When you panic ult in Overwatch
should have been a personal, wtf refs
These refs dont want to call anything on Bama
Some of our players are making us look bad. No need for the extra shit. Win gracefully and lose gracefully, as I sit in my recliner with no heightened levels of adrenaline. 
Aww, I was really hoping Ramsey would chuck it
Bama players need to calm the fuck down. 
Usually when players act like this means they've already lost the game.We'll see.
Dumb risk there
No call for the push after the tackle?!? This is why everyone hates Alabama.
anybody got a gif of the swing...
Should have been PI
Fix isIs in for bama
I mean that was their seeding
Iron Bowl this year was glorious. I''ve never seen a Nick Saban team this undisciplined til before year.
These refs are a fucking joke
Brice Ramsey? Whaaaaaaat?
these refs are tilting me
I''m sure he''ll mesh well with Buddy Stephens 
I started this game not caring about who wins, but these little temper tantrums and undisciplined shit from some of these bama players is shifting my view a little bit
Let's not
Guys, I have been a lifelong bama fan and I''ve never seen them act this way. You can say they always do this but I haven''t seen it. I''m disgraced by the way our players are acting.  
That was dumb...like, really dumb. 
These fucking refs need to control Bamas players. Wtf is going on
Da fuq
Fuck bama fuck the refs. Keep the fucking kids safe. Bama out here trying to break necks
Fuck bama and those asshole players.
Love the fake fake punt
> Bama fans> trashy and classlessYou''re surprised?
Because it was right in front of the ref.  Too obvious to call.
Flair up homie
Heres a [gif](https://twitter.com/Deadspin/status/950578313302601728) of the punch by 48 on the sideline
Saban needs to get his kids under control. 
NO bama bias right??
Yo this shit is rigged as fuck. Refs doing their best to keep Alabama in it 
Kirby you don't get cute on Saban and get away with it  
They could've walked the ball further than that punt.
Good ok Bama refs 
Not a recent update.
Im honestly ashamed.
I'm glad we agree. Congrats on the Natty loss 
HOW ISNT THAT UNSPORTSMANLIKE OM NUMBER 30 
WTF is this shit? Just shove Fromm Head???
Lol bama melting down
Obvious pass interference, announcers don''t even say anything
basically a parody of the NFL that was super funny and stupid, but i loved ithttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XFL (an actual sport btwl)
They''re brothers
That was too cutesy for a guy named Smart.
Classy as always 'Bama
That was... a bit too courageous 
What you doing there Bryce?
Can't sort the comments by "New" for some reason, only have "Live" as an option (awful design choice mods, that's unreadable). Can anyone explain to me what Alabama #48 did?
Un fucking called for. Shit like that head push makes me embarrassed. 
Yes he did. I can't believe they didn't take him to the locker room right then and there
Who's winning?
Cool cool, so it seems like it's a little of both. Play both because they have a cannon of a leg, but ultimately football is the better choice career wise
This is who Bama is. This game has gotten out of the refs control. This is embarrassing for the NCAA.
This is the least disciplined Bama team I've seen in a bit. Bama doesn't know how to handle being owned.
It's getting chippy folks!  I can sense the tension growing.   
Cuttcliffe is just fucking done with both these teams in the Coaches room and its kinda great. 
This is a weird game, but I love it lol
Yeah what the hell, right in front of the ref
LMAO.  No penalty on Wilson there?  Alabama getting homefield advantage in Georgia.
Georgia may be winning. But these no-calls and calls by the refs is suspect as fuck.
Watching Alabama this quarter is like watching a two year old whine because it''s not getting its way.
Punch should have been ejected and that head shove should have been 15 yards. Wtf.
Refs showing their crimson loud and proud 
Is it a penalty to throw hands at your own coach?
If Bama keeps doing dirty shit someone on Georgia is going to retaliate and it'll ruin this game.
honest show of hands, whoever thought they'd see Brice Ramsey on the field in the National Championship 
Agreed, I am not liking the behavior at all
That''s what I was thinking. 
SO obvious, even in real-time.
so bama gets to whack guys upside the head after the play?
Holy shit Alabama is a team of undisciplined punks
Alabama acting like a bunch of punk ass bitches
Garbage
Hot damn Wallace, now that is a play.
Where is the Rose Bowl officiating crew? We need them
oh that was some dumb shit
That definitely wasn''t unsportsmanlike 
or any night
Smacking a dude on the head after a play is fine.BUT YOU WATCH WHERE YOU STAND ON THE FUCKING SIDELINE SO HELP MY GOD
New to this sub. How do you guys feel about Alabama?
I saw the aftermath where 48 went after a  coach, but what got him so hot? I missed it
Should have just went for it
Tonight? 
Says New Jersey?!
Refs seem very biased if not ejecting that one kid and no flag on the push to the head of Fromm
Bama is dirty as fuck. I've never seen a Saban team like this 
as if we needed another reason to hate the scum of the south
That was fun
Who would would an Alabama team trying to fight their own coaches or one Frommy boi.
Edgy of you. Go take a dab. 
Dude shoved his head after the tackle. How did he get away with that? Oh wait.. refs
Poor Bama players can't handle being outplayed
Shits getting dirty for bama
Never seen Bama lose their cool like that 
lol that thread comment was hilarious. I bet Hawaii speaks better English than Alabama and in a southern myself . 
Alabama''s not even out of this game yet. If they quit acting like they''ve never lost they may have a chance but damn.
Yeah yeah yeah, but have you seen how well the sidelines have been enforced?
This is embarrassing for non gameplay reasons. Come on guys
The red stood there and watched Wilson commit that personal foul and didn''t call it.
The Stark differences between the teams right now. Bama has fighting and arguing amongst themselves and are making inexcusable mistakes while Georgia is showing cheering for themselves and not getting to upset at teammates for making dumb mistakesEdit: that grammar is horrendous, my bad
Any other team but Bama would've had a penalty on that shove. And at least one ejection from those two plays.
This game is making me want to crawl into a hole. 
Stay classy Bama
This officiating is terrible 
What the fuck was that
but why?
I didn't even realize Ramsey was still on the team.
Lmao he was gonna throw it
And several loading stoppages.
I''m sensing some ref bias. Dude pushed the QB''s head down right in front of the ref and he did nothing about it 
Jesus Christ these refs love Bama. 
Dare I say it? Pac12 refs are better lol
How the shit is that not def PI? He was hugging before the ball was there
Right in front of the ref cmon
Same. He would be cut and his scholarship would be void.
bunch of punks on Alabama's team
Saban's gonna flip his fucking shit after this quarter and half this team will be running laps until they die of exhaustion. 
Well, they never go to class anyway
I too have this delimma
Pushing Fromm's head down right in front the ref? How was that not called?
Holy shit you would think Pete Carrol was coaching bama
Based on the other 13 replies, I'm guessing they're related
Ayyy a QB pooch kick
Try one of the teams radio streams, I've had less buffering issues
How did Bama get away with those calls?
I feel like pushing the QBs head down after the play would normally warrant a flag?
There should''ve been a flag for that shove, but these refs have been blind today. 
So does 48 still have a scolly in the spring?
You know, I know, we know...
His parents didn't even try. They just removed the L from Calvin's name
Another 15 yard penalty not called against Bama 
can someone get a streamable of the #48 altercation 
He was just getting up forcefully using Fromm's head.
so if you want to 'watch' the game don't 'watchespn' it doens't work.  
Shoving a dudes head in is fine but how dare you step off the sideline
Fuck bama
If a fight breaks out the responsibility lies with the Referees for allowing so many dirty hits to happen.
How does that not get called?
Seriously FUCK THESE TERRIBLE REFS
AlAbaMA Is A pLaYOfF CaLiBeR TeAm
I mean this literally and not snarky at all, but...they don't know how to lose
If that were true they would've reversed the 80 yard TD which was a close call
I think they're gonna throw another flag on Georgia's sidelines next time a Bama player throws a punch
I mean I was already pretty anti-Bama but this shit is making me root even harder for a blowout. 
that was one hell of a no call.
Alabama really playing out of control for a team down 10. 
Hopefully this will end y'alls little fake friendship. Bama some nasty boys.
What a way to tell your starting QB that you have no confidence in him turning the game around 
I mean we're gonna expect refs to call a head shove?Did y'all forget the Auburn suplex? 
What you doing, Georgia...
My mind is still caught up on that spar on the sidelines 
Bunch play Bama players not used to losing being beaten and losing their calm. 
Where is the PI?
No idea how that wasn't another flag.
Refs trying to save the SEC bowl record. 
That also
Bro you cannot push people after tackles wtf????
Saban is losing institutional control, time to death penalty the program, only solution 
These refs making a strong case for pac12 status
Wow Bama getting pretty trashy not surprising though!
I didn't even realize Ramsey was still on the team.
You'd think Saban of all coaches would have better disciplined players
Saban needs to start kicking dicks, these kids are getting too rowdy.
wtf Bama is disgraceful
Lol these refs are trash
Some gamesmanship there no doubt, but I couldn''t take a punch in the helmet so calmly 
Hitting QBs in the head after the play is apparently legal.
HOW IS THAT NOT PI!? HOW DID HE NOT GET EJECTED FOR THROWING A PUNCH!? WHAT THE FUCK IS HAPPENING.
Perfect throw, gotta make that catch in the championship game
That''s should be 15. Every time. Especially against the QB. 
Yes
What kind of punt was that?
Saban's team isn't disciplined at all, are they?
At this point the refs will let Bama get away with a duplex. Oh wait...
They low down they dirty....
It was dumb, man. I'm disappointed, but getting fouls isn't going to make the game any better.
Refs straight garbage
I like the maybe fake punt
This might be the most entertaining bowl game since the Vince Young Rose Bowl
Come on Georgia
Why?
that's the third best kind of erection
Because it''s Bama
So blatant. Fuck this seriously 
I''m waiting until an eye is poked out during a first down signal
How many blown calls have gone in Bama''s favor now? This game could be out of hand if the refs would take their heads out of their asses 
Scarborough is ridiculously huge
Not surprised the game is getting a bit chippy. Both teams have had players take borderline shots against the opposing team. Bama is just being sloppy about it now.
Why does the gender of someone he pushed matter?
Refs are trying to make this game more spicy. SCRIPTED. NOTHING IS REAL.
Holy shit Bama is playing dirty as shit right now.THROW FLAGS REFS
Should''ve been
[link of 48 trying to punch his coach](https://twitter.com/Sports_Burd/status/950578597932294146)
I''ve never seen a Nick Saban coached team this undisciplined before this year
I feel like football players have so much worse of attitudes than athletes in any other sport
Happened in FCS championship
I thought Saban ran a tighter ship than this. Typically don't see busch league shit like this from bama.
Worst referees in national title history. Unbelievable BAMA bias. Pathetic. I've never seen a QB get less respect than Fromm. UNBELIEVABLE 
Definitely should've gotten the boot.
I don't think you need papers to transfer to a juco. 
Gifted the ball....again
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
Thank you for implying we have clasee 99% of the other times!
You are not complete trash when you get to the National Championship Game, however in this game, yes, they are playing trashy.
Holy shit, refs are being super biased for Bama. 
Cause bama
UGA's is named Cavin (Bama's is Calvin), so he goes by his middle name.
Bama has no composure when they get down. No heart. 
lmao was Kirby seriously about to fake punt that? nearly backfired
Bama, you are your players are acting like classless punks. 
So, is everyone on the Bama hate train?
[deleted]
OU playcalling cost them a title.
two drives that should've been extended for Georgia but Bama got away with two blatant penalties hmm
Be easy on the refs, they're doing the best they can for people that are legally deaf, dumb, and blind.
Bama is low down and dirty. They need to learn how to lose (like LSU).
'Bama not known for trickery. Getting desperate 
The reffing in this game is horseshit.
Been too long. Last time was like the second half of the 2015 Sugar Bowl.
If they're not going to call anything, might as well go all out Georgia. Last Boy Scout all out
Georgia is playing not to lose... not a good idea in cfb, especially in the natty
I forgot Scarborough was on this team
Games tainted.
Punch people, shove people, facemask, horsecollar, whatever you want, refs won't see it.  But if you get excited on the sideline after a big play, that's a flag.
Of course not, the Semester hasn't started yet.
There wasn't enough evidence on that fortunately.
why is Jalen not at QB?
That was also DPI, wtf is this?
Was that supposed to be a fake?
AYYYYYY
No.
Which one?
[#48 is a tool](https://twitter.com/SInow/status/950578155038953473)
Bunch of bullshit not calling that personal foul. 
Wow, foot in the ground and straight up field. Nice
Levi Wallace you are so wonderful. 
Cause Bama
Benny Snell would disagree haha
We want Bama... to get a flag !!!
Fucking refs are shit in this game.  Big change from the rest of the playoffs so far.
The fuck was that?
Same. This shit is embarrassing. 
Assault by definition is an attempt, battery is succeeding in that attempt 
Bama getting every benefit of the the doubt. It's a shame they got the 4th seed 
I've never heard of Bama acting like children, so this surprises me as well.
SEEEEEETHING ANGRY
umad bro?
Did these refs go to Bama? This is shit
I really wanted Georgia to score there, just to see what more rowdiness 48 would get up to on the sidelines.
If Alabama comes back, Georgia should declare a national championship as well.
Bama 
That's pretty cool, I figured even the kickers would be legit
shhh no snitchin ;)
Give me Mountain West or give me death 
Brown is from Georgia
Bama, y'all calm down on acting like asses.  We did that back when we sucked and it didn't go over well then, either.
this game is insane.On the scale of hot and crazy, this game is a 10 and 10. 
**Quality Loss**
is bo scarbrough related to joe
that guy needs to transfer to Michigan
Said it for years, Saban runs an undisciplined  program
At least we''d get too many calls as opposed to no calls 
How are these big ten refs so blind to the blatant penalties by Bama
Bama fan. I'm rooting for Georgia now. Saban needs to fucking take control back from the angry morons.
And they had the offside punt block BS call.
Amen
Georgia has won if they''re in Alabama''s head like that.
That''s it Georgia get mean time to start stomping on people. 
Fyi, if ya'll didn't know, B1G refs don't call anything.
[deleted]
Georgia's DL just got shoved. Jesus Christ Bama.
People acting like this is a normal thing
They've got Bronco Mendenhall coaching
Punt pass option - PPO
Just because theirs no flag doesn't mean you guys still aren't dick's.
Refs finna keep it a close game lol
cant wait to see the gifs of that one!
5 wide BAMA? 
good tackle
wow Alabama is so unlikeable in every way.
Idk how any recruit with any dignity would want to play for a team that is this undisciplined and relies on the refs to bail them out.
Defense looking like some chumps with these shit tier actions
Thank you
As long as you''re the right team
Gotta say that Bama players aren't really showing up well discipline-wise.
Was a neutral until seeing these bama players act.
ESPN needs the game to stay close so people don't tune out.
Live sorting on mobile is a reddit Admin decision. We can''t do anything about it.
I think Bama has lost the few fans they had in this thread thanks to their douchebag players.
wtf was that punt
This game keeps getting better. Just sloppy enough to keep things super interesting, but enough great plays to make it a good game.
Tried and true classless Bama
What the fuck kind of play is that. Either go for it or don't.
NO flAg FoR pUsHing tHe QB's hEaD AgaInSt thE GrouNd wEll aFter the pLay Was ovER?
SIDELINE INTERFERENCE
You're just now sensing it? And not on the drive with 4 uncalled Bama penalties?
Oklahoma and UCF def could've beaten bama 
This feels like Duke vs Wisconsin national title game. Refs changing the game.
Big 10 refs
It is pretty entertaining
Man, the comment/title on that...
Why am i not surprised that all the calls and noncalls are benefiting Bama in the 2nd half
ugh part of me doesnt even want to bring in top 5 classes because theres a much higher probability of them acting like #48 from bama. completely embarrassing
I see now why Bama is all that. 
Double Penetration Intercourse?
Anyone know the officiating crew?
Refs are being so headass rn
I literally cannot believe how many cheap shots Bama has gotten away with in this game. To say nothing of the blatant targeting they (#14, Thompson) committed on Michel's 15 yard run on Georgia's last drive of the 1st half.
Some classless players on a bamas defense smh
Alabama acting very entitled. Don't know how to lose. A reflection of their coach as well
Eh, I am a bama hater and I have to say I haven't seen this before either. I think they just aren't used to losing and lose their cool in the moment. 
Much more likely they're just too scared to throw game changing flags in the championship game. Terrible reffing either way. 
It''s the national championship 
Children with fragile egos being told they're kings finally getting punched in the mouth.
I think ESPN used up all their commercials in the first half, they haven''t gone to break in a while. It''s nice.
Was that a fake fake punt?
Roll Tide?
If you play for Bama
Ehh, that PI/catch was too close to call imo. The head shove was BLATANT unsportsmanlike / unnecessary roughness, right in front of the referee no less. Embarrassing that the flag was missed
Hey man it's not your fault.
I'm a bama fan, but watching Bama break down is hilarious. They are acting like divas.
Bama
Dun dun dun dun da dun dun
NFL such a better product. The state of Georgia better be ready for another collapse. 
Both should have been called
Punched a UGA player causing a 15 yd penalty. Went crazy on someone on the sideline.
Hey man someone put your pokey hahas on wrong 
B1G toughness?
Ridley... CALVIN!
I keep chuckling looking at their records. Auburn is hurting watching this 
aaaand goodbye scholarship.. hello expulsion.
He who must not be Rogained.
Did you expect to live stream it in 4k?
Helps with no more flags when getting excited
Punched a Georgia player and got flagged, then on the bench went after a coach. Pushed people all the way to the bench when he got stopped 
We havent had commercials in awhile?????
Were they just waiting to use Scar until late when the defense is tired and he''s rested lol
no
Anyone get the gif of the altercation?They didn't really show it very well on the coaches film room.
Love how you can tell who is watching it live vs on WatchESPN, the comments come in waves!
that punter almost cost his team big time wow
So this is how Bama reacts when faced with adversity? I'm very unimpressed with their character. 
Saban stole our offense 
Bama has a type for rbs. Big dudes with questionable hairstyles
Except the most heinous of crimes, sideline interference. 
10:00 still the 3rd quarter. Right on 
If Bama just sticks to what got them here we might get a decent game in the 4th
He sucks
Haha, I read this to my husband and he said, "At least they aren't talking about Darnold." I guess that is one way to make it worse.
Aw man Scarborough torched us last year, was wondering where that dude was in the game plan
As someone who hates Bama, I can attest that this is pretty unusual for Alabama players. They're usually very professional. Always assumed it was because Saban would sacrifice them to the elf Lord if they acted up, but it seems the pressure is finally getting to some of these kids.
B1G
Who is worse at handling losing: Bama players or Auburn fans?
Honestly if I was a Bama fan I'd be pretty disgusted right now. I don't have anything against Bama but I never expected them to play like this. 
CHOOO CHOOO
A undisciplined Saban team, strange.
At least we're used to that
why is there so much crying jfc, it's getting a little out of hand
Nobody chatting all of the sudden
They were so quick to throw that sideline flag then just watched that happen
These are Big Ten refs. Don''t see what bias they would have.
They some snitches.
We lose a lot though. Have a lot of good guys coming up but still. Losing that leadership hurts 
It might get labeled as a stupid or salty take, but I've been saying it all night. Their defense played the game of their lives against us and didn't save any gas for this game. They wanted Clemson all year long, got Clemson, and played a highly emotional game against us. I think they're definitely suffering from an emotional letdown after that. 
Why would B1G refs love bama? That doesn't make sense. We kept OSU out of the playoffs
Man, fuck Bama.
Yeah. It was a dumb thing to do.
Whoa whoa whoa, you can't just say shit like that
He popped an UGA player in the mouth resulting in a 15 yard penalty
Punched a Georgia player then looked like he was getting into it with teammates on his sideline. 
At this point I just want to see Georgia run up to score to see bama throw a tantrum
{ } Empty set
good ole run stuff
When they win all the time and act like babies when they lose, yes
These are Big 10 refs
This game is gonna get seriously ugly if the refs don't start getting this under control 
You'd think the Big Ten refs would be itching to give Bama a Penalty every play
Bama teams are usually disciplined and play pretty clean. This looks like one of those dirty and classless BYU teams that get into petty brawls.
I have never in my life seen such a poorly refereed game.
That wasn't close to PI but that missed unnecessary roughness was pretty bad
I just wanna see some more Alabama players melt down
Refs keeping bama in the game
They almost got that shit blown up. Almost got ripped a new asshole.
You can do just about anything you want. I mean, as long as you don''t have a G on your helmet. 
yeah!
Obviously
Bama offensive line failing hard.
Alabama is literally playing like the villains in a Disney sports movie 
Folks we have met our commercial obligations and will not be cutting away from the main event. 
They do not know what the word "Holding" means.
If you won't be penalized for it then why not tbh
This whole clock stoppage after a first down is so dumb
What a dumbass
#boo football 
Streaming through your roku versus a computer works wayyyyyyy better
>by Bama
Refs have been all over georgia, but nothing for bama. 
Of course
B1G I think
I didn't know this was the XFL!! Is He Hate Me playing for Bama?
B1G has the worst refs
Georgia's biggest problem is lazy tackling so far. 
To be fair, I've almost never seen them lose their cool like this outside of Troy Brown...
I switched over to the sounds of the game one. Been perfect so far
Still not better than Legarretts 
This thread is hilarious
Might be hired by the end of the game. 
Can''t say I''ve seen Bama play this way, dislike saban but his teams have always been under control 
Hey Bama, humble yourselves
>and was baited by two bama lineman jumpingThat's what I'm saying, it was a false start on Bama, so the ball would have been dead before the snap, thus there's no block either way.
Almost fourth quarter. Please don't falcons this. 
great run stop
Straight trash
Cuz Bama 
Should be conference champions only TBH. It would stop the Alabama bullshit from happening again in the future. Georgia/Oklahoma/Clemson/UCF. Alabama had enough gas for one game after a month of preparation.
Bama's not just losing the game, they're losing respect.
If Bama wins, somehow they will become more hated than they already are.
$$$$$$
I guess Bama players get a pass for putting hands on people on the sidelines?
Funny how every single blatantly missed call in this game has been to Alabama''s advantage
They realized how late it's getting and that it's a weeknight.
They look like spoiled, entitled children.
"getting"
Because maybe it might not be politically correct but I think shoving a small female trainer is a much worse look than shoving a bigger dude.
bama is reforming their clean cut no nonsense image this stuff is crazy
Bama is the spoiled rich kid who gets everything he wants and throws a tantrum at the slightest hint of adversity. 
yeah it's not a good look
After the shit they're getting away with, you're god damn right 
They aren't used to getting their ass straight beaten
Bevell*
NICK SABAN HAS LOST CONTROL OF ALABAMA
SHHHHH Don't tell them
For sure 
I don't disagree. Just left over anger from the head shove 
Why would I be mad lol 
The behavior by the Bama players is embarrassing.
Whatever it is it needs to be trashed.
Choo choo motherfucker!!!
A whole 1, he was penalized on the punch.
Aren't these B1G refs?
That was an utterly embarrassing series of events. How do you come off the bench and possibly get lunch your coach and another player mad?
I'm loving this game now
there is no such thing as pass interference anymore
The hero we need.
Hey.  You watch that talk.Tommy woulda made a *great* ref.
Wow!
Yes it was!
Good point -- Went back and looked at it, and he was right at the line. So probably would've been legal.
Somebody got a replay of the bama dude trying to fight everyone?
What coach was he going after?
Well it is already 10:06 and we havn't even started the 4th yet lol. 
Fake punt with a safety valve
NICE TACKLE
Good point -- Went back and looked at it, and he was right at the line. So probably would've been legal.
That sucks. Is that new? Is there some way to get Reddit to revert that decision?
Alabama might as well have masterminded 9/11 as far as r/CFB is concerned
Hawaiian QB and Greek kicker. That's a cool combo
that's impossible how did he get a yard
Win or lose, Saban is going to murder about 9 players after this game is over 
Wow. He really did take a run at a coach. I seriously want to know what was said to him either on the field or on the sideline that had him that mad. 
I do not like the Alabama football team.
It's a rare occurance
FUCK BAMA!
I'd take a TKO against any Bama player
Lol suck it bama
RUQUAN BABY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Except targeting when it''s not 
if you watched Pac12 football around the time Jared Goff was around, we did it a lot. I think we did it a few times during the USC games too
how to get thrown off your team and never play for a D1 school again 101.
If UGA wins Mike Stoops should be fired.If Bama wins Stoops should still be fired. 
Baker Mayfield's Fried Shoulder Chips, the official sponsor of the 2018 CFP
Great tackle.
Roquan is so dominant
QUANNNNN
That's a beautiful tackle 
Fucking stacked up! 
Obviously Georgia''s bench instigated #48 into throwing a punch/s
DAAAAAMM
Every time I see Georgia's 4 guys line up to stop the run I keep saying to myself "hell no they won't stop shit." And then they get a huge tackle for loss. 
Roquan is a man.
Bama seems content with playing the heel
Bama has so much momentum I''m not even going to lie... 
Nice tackle.
What a stop
Wow what a stop.
WHO ELSE!!! ROQUAN FUCKING SMITH!
This third quarter has lasted forever
smith is just a dam stud dude
Great tackling by Smith tonight damn
I don't watch much Alabama football, are they always this chippy? Or is because they're not used to losing?
where's your first signal now, bo?
NICE DEFENSE!
Roquan Smith! You beautiful beautiful boy!
Great tackle
Damn good stop
The ultra rare run/pass/kick option or rpko
Oklahoma's defense is not doing this to Bama. 
Lol the second Alabama faces any adversity they just start throwing punches and playing dirty. It''s like me in fifa when the cpu scores a goal and I start slide tackling everyone. 
See what you guys are missing by not doing it the soccer way   Pretty free flowing 
Side bets
Watch the shit refs pull their flags out against Georgia.
Calling it, fake right here
Good tackle 
\#3 looked like he heard the play call in the huddle lol
Bama players. Auburn players are used to the disappointment.
anybody who thinks the refs are biased and not simply just bad is fucking stupid
Imagine if Tua had stuck with USC, the CFB world would've lost their fucking minds when he took over Darnold's ESPN cock gobbling throne.
Roquan baby
smith is a fuckin beast.
They''re frustrated. They don''t know how to play from behind. 
Is this your first college football game...ever?
We're playing like hot garbage, and the refs are letting us get away with a lot of stupid stuff
Has Bo been good at all this year?
ROQUAN!!!!!!
I want Georgia to lose but I feel so dirty rooting for the other team 
2 sideline infractions. Haven't heard one of those all year.
Honestly if they keep acting this way I don''t want them to win this game. It''s disgraceful 
Giving the NFL a run for their money 
So... do you not watch much college football or...?
Why did he punch his own teammate? 
SMITH!
BIG BOY FOOTBALL
We have probably one of the lowest ref biases in CFB.  Near the bottom in penalties called for.
come at me
Refs need another sideline penalty to get this game under control
Lights
I think they go for it here.......nope
Alabama should go for it. 
How about maybe YOU chill
Have to move the chains my man
Sigh, B1G refs gonna B1G.
Just saw an Alabama player sad tweeting on the sideline.
Jesus Roquan is unbelievable
lol no
lol where are the Alabama flairs in this thread? They seem to have disappeared.
Roquan Smith has Hall of Fame potential.
Jesus that was a nice tackle on a big man
Fundamental open field tackle
Beast!
ROQUAN
Best sign that Bo has hands all seasn...short of the line.
Commercial quota is split up by half. 4th quarter is gonna be brutal 
Your age is showing lol
Delaney a company man...
Redcoat Band, I love you. But please shut the fuck up or play a different song.
[Me watching these refs](http://m.quickmeme.com/img/0d/0d93543de1468eef79587aeb3cf633fca6a10371afe2b4246423ce4568f09f23.jpg)
Alabama would be down by 20+ if they were not gifted all these bullshit calls by the refs 
That's a huge stop!
I understand this is a championship game and you don''t usually get two teams from the same conference butttt since it is UGA vs Bama; why don''t we have SEC refs?
**Hate feeds the Dawg.**
If Bama comes back to win this, both UCF and these refs might have a better case for national champions.
Let the 48 dude play! 
What an awful playcall
read that all the way what a play
Go for it.
The fake fake
Roquan top 5 pick this year, book it!
Roquan Smith is a goddamn grown ass man.
Nice hit by Roku Stick!
I like it. Means something like the ref tripping while trying to reset the ball doesn't affect the game
I don't like dirty football.  I don't care who the team is.
God this Defense gets me hard
This Georgia D makin' my D hard as hell
Roquan Smith is a beast. 
Kirby is the chosen one
I'm sure commercials in the first half are much more in demand than commercials airing at 11 EST. 
WORST REFFING I HAVE EVER SEEN
I've seen so many I can't even count. Missed calls are just part of the game. Not that they should be, but there's always something missed
It''s the change that needs to go to speed games up 
God Roquan Smith is so good. I''m salivating
I bet the trailer parks in Bama are pretty lit right now. 
great fucking play Smith, WOOT WOOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I'm gonna show my kids that when they learn how to tackle 
This is the longest quarter I've ever seen
Don''t do me like that 
He was playing like doodie
That is pronounced RO-QUAN.
Awesome stop for Smith, 4th down!
Great tackle!!
People have been on the Bama hate train. Right now the refs and certain dumbass players are making it justified.
Lack of institutional control. Death penalty for Alabama confirmed
Thank God it's not NFL rules.
What is going on with the refs. That bama player just pushed the down the helmet of the Georgia player after the play and no unnecessary roughness and then they didn't call pass interference on the next play
Our playcalling is so fucking conservative
Don't be crazy.  They aren't Pac-12 refs. 
Alabamas gonna be demoted to the Pac 12 after this garbage display of football 
Fuck these refs 
Now where the fuck is Damien Harris?
Me too! btw, hello Ram family :)
What is 34 year old Alabama RB Bo Scarborough majoring in?
He'd better be talented as fuck because after that shit I can't imagine many coaches outside of JuCo will want him
Im tired of this 8:30 kickoff on a Monday. I never make it
I'll be honest I'm just wondering what happened to 48.
Form tackling is good
Gee I needed another reason to hate Alabama /s
Draft Roquan Elway
RS3!!!
Jesus Christ...
Boomer sooner and tomahawk chop are by far the worst...
Smith is unbelievable. 
Good hit let's get some points.
WOW Bulldogs are playing at incredibly high level. 
Joking right?Do people root for Vader to fuck their girlfriend? 
Let the hate consume you
I like how your go-to dirty team is the Mormons.
Yep...back to the vodka.
That tackle form is perfect
Just hit me this is the last quarter for 9 months. 
That was a huge tackle.
Bama is 2/10 on 3rd down conversions
FIRE MIKE STOOPS
i wanna see this too
I have to disagree
Been watching you kids for years, for as great as Saban is his teams have never been the most disciplined by a longshot.**Especially under pressure
Fuck man, Calvin Ridley would have soooooo many more yards if this dude was starting at QB all season
them dawgs is hell
YES! Great stop from Smith!
Roquan *Shut Down* Smith
ROQUANNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN
Sumlin talking about how the center was eligible due to the tackle being off the ball so I think it was. 
To be fair, they aren't used to losing
Takes forever 
That''s all I''m here for
No joke about them being Michigan grads?
This is one of the best national championship games I've seen.  Lots of pro level, intelligent talent on both sides of the ball from both teams.
Amazing how fast Roquan read that
Lol no need to worry about that any time soon
I''m ashamed that I called for Saban to put Tua in after that quick shot of Hurts on the sideline. He looked absolutely mortified. People seem to forget that kids playing a damn game isn''t all that important in the grand scheme of things. Good night y''all.
I missed what Brown did to get him off the field in the first place before attempting to punch his coach. What I miss?
Soooo, we''re all going for them to not do that...
Yeah. Weird. 
Made me laugh LOL
Unironically is. Refs have been seriously injured running into people. 
if they thought Tua was the better QB why didnt they start him from the jump...benching your QB at halftime in the CFBNCG seems ridic
Roquan Smith is always everywhere, making every playI hate him
Is there anything different this year that explains why this Bama team seems so uncharacteristically undisciplined?Is it a bunch of young guys or something?
Can we give a Lb MVP?
is there a reason the ref is standing right in the middle of traffic?
I don't think it's bias, I just think these refs are really fuckin bad
 Nah at least 2 in like 2 minutes. 
I''m gonna be salty as hell if Bama wins. Lost lots of respect for those fellas
Looks like Georgia is pulling an Atlanta Falcons.
https://twitter.com/Sports_Burd/status/950578597932294146
Iron Bowl this year was glorious. I''ve never seen a Nick Saban team this undisciplined before this year
Play something else. Literally anything else
Next week on ESPN: Bama melting down, Saban wouldn't name Hurts Patriot of the Week
Oh wait a sec isn't he the best linebacker ?
Something got to them... its ever since that last td.. maybe it was the td? idk
We are all UGA fans today
This is what you get when you have an all SEC natty. Enjoy. 
See y'all in the 4th quarter thread
Dear Netflix,Please hold a free seminar on how to properly stream content. Dear ESPN,I hear Netflix might have a free seminar that you should be interested in. 
Seahawks south
Oh damn!
So it''s pronounced **Tung**ovailoa?
Kirby Smart fixing to Luke Skywalker Smith Lord Saban.
Saban leads by fear, not inspiration. At least that's how it seems
I've seen worse...
I like BAMAS chances here compared to yours..douchebag
smith is a beast
I wonder what Kiffin is doing right about now
Yeah their coach is awful 
Ramsey had the option if it was open. our FB and the snapper were eligible receivers. 
I'd eat some of those 
Because you are there to be aggressive
This is such an unbelievably boring game
Acting like sore losers in the 3rd Q of the National Championship is the most Bama thing ever
Roquan is a tackling machine
I''ve seen targeting calls upheld that were less against the players head than that push 
I feel sorry for the band.  They be playing songs every damn second.  Poor guys prob just wanna watch the game but they gotta be concentrating on their bangers 
That is football porn Roquan. What a talented fuckin player 
Beautiful tackle
What tackling! 
Fucking stopped in their dirty tracks.
Same! I've never seen so many Bama players act like complete fools.
I agree with you tbh I'm just not surprised it wasn't called
#NEW THREAD 
GRUDEN DRAFT ROQUAN K THX
Roquan be like “yo receiver, I know you had nothing to do with being dirty as all get out a second ago, but ima make you pay for it anyway.”
Still here...
damn, he read that so well.
Hey so what's up with these refs?
Roquan is ridiculous.
Great fuckin play
42 should be given his scholarship.
that's because they're probably all used to winning so much and blowing out opponents that when someone comes to challenge them and does they dont know what to do
Making us look bad :/ They usually aren't this terrible. 
New I think with the app. You can complain to the admins, but not sure what good it will do unless it gets a lot of traction.
My god.
Go for it 
Ayy, Go Cats!
Why
goddamn Roquan is so beastly
1st half was great defense but this 2nd half is amazing.
Georgia is DESTROYING Bama, zebras are the only thing keeping them in the game
Jesus Bama is busting at the seams right now 
I'd be all for two commecial-free halves with 45 minutes of commercials at half. 
And for Bama Fromm tackling is good
LOL!
What a hit, damn
The Alabama O and D-lines are getting whooped
High IQ by that kid who avoided the pick 
So basically Joffrey from GoT?
Nick Saban is like Red Beaulieu
If they go to commercial with 8 seconds left ill kill em
Punt game is strong
Alabama making us fans look bad by playing like jackass punks out there.
they just intentionally make games closer 
Scary shit.
Oh my goodness, I hope he's okay
Fuck that dudes dead
Nah
longest 3rd quarter ever
And we all thought that Houston would be the college football villain
Nice stop
Lmao what a dumbass
Me too
[deleted]
I think that title still belongs to the PAC
I like this answer the best
Alabama DB collapses? 
Bama desperately needs to start scoring, UGA will do some Georgia Big Play^tm at some point.
Can anyone explain why Hurts was pulled? WTF
Tired 
If both bands are gonna play the same song the entire game, just let Kendrick be the bands at this point
Damn, major props to the bulldogs defenese
o shit
Holy shit 
They have no clue how to play from behind. 
I'm stunned that a Nick saban coached team is acting like this.I bet more than just 48 loses his spot on the team.
Hope that fuckstick that just threw 2 punches never plays another down of football again.    No place for that against either the opponent or your own coaches.    Piece of trash.  
Oh Jesus, that''s awful 
I'm fine with that. 
THEYRE NOT THAT SMART.
What the fuck...?!
Coming into this game, everyone thought that Saban would shut down Kirby because he knew how he played.Turns out Kirby shuts down Saban cause he knows how he plays.
Fuck man hope that guys ok
that's heat stroke
Hope that dudes ok
Oh shit that's not good. I hope the kid is ok.
Wtf is happening on the Bama sidelines
Why aren't you trolling with your other account?
Umm no 
Pls be okay big guy
heat stroke?
Oh shit
Holy shit hope that guy is ok. 
Holy shit what's going on
Um what the fuck
Can''t pin that on the whole team.
They are quickly changing back to FSU flairs.
We need him in Carolina. Pls. 
is McDonald ok??
Saban must be absolutely terrifying when he has a chance to tee off on some fuckin bone head like #48. 
48 probably punched him
Hope that kid is OK
damn that's scary.. 
Oh fuck
WHAT IS GOING ON?!?!?
More like SEC Beast amiright 
The Roquan
he actually had someone pull him back!
A dude collapsed!?Hope you're okay, young man.
The players wear suits for their team photos but attack coaches on the sidelines. Conflicting imagery. 
Please make this kid ok.
I'm not exaggerating when I say this, but Roquan Smith could bring peace to the middle East. There's nothing this man can't do. 
I'm gonna run straight into this mass of like 8 O and D-Line and see what kind of yardage i can get. 
Roquan is more fun to say with a rolled r
Ruh roh 
uh..stop the game maybe?
Oh shit, hope that kid is alright.
48 probably sucker punched him 
1 on 1 open field tackles against notoriously hard to tackle players are real sexy
Oh shit hope that dude is okay.
Man, I hope he''s ok
Collapses on sideline? Wut
If Georgia can score a TD on this drive it's over. Come you got this Georgia.
Getting real sick of Kirk calling everyone special 
Roquan is a Baby Keuchly
The fuck is going on?
jesus hope the guy is okay
r/madlads
We been on the hate train boi.
Why is that?
How so?
I hope that kid is ok
wtf... what happened... pause the game
Oh, that's really bad
Roquan's ability to tackle in space without giving up yardage is incredible 
it's not murder if it's ritual sacrifice
Momma still loves you...
Umm you watching the game?
Refs are treating UGA like they''re Western Michigan 
This is scary.
Oh no, fuck
holy shit
Scary :(
WAIT WTF PLEASE TELL ME WE WILL STOP THIS GAME THIS KID IS HAVING A FUCKING HEART ATTACK
Dawgs are everything I want in a football team and Fromm spinning the ball in his hands before throwing it is so cool. 
Refs have missed about 5 penalties on Bama so far
Overheated?
Oh fuck I hope that kid's okay
...You guys, is Kirby the Devil? Has he come to call at last for that deal Saban made...?
Oh shit hope that kids ok.
Check @SInow on Twitter 
I wouldn't wish that on my worst enemy, cuz Colorado is already in the Pac12
H8 FEEDS THE DAWG
Woah holy crap. Really hope that kids okay
That's scary holy shit
Should have gone for the first 
[deleted]
Oh shit, be ok dude please
ooph prayers with Kyriq Mcdonald--looks bad
Jesus, you hope it's just dehydration
Get a IV started
Bama is a bad state
That tackle was so fucking gorgeous
I want Roquan on the Cowboys so badly ;_; 
Who would win? 1 multiple-season starter for an all-time, historically great programor1 wavy boi 
This is a crazy game. So much weird stuff.
Damn that's scary as shit. I hope that kid is okay.
*SCREAMING* 
reminds me of Coach K and Duke really
It seriously looks like Saban has lost control of this game
Nah Colts draft.
Damn, hope this guy is ok.
I hope if UGA wins, at the handshake Kirby says "Now...*I* am the master" in Darth Vader's voice
Raquon Smith with some huge stops these last two weeks.
Alabama is slowly gaining momentum again. Sure, they didn't score points, but they flipped the field.
Jesus... Poor kid.  Hope he's OK.
Oh fuck. That is not good. 
Bama is a circus this gamehope that dude is ok
Did he get punched by 48?
Bo is a big boy, nice tackle
Oh shit, that's terrible
Wow. Scary.  I hope that player is okay. 
This game is getting wild for all the wrong reasons
Is Greg Davis calling for Alabama?
oh no
Welcome to Bama loving
For real, we should look into that
#nextlevel
Holy shit what's going on?
Roquan, you beautiful fuckin' sonuvabitch!
Jesus. That's scary
Cause its a highly anti Alabama thread, why participate? 
THE QUICKNESS
You are so unbelievably wrong. 
Oh my god I hope he is okay.
UCF WANTS GEORGIA
Roquan my favorite 
Damn I am way more impressed by Oklahoma after seeing this game
And #2 still makes contact with with the player after the fair catch. Not anything hard, but Alabama just does not have it in themselves to play clean. 
All we doing is doing little passes tot he outside like every play.
WTF is happening with Alabama
We are more penalized than Georgia. What are you talking about? I know we are playing trashy but don't make it sound like Georgia is a victim. Realistically not all called get made. Chill. Bama is still showing their ass.
Oh shit. Hope he's ok, that's scary as shit.
Ah man I hate injuries, please be okay dude.
Hope that kid is alright.
Please be okay.
That''s shitty... 
"Yo, dial it back it a bit. This shit's not believable." ~ Villains in every sports movie
Too much SEC bias in these refs
fuck this is scary, collapsed
Jeez, hope the kid's okay
Godspeed bro
Damn what the hell happened to him
Game seems to be getting more physical as it goes on .. maybe Bama is frustrated.
I got bored with it lol. 
That''s bad
oh god, prayers up
Prayers up
Hoping that Bama player turns out ok
That poor man never had a chance. 
Awwww he gave him a mid-air full speed hug. Cute!
lol punter just trolling...."Imma throw it...Imma throw it...nah just kidding I'm kicking"
Shit that's scary. 
Damn was he in the game earlier?
Oh fuck hope that kids ok
The game was scheduled to end at 11:15 btw guys. This isn't ending until 12 at least
Shit that's accurate
They are hotheads and overrated as fuck.
Hope that young man is okay
Man. I hope he's okay. 
Yikes. Hope that guy's alright
Wtf is going on on Bamas sideline 
Pre workout is 2 strong
Man, that third quarter was nearly an hour long. 
oh god. i hope he's ok.
How did he get hurt on the sideline?
Hopefully the guy who collapsed isn't hurt too badly 
Damn, Alabama, everything is collapsing around you.
Gerontology?  
I think Nick Saban might just be getting old. I wonder if this is one of the first signs of the end?
I hear they're planning something called a 9/11 Holocaust
oh man hope he's ok
WTF just happened? 
He's alert so that's good 
Jesus Christ what is going on
At least hes sitting up!
First SEC game? Announcers call that "very physical". 
What are you watching?
Oh shit... Hope he's ok. Get well big man
Damn that''s scary as shit. Hope he''s just dehydrated or something 
I hope that guy is okay 
Georgia doesn''t even care that the refs are on Bama''s side. They''ll fight erbody. These boys wildin.
Hopefully that isnt as serious as it sounds. 
We are used to this.
Jesus Christ what is happening
Did y'all know Smith won the Butkus award?
[removed]
Lol, what an idiot.  Thanks for the link.
Alabama's sideline is fucking intense
I really really hope that Bama guy is okay. You never wanna see someone collapse on the sideline.
Oh god that''s scary- hope the kid is okay
Who is down on the sideline?
oh shit, please be okay
Hope he''s ok
Boooooooooo
oh shit thats not good
Hope that dude is okay
OK, Bama's sideline has officially gone off the rails.Hope that kid is OK.
Fuck this game is getting weird. 
I'm no expert but I would say Georgia has a pretty decent defense
Grady getting some nice publicity 
Holy crap. Hope he's ok
When it rains it pours
Oh shit. That doesn't look good. 
Ya know it's bad when AJ MCCARRON says it's a missed call. 
Writing up some tweets.
I respect it, sorry for my salt
What is going on on bamas sideline? 
This WatchESPN app aint shit
wait whos on a stretcher? what happened?
Goddamn Roquan and Fromm playing so great tonight.
Stabbed by one of his own players
Damn hope he''s okay
There giving water, so hopefully that''s all it is 
Same.  :(
Dude prob didnt eat before the game and low blood sugar caused him to pass out.
At least he's conscious, thats fuckin scary. 
That's awful. 
Dude was a heat seeking missile on that 3rd down.
Fuck, please be okay 
Stop fucking showing the kid that collapsed.
It''s Alabama... are you expecting a genius?
https://twitter.com/CFBgifer/status/950578476657987584
*this is not about the injury. This is about the implosion that is the Bama offense and decision making 
Ball don''t lie?
Take his ass to grady asap get him some medical care
LAST
This hard on for Georgia is hilarious. Thought y'all weren't gonna watch the game huh?
Ugh that sounds terrible. Hope he's okay
Holy shit I hope he's ok
Why the fuck was that not a flag!?! Oh ya. Alabama. 
What happened??? Just saw Grady and a gurney out there
Number 48 punched him, that's why he collapsed.
same
I'll never understand, on a third down, why you would throw a pass that doesn't at least make it to the line to gain. 
Why the hell is the band so loud on the broadcast between plays. Anyone else notice it?
Oh shit prayers for him. At least he looks aware
Damn that''s terrifying 
R O Q U A N
After this game errybody gonna want Bama.
Shit hope he''s ok 
Bama players are acting like the title is a right and start pitching a fit when they realize they'll have to earn it
Maybe BYU is dirty but UNC is the team that's classless
Former band member. More than easy enough to keep an eye on the game while playing. 
Can confirm have seen some... interesting... snap stories. Source: live in Bama
he was playing really badly
Hope he's alright
Oh shit I hope he is okay. We forget in the game, but that's someone's kid.
Man, I was definitely rooting for Georgia before this game started, but I didn't have strong feelings. Now I just want to watch Bama get stomped.
Saban must have looked at him angrily and he passed out
Well that''s scary. I hope he''s alright 
Holy shit hope that kid is okay.
Why aren't they stopping game for that?Hope he's alright.
Wtf is going on over on that Bama sideline tonight??
Damn Bama, hope your guy is okay. That sucks
Damn that''s scary hope it''s nothing serious
In terms of places I've traveled, I do like Alabama more than Georgia.But I have weird tastes. I want a state to show me something natural, like ass with some stretch marks.
Oh shit, hope he's ok.
Oh man that''s not good. Hang in there bud
can i please be last
we were spoiled by the rose bowl. no football game will ever be the same.
bamas playcalling is not what you would expect from a team filled with 5*'s. let your dick hang daboll
Jesus, hope the guys ok!
New thread time!
Well aren't you just a chatty cathy?
#48 got him.
What is going on with this game. I'm expecting a cow to fly in on a parachute. :o 
That's not good, be ok Bama guy
Bama sideline has been wild today. Hope that kid is okay 
oh shit dude was probably dehydrated or some kind of heat injury, get better dude
Fuck that's scary, hope he's okay
As a Gators and Bucs fan there would be no words that could describe the sexual pleasure I would get from this happening
Really good news that guy is up and conscious 
UGAs run game has been weak tonight
hope that guy is okay, thats scary man
Uh, well I hope he's okay.  Get him some fluids and hopefully he's ok
If you don't like great defense, you don't like football.
Hope he's okay
Holy shit dude.... 
You gonna eat that? 
I have no idea. Some drama maybe? Something set 48 off, but this is a first all year. Might be nerves. 
Some dude just collapsed on the sideline 
Wow that kinda puts this whole game into perspective 
Bad juju on those Bama sidelines. 
Somebody forgot to stay hydrated. Hope he's ok
Poor kid, hope he''s fine 
Hope that kid is alright. 
Eh maybe some. That's mostly in the backwoods. 
48 beat someone up? 
Hope that kid on the sideline is alright thats some scary shit
Saban needs to call some  trickeration. 
holy shit whats' happening with the stretcher out there
I am enjoying Mr. SEC''s wild ride.
Yes!
[Here's the part where he swings at a coach.](https://twitter.com/cjzero/status/950578190271074304) There was more though.
Jerkin it in San Diego. 
What the hell is happening this game?  So much crazy shit.  Hope that player on the sideline is okay.
Nick Saban's always been vulnerable to teams with good throwing quarterbacks. So this is not a surprise.
Who was that?
yep. sounds like it. The iced soak towels are a decent indicator. 
Hot take
Woah
It is amazing how well watchespn gets every second between plays but none of the actual plays, holy fucking shit.  
roquan smith is going to be a top 5 pick in the draft holy shit all he does is make plays
Damn that''s scary : / hope he turns out ok

Edit: player collapsed.
What the fuck is happening on the Alabama sideline??!
Shit got real 
Holy shit. Be okay, young man.
Thats scary as shit.
Hope dude is ok

C'mon man, the Falcons!
hey thanks ESPN ,im sure his parents are not freaking out right now say his name over and over 
Oh shit. Hope he's okay.
no opt is a great game 
Or panic attack, don't forget these are 18-22 year old kids
What happened on the sideline?
One of your DBs collapsed on the sidelines
Fuck I hope that Bama player is okay 
Hope he is okay
Dang that's scary
Everyone put 4 fingers to the sky...IT IS THE 4th QUARTER!
The real mvp
I hope that bama back is ok :(
17K comments. How many will 4Q get?
Oh shit, that''s not good 
That''s what I was thinking. It''s probably pretty warm in that stadium. 
If we can give a punter mvp....

Hope he''s alright. 
NCAA 2005 Update: Since this IRL title game is taking so long I'm going to play on to week 9 of the 2018 season and see how far I get before the end of the game. Today we have the Game of the Decade in Video Game Land as my #1 Gators (5-0) go on the road to take on #3 Arkansas (4-0). The Gators won the toss so as usual I elected to kickoff so I get the ball to start the 2nd half. Game on!
Future Miami Dolphin, Roquan Smith. 
probably not
Woah, he just collapsed? Holy hell, hope he's alright.
48 bad
Wow, I hope he's okay. That seems really serious. 
84 punched him :(
Yes
But he's a TRUE FRESHMAN!
 I really hope we see at least seven more punts by the end of this game 
I would like 1 Da'Ron Payne on my team please
Money time
Lol no, advertisers gonna get theirs
I hope McDonald is okay. Scary stuff.
This game has been chippy all over
Hope the kid is ok. 
Oh shit. What the hell? 
No it isn''t.
I am but a mere cfb fan, not an attorney. Thank you for the clarification. 
Obvious penalties. The worst being that face mask
TO THE FOURTH QUARTER THREAD!!!!!!!
Fromm is going to run for 200 yds in the fourth 
We still here?
what's up with these basic azz runs up the middle? bama is reading it every time, it's such a waste of a down
God damn what's going to happen next on the bama side line?
I learned that it can just take minutes before brain cells start to die from heat stroke. Be okay big dude. I hope it's not that.
Hope that kid on the Bama sideline is ok
Holy shit, a collapse like that is some scary shit.
1 more quarter Georgia Bros!
^Under DAWGS
I like cheese
 More quarter 
Anyone know what happened to him?
Punched a Georgia player in the head
woosh
I'd hate to be his family and only have that much info. 
Hope that bama player is ok
inb4 next year when the committee lets 2 loss bama in for shits and gigs over undefeated ucf/Pac12 team
Now this is redditing
Oh for sure. I shouted at my TV. How the hell do you miss that right in front of your face?!?! And I thought they were trying to protect quarterbacks. These refs are pure straight trash. Bama getting all the calls 
Somebody collapsed off the field? That''s frightening. Good vibes and juju sent toward that kid 
I hope McDonald is ok. That's scary that he collapsed. 
Alabama''s pets heads are fallin'' off!!!!!
fire
What happened there?
Tried to go after a coach on the sidelines
Oooo man, that is no joke. really hope he's ok.
What happened to the injured guy? 
Freshman defensive back collapsed
Who collapsed on the sideline?
Surely not. It's pretty cold down here right now. Maybe dehydration?
B1G
As is tradition 
This is the most bizarre game. 
He punched a Georgia player
What the fuck happened to him?
Georgia was double digits underdogs?! Shit I should've taken that 
This game is really a soap opera tbh
But can he see why kids love the taste of Cinnamon Toast Crunch?
Bama has a great run defense.
I hope he just locked his legs and it's nothing more serious like heat stroke or heart murmur. 
TURBO TAX
What the fuck happened?
Prayers up for that dude
Kid seemed to at least be sitting up and not totally unconscious. 
If a player collapses on the sideline, I feel like they should stop the game at least.
Fuck, that's really scary
He's doing his research project on the fountain of youth
i was wondering that too man .. lettin them play is one thing, but dont wanna see someone get taken out from a cheap shot
You''re probably right. I honestly have no idea who that player is.
Four fingers up
Last?
reminds me of another championship game :(
Yeah, but they aren't kids. 
Ya think? That kid 48 was trying to fight a coach.
Last
Don't lock your knees, silly.
Anarchy
As is TrAdition 
Arguably soccer players diving, surrounding the referee for every call and generally being babies about everything. Its a different kind of worst attitude but terrible none the less. 
Watch NBA much? 
this is such a weird game
Every time I think Bama is maybe about to capture the momentum, Georgia steps up. 
Get that kid an IV
Backup DB
Fuck excessive commercials
I would hate trying to fair catch a punt in a game like this. 
Prayers for Kyree
Timeout
They could do some damage in the SunBelt. Maybe play in three Camelia bowls in a row.
[The one with a crimson pullover](https://imgur.com/6mrHPeL)
We need to figure out some offense and quick. 
For Fucks sake guys this guy could actually be having a cardiac issue have some fucking decency and stop the game
YO MAMA
Poor Georgia like, "If we block it they'll just call offsides anyway" on that punt. 
Bama is a mess right now
I can''t stand this runs up the middle inside the 5.. It''s a waste of a down ffs.
Hopefully he just locked his legs too long and blacked out.
Thankfully he''s moving
Been that way all season. I've been unimpressed with reffing. The amount of no calls.
Stagnant offense in the 1st half
cause he was ass
Bama player collapsed and is on the ground
Shoved a GA player then tried to punch a coach -- one of his own.Try a different browser.  The default is new so something's wrong on your end.  
Hey man. Fuckkkkkkkkkkk youuuuuuuuuuu. 
As much as I love Sammy D, ESPN's Lebron-esque level of scrutiny and glorification for the kid wore me thin immediately. I honestly feel bad for all that unnecessary pressure and spotlight they put on him.
[deleted]
Who is down on the sideline?
Nah, but he''s nice. 
Ok is every player in this game a freshman? Seriously though, hope he is ok. That sounds bad.
seems a little odd not to stop play until they can get the collapsed player off the sideline
Come on Dawgs let's finish this. Bama doesn't deserve this win. 
i wish i could transfer his injury to the refs
praying that kid doesnt have a DJ Hayden situation
48 probably knocked him out
This not good
Hope he's ok
Alabama sideline spOOky
Damn, hope McDonald is okay, injuries or anything like that fucking suck, prayers.
Switch the the Spanish stream. Plays flawlessly. ESPN is incompetent. 
Mmm but fuck Alabama 
Shit man its like none of this matters when that guy is on the ground having a heart attack or something.
Probably dehydration and overheating
HUZZAH!
 But how many more commercials?
Freshman corner, McDonald 
I have work at 12!
its fucking Bama
Yea and Bama looks to have the momentum.
Did 48 stab that kid?
MODS, DONT BE LATE AGAIN
Oh shit it's bad when Grady shows up
For now
84 hitting a coach 
Shit. The McDonald stuff sucks. I hate injuries. 
Despite Alabama and the refs best efforts, UCF are still the national champions
Roquan Smith is such a fantastic LB. Dude is going top ten for sure
game has everything...  offense, defense, fights, sideline drama...
This is the craziest game.....wtf.That''s scary
Oh fuck.  Hope that kid is ok
oh damn, hope he's okay. Wonder what happened.
Oh my goodness, I hope that kid is okay. I''m skittish from what happened to that poor basketball player a few weeks ago...
As far as I'm aware it's not super hot there, but he could very well be either super dehydrated or having a vasovagal response from standing with his legs locked for a long time
Sound Mixing
Exactly Bama is starting to play a little dirty now
Damn.  Overheated maybe?  Hope he's ok
This game is gonna end with a fight.
YO DADDYS SON
Honestly what I thought at first
I hope we get an update on the guy on the sidelines
Shit, sidelines are the real danger zone tonight
Oh shit hope he's ok
Saben's rage consumed its first life 
Please be the Raiders that take him.
touche
Hoping the Bama player gets up and shakes his thang.
Never understood why the game continues when that type of situation is going on the sideline.
I have inner turmoil about the fact that I love watching football so much, yet absolutely couldn't bear to see my future kids play it.
yikes, hope the kids OK
DirectTV sucks
Goodbye thread
Roquan Smith helped me cook my dinner, clean my apartment, and still found a way to get in the backfield to make that tackle. Truely does it all.
As is tradition
Lol that would be a site to see
For a minute I thought you were talking about football and I was all "was that in 1923 or something????"
Oh no, I hope that kid is alright. Hopefully he's just overheated and needs extra hydration and a breather.
So was #48 going after Saban or that black assistant?
Looked like he was mouthing at Saban a few seconds before he swung on the other coach
Fuck the game, just keep a camera on the Bama sideline... the last 10 minutes have been insane over there.
Please be ok 
This has been the most eventful second half of football I've ever seen in my life and we're only just ending the third quarter.
aww snap someone got suckered punched by 48
Hi
28 freshman linebacker
It doesn't even seem like it's game related, which is extra scary. You hear stories about people just collapsing and dying
I always instinctively root for the team that is trailing, I have to keep reminding myself that that team is fucking Alabama 
I feel like they should be acting with more urgency if someone collapses. You got undiagnosed heart conditions and all kinds of shit that can happen
So what time do yall think this game will end? 
[deleted]
punched someone in the facemask
Yeah I usually love the Tide, but I'm not really rooting for them tonight. How they're playing isn't cool
Benched starting QB, player swinging at his coach, and now a player collapses on the sideline? This quarter is a doozy.
PF for punching a GA player, should have been ejected
No shitI don''t even like watching games now if anyone gets hurt seriously 
Nick Saben out here stealing the souls of players and selling them to the devil for a touchdown
My guess is some sort of infraction
I missed it, did he collapse on the side line? 
Ugh. This thread is insufferable. I just want to talk football with fellow football fans, even through the ups and downs of my own team, but it's becoming impossible. I get it. You hate us. I get it, you think the game is rigged. Can we please move on?
DILLY 
He's acting like that's the main event. It's interesting, but the game is more important. Talk about that
The combine will say a lot TBH. 
hungry?
Wow hope that guy's alright.
Especially if Bama keeps playing like this
It was supposed to be a fake punt that turned into a real punt. Not bad considering he salvaged a bad fake punt.
BECAUSE REDCOATS
Alabama is paying the refs, evidently Georgia is paying hitmen.
I love Tessitore''s enthusiasm. Paired with Amin''s wit and no-nonsense approach, those are two of my favorite announcers and have a serious future.
Bama is playing dirty and the refs are payed off
Damn. Hope he's alright. 
Last
Agreed!
They're indoors
This is the most NFL game of the season. College football overall is miles beyond the NFL in producing entertaining games week in and week out
fuck, stop showing us footage of them preparing him for the stretcher. hope he is okay. 
Cmon mods where''s the new thread
Last?
Got the vapors. 
Nah
There''s a great UGA podcast called Chapel Bell Curve that features a band assistant, and he''s constantly talking abouthow they''re really dang proud of what they do and how awesome they were all day at the Rose Bowl. I bet they''re loving it.
FORM TACKLE!
The latter. Saban teams are always disciplined. This is fucking nuts 
Games like this will allow that one Bama fan to enjoy the Outback Bowl in the future.
Honestly they''ve been sucking Bama off pretty hard this game. Really frustrating to watch. 
Bad news, buddy, there's no Greyhound direct from Atlanta to Tuscaloosa. We're gonna have to route you through Fayetteville. 
Bring back College football video games 
I hope that's all it is
It's a show for sure. Hope that kid is ok.
YOU CAN'T TELL ME WHAT TO DO. YOU'RE NOT MY REAL DAD.
Yeah. Looks like the kid is riding to Grady so he's in very good hands.
I was just wondering
Time for a patriots!
Playing inside a dome
You're there to play football not shove people's heads into the ground
A D S A D S #ADS ADS ADS!

So, teams not the the SEC?
SEC refs smh
Freshman collapsed on the sideline. 
Any Alabama fans with any insight into any potential reasons why that kid collapsed? 
I'll take one Smith for the Saints please
If you're wondering how much bad luck Bama has had with injuries, we just had a man fall out on the sideline.  
They might not even update us on his actual condition till fhe end of the game because theres too much money to be lost...fuck
bye bitches
To the 4th we go. 
Love you Irish bros!
A guy collapsed
You know they were. Any threads to hate on Bama will always be full of weird ass Ohio State fans. 
Wouldn't be surprised if 48 sucker punched him and dropped him.
I'M TELLIN YOU THAT VISOR'S COMIN OFF
KRYPTON TIME!!! Lights up bitches. Also hope the Alabama player is okay. 
One more to go fellas
How are Georgie underdawgs? Lol
When your players play like that why would anyone root for them
It was pretty close to PI though... go watch that replay again, man. He was pushing him before he had touched the ball. Horrible officiating for a championship game.
This game is fucking wild. Drama on the field is being rivaled by everything on the sideline. Hope that kid is okay. 
Yeah hoping it's just dehydration 
Sounds like you give a fuck who wins 
shit that's bad
SPIDERMAN IS MY DADDY
Yes
It''s sad but that was my first thought as well. 
One kid loses his mind and the whole team is responsible? 
Punched a Georgia player first
I''m nervous! Georgia bros how are y''all holding up?
*holds up four fingers*
What a game 
Punched a guy on the field, then pushed a coach down on their own sideline 
Watch some B1G games. It gets worse...
No.

It's the B1G refs lol
8 points last I saw.
Georgia: Got any quarterbacks?Alabama: Yeah, we got Tua them!
A bama player just collapsed apparently. Scary shit
Pet Peeve: Everyone holding up 4 like its more significant to their team than the other team.
what happened to that guy?
That's what I was thinking, I wonder if they should stop play. That looks pretty scary.
Ya 
Kyriq McDonald 
The first half was, not anymore.
Hope that Bama player is alright. :(
I hope that DT for Bama is OK.
I wouldn't be able to play more football without Grady.
Why do some players hold up what quarter they're going into?
I'm evil because I laughed at this
Hope you lose :)
It''s UGA +3.5
"USE TAX ACT AND YOU COULD BE AN ICE CREAM MAN TO CHILDREN IN THE MIDDLE OF A FIELD."
B1G if true
LOL
Fingers crossed
This is the most drama I have ever seen from a Saban coached team. WTF is going on.
I hope that isn''t anything like a floppy heart valve. That''s the age for it to show. :(
This is good
Lane Kiffin was Bama''s ace in the hole every game. Say what you want about Kiffin he was one heck of a offensive coordinator.
Bama player collapsed on the sideline.
The latter. Saban teams are always disciplined. This is fucking nuts 
Ugh no; 4.
except when we go 14-0 in 2 years
Yes
4 points up until the start of the gameE: autocorrect a word
Are we getting a fourth quarter thread or did mods fall asleep?
Inside...
Yeah I haven't been impressed with him. 
Scary stuff with #26(?). Game aside, hope he's alright.
What the fuck is going on with Alabama right now lol
Why cant Saban ever recruit a qb? 
yessir
Kyriq McDonald, if I'm not mistaken.  Freshman DB.
B1G refs bribed by Oklahoma?
No they were +4
They were +4.5 on Bovada
I thought it was -4 bama.... not double digits 
SEE FROMM IN THE FOURTH
When there''s no more room in hell, Alabama will walk the Earth.
Yes 
Yeah unknown why 
There is just way too much happening right now. 
Please
Good to see other Cats fans! Sometimes I feel alone in this world
That's scary, hope that back is ok.
Prayers out to that young man. Scary stuff.
I also have a laggy espn stream
Welcome to the bama hate club. It''s standard procedure when they are on the losing end of things.
see you. it's a ten-point game, it could go either way at this point
Third Quarter: 50% football game, 50% reality TV show.
Let that be private. Why report that dude collapsing 
Hopefully that kid is just overheated. Though it''s likely Saban just made another sacrifice right there on the sidelines 
DAWGS!!! ONE MORE QUARTER!!!
This game has gone of the rails. 
Bang
What happened?  Nothing showed on skycam
Bama sideline in shambles.
last!!
Coach was ready to rumble
iirc it was Bama -4
Long as Bama loses, I''m ok. 
I think Herby said the flag was across the field on the 50, which doesn't make sense. 
Shit I hope that kid is OK. 
Did 48 punch out that dude 
is the guy in the tax act ice cream truck the same guy from the iphone x commercial?

Ehh Bama is one of the premier rush defenses and also Georgia hasn''t been going to the outside much (I''d say look for that a bit more this quarter)
If your username was 360noscope420blazeit, it would probably just appear for you.
Mods are being slower than these refs. 
give the man some air christ 
Fully certain UCF should be here not Bama 
Yea im guessing dehydration
I love it. This must be what it's like to watch Saban play against a legit team. 
That''s what it sounded like.
Yeah
I love it
Usually the defense is playing back and you're just hoping the receiver can pick up the yards after catch.
at least 12 comments.
Hah. That was just crazy. I recognize some of us don't quite know how to control ourselves... but attacking your coach on sideline and pushing a trainer out of the way. Wow
Oh man, with all the hate for Bama let's hope that player is okay
HAS ANYONE CHECKED JALENS SCREENSAVER?  WHAT IS IT NOW?
Hope that player is ok and it''s just precautionary 
hope the dude on the Alabama side line is ok. 
Those few minutes without commercials were absolutely priceless

Yea I'm turning this game off. I'm nota fan of either team but if they are just gonna do this helping bama shit over and over again then I'm out.We get it you gotta keep the game close but if you shove the back of a players head while he's down, that's a penalty. 2 penalties for sideline shit? Seriously just give bama the god damn trophy of you want them to have it so much.
Thread locked
It was Bama -4
I'm in
Saban step over McDonald too?  Or did he Learn  that humans hate that at the dolphins?
If EMS is out there, they're gonna take him to the hospital just in case.
Drunk and cold and anxious. Basically just kinda shaking.

Your life is hard :(
you can''t explain that! 
Bama missing Kiffin right now
Been there done that ;) lol
Between. Every. Fucking. Play.Not that hearing the same song 80 times a night isn't great or anything.
He was playing horribly. Standing in the pocket and taking sacks. Not even trying to evade them. He needed to go, to try and light a fire under the offense's butt, cause they were not in this game.
That''s Roquan goddamn Smith. Linebacker and tackling machine haha
A conference champion. 
Waiting on you mods! 
It seems like there's more stuff going on on the sidelines than the actual game right now
Sony Michel vs the Microsoft stacked box
All the shit on the Bama sideline makes me think that Saban's getting all of his debts with the devil called in. 
That girl loves meat, lucky guy

Last comment?
DILLY DILLY
Because otherwise you throw it away or take a negative play. Dropping it off like that at least gives a chance for the player to make a play
because often the defense is playing closer to the line of gain and if the WR catches beforehand he'll often have to just dodge one player to get that down. It was a good call, Dawgs just played better defense. 
Should be 20-17.  I hate that this feels like last year all over again.  
Don't worry. There's a good chance I'm talking out of my ass.

Sideline warning on GeorgiaAlabama sideline: *hold my beer*
Hopefully it's nothing serious. Passing out suddenly like that could be a sign of worse things, but hopefully he's just dehydrated.
These guys goin crazy for punts.

Yeah. No explanation other than they have iced towels on him.
DB collapsed on sideline for unknown reason.

Kid apparently just collapsed all of a sudden. Seems like the type of thing you hear when there is some serious underlying heart issues. Really hope that's not the case and he just has just some blood pressure or sugar issue

Man, this bitch loves some ribs
Just makes me think how good Oklahomas offense is 
What did I miss?!
No refs keep the frontrunner up like the B1G refs. Or at least keeps from being a blowout in this case. Gotta keep all the eyes for the commercial$$$$.
Joke's on you guys, Chubb has been pulling the long con. Ya boy's about to come off the chain for exactly 4.5 yards per play for the next 12 minutes to seal the game. 
weird to point this out in a game like this, but the punting on both sides has been excellent
For once please show the lights. Krypton is one of the coolest traditions we have.

YES I FUCKING KNOW!!Been keeping my eye on him for the past 2 months or so and realized this dude just BALLS OUT like a true all american 1st round pick man.His ability to tackle one on one agaisnt elite athletes who are bigger/faster etc, his close out speed, his instincts, his nose for the football... this guy is special. 
He goes for big hits a bit too much and he didn't look great in coverage vs Oklahoma. Crazy good instincts though, he'll definitely be a 1st rounder.
Mods are drunk 
Stop saying last 
Does anyone actually eat ribs from fast food/chain places?

How is that Bama player that went after a coach on the sideline not sent to the locker room.

Yeah he did, EMS is tending to him
Are you watching? Seeing your guys punching/pushing/getting away with shit? Oh I get it, you don't wanna recognize it
It''s mainly for the fourth. It''s I think to get focused and finish out the game 
Sideline has been more interesting than the field this half.
Did that guy take any knocks?
Why is it not closed yet?
*just bama things*
looks like it
Dying
Lived in Athens for 5 years. There is playing tough, and acting like hoodlum. 
I think it's pretty disrespectful to play this game on the anniversary of the 307 A.D. poisoning and ursurping of Jin Huidi, Chinese emperor of the Jin Dynasty by the evil Jin Huaidi
SABAN HAS LOST CONTROL OF HIS FOOTBALL TEAM. TO RETIRE AFTER GAME (MAYBE EVEN BEFORE) AN SOURCE CONFIRMS THAT LANE KIFFIN HAS AGREED TO RETURN TO THE FRESHWATER
Games like this have me forever convinced that the central time zone is the best one for watching sports.
I''ve spent the whole game commenting. I think I''m just going to watch and enjoy the 4th.
Has anyone mentioned that both QBs in the game are freshmen?

I don't think running a freshman second string quarterback the entire second half is dramatic at all

I skipped Floribama Shore just to watch another reality show
I think Saban used his dark magic to punish the player who collapsed for spreading rat poison.
This game is chock full o' drama..
There's money to be made!
It''s typically only done for the 4th quarter.
McDonald on the stretcher is conscious,

They have to remind themselves and others due to CTE.
It''s a very common thing to put a 4 up at the start of the 4th. Most high school and college teams do this.

He's on Saban's sacrificial obsidian table.
Getting pissed off at an opposing player who is also in full pads and helmet after a play is...understandable.Doing that to a coach of the team you are actively playing on is...I don''t think idiotic is strong enough. Lacking all mental capacities?
I hope he didn't faint and hit his head or some shit

I''d really like to see a bench clearing one lol
Exactly my thought. It should never get to that if you're paying attention and realize you have heat exhaustion. Though he's playing in the National Championship game, he's not gonna leave because he's hot. Sure hope they cool him down quickly.

Agreed. Saban is never humble when defeated and always acts like a little girl when he loses. Can't even recall how many tantrums I've seen him throw this past year. Too many to count.
They''re using B1G refs.
Tua has a cannon.
Dafuq? Refs pushed Bama through. There were several non-calls on holdings throughout that drive. 
What side had a player swing on a coach?
"The entire Georgia team is ejected from the game. Bama is awarded the national championship."
Yup
This so hard.

He should have been tossed after he shoved Fromm in the back of the head after the play.  The coach was just icing on the cake that should have finished him off.

From what they were describing and how he looked he looked like he just passed out. Worst case would be cardiac but considering how quick he came to and that they wanted to ice him and cool him down that seems doubtful.
So Bama guy can punch a UGA players and not get ejected, yet Snell gets ejected for saying he's good?

THE LAST QUARTER OF THE SEASON BOYSITS BEEN AN HONOUR 
Still salty about that offside and face mask 
TEAM METEEEEEEEOOORRRRR
Fuck the refs, Fuck bama
Hi
First 
Game is so intense players are passing out on the sideline. 
Like 13th
GO (OTHER) DAWGS!
The long dark offseason is almost upon us.
15 minutes to doom
Good job mods getting this out before we need to riot 
I didn''t see, what happened?
I might just puke. Hunker it down one more time!
Come on Bama do not fail me the one time I cheer for you
Still have PTSD from the Super Bowl
Does anyone have video of the Bama player going down?
Reminder: the officiating has been absolute shit in this game.
Nick Saban has lost control of Alabama
I'm just here to root for the Crimson Tears.
ESPN froze: what happened to that McDonald dude?
Come on boys! This is what you came back for!
Georgia's going to march right down the field with a couple of third-and-long conversions, aren't they?
This game is great lmao 
LETS FUCKING GO
Got a game on our hands. Sloppy, hard hitting, beautiful football 
I don't like these depressing commercials
One quarter from America winning and Alabama losing!
even if UGA ends up winning, i'm happy to see signs of life from the offense.
if UGA wins tonight, we will be following a championship trend:1981: Clemson --> 2016: Clemson1980: UGA --> 2017: UGA1979: Bama --> 2018: Bama
LETS GET IT ON!!!!!
Can I get an Alabama sideline TV show? Please and thanks.
you mean 67th
Let's finish this thing!
Bama pls pls do the thing don't let Georgia win plsEdit: bring on the downvotes bandwagonners also succ me
What a weird fucking game.
I HOPE EVERYONE IS AS DRUNK AS I AM
Please pull this off Dawgs 
Bama''s players are acting like little bitches. 
I'm expecting the entire UCF team to run out of the tunnel with bats and folding chairs to start an NCG royal rumble any second now
I want all I can eat chicken tenders 
Brethren on watch ESPN who are pissed at this stream - switch over to the sounds of the game stream it''s much better
What an idiot
Man I hope that kid who collapsed for bama is ok
The events in the third quarter composed the wackyest quarter of football I've ever seen. 
And here we go. Hopefully this doesnt end with Saban selling any more of his players souls to win the game.
Let''s go dawgs
Really hope that the DB who collapsed is okay. 
This has been a lot more exciting than I expected.
Seriously Fuck Bama and their dirty ass players
HOT TAKE: GEORGIA WINS
Buckle your seatbelts. Here we go!
If bama wins I''m buying everyone Hawaiian pizza
It seems like Hurts throwing left handed isn''t working much better than him throwing right handed
No one knows, he just collapsed
This has been the longest game of my life 
we've got a lot of work to do. 
Here comes the Bama Defensive TD to get the 4th quarter nice and hectic!
Me too but it doesn''t hurt 
All of Applebee''s financial woes and they decide licensing a Celine Dion song for a riblet commercial is a good investment 
dear god, Alabama DB or something collapsed on the sideline, not good.
Let's do this Georgia!
Whooooooooooooooooooo!  Here we go!
fourth quarter woohoo
Just collapsed 
SEC? SEC? SEC?
UNLIMITED RIBLETS
Hi my dudes
Last quarter for 9 months. Make it count. 
He appears to be breathing okay. So that's good :-)
Can''t believe the refs didn''t see the Bama guy slam down Fromm''s head
Heavy commercial State Farm
HELLO FROM THE THIRD QUARTER THREAD!!!!!!!
200 comments already lol
Entering this last quarter it has been an absolute pleasure with y''all this season
he collapsed randomly.
Alabama''s offense is embarrassing 
Flair up brudda
First
Let's pour one out for everyone still in the second quarter thread
I do not like the Alabama football team. Not at all.
Damn state farm. Why you gotta hit me with the feels right now?
It feels like there is more extra curricular drama than on field excitement
15 more minutes bitches!
Should've been tossed the first time and Saban should send him to the locker room for what he did on the sideline
Nobody knows. 
Please, Georgia. Please. Just don't let the evil empire win. 
Two things get me off in this world. That Applebee''s riblets commercial, and a Crimson Tide LEdit: riblets 
Let''s see how dirty and hateful bama can get here.
Comments coming so fast no one will see I'm an Ohio State fan.
Well I'm not ready for football to be over
Who likes microwaved food? APPLEBEESSS
Collapsed
Bulldogs stronger together! 
Had a farm
I hope Kyriq is ok.
Applebee''s making food sexual
So... who thinks Bama is gonna win?I'm rooting for UGA and prepared to have my heart broken
How's the upstart team from Georgia gonna blow this one?
#F O U R #O  #U#R
DO IT GEORGIA
Couldn''t agree more! 
I'm just here to root for the Crimson Tears.
I predict an SEC victory.
R E F B A L L PART 4: EVERYBODY WALK THE BAMASAUR
Did that kid get knocked out by his own teammate?
You are the real mvp 
Watching Fullmetal Alchemist between all these bullshit commercials. 
Damn, what a commercial
if only, my sweet summer child
4D Chinese Checkers y''all
WatchESPN fucking sucks.
Same
#LETS GO DAWGS, HOLD
The refs are bitches, let's go dawgs! 
[deleted]
Damn that was a great commercial
Nick Saban needs to bench Tua and put in Lil Sweet
[Redcoat Band - Fourth Quarter - Krypton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiSDiMUUtFg)
15 minutes till later entire of season of salty Bama fans. GO DAWGS!
UGA needs one more TD!
[deleted]
He was sitting up and looked to be conscious. Good sign. Maybe he just fainted. 
Oh, they saw.
32 minutes of commercials so far
He''s conscious so that''s good 
Man, that's so sad to see. I hope he's alright.
Remember Guy Le Douche?
IT ALL COMES DOWN TO THIS
WOOOOOOOO LAST QUARTER OF THE SEASON 
Glad he seems only. 
They did. They just don''t care. 
One quarter from America winning and Alabama losing!
WTF happened on the sideline. First #48 going wild trying to fight the world, now a poor kid passing out 
refs are trash
Alright boys, calm the fuck down. Let's focus and get back in this thing.
207 comments....FIRST
I still can't believe Saban pulled Hurts, unless he's injured or something.
Did he have a stroke or what?
[deleted]
When they said ice towels. Heat casualty
Upvote the thread, mofos!
we saw someone collapsed and they put icepacks with him supposedly so probably heat stroke
I'm just as interested in what's happening on the sidelines as i am the gameHow gaping is #48's asshole now? What just happened with the bama player falling on the ground? I need to know these answers
This is madness
WE IN HERE Hope McDonald is okay. 
He collapsed on the sidelines for no apparent reason he's getting carted out right now, awake and conscious
Thank God he's conscious
The officiating will be the sole reason Alabama will win this. Such garbage is inexcusable. 
Lmao
Im fucking toasted 
I wonder if 48 ended up causing the issue with the kid that's down on the sideline.That backup lb wanted to hurt someone...
4444444
What is going on?!
Might make for a better game.
First!....wait
They saw it, they just didn''t care
Wooo he''s awake
I'm fading. I don't think I can make it to the end.
[deleted]
20000th to last
Oh they saw it.  They just don't seem to care.
What's up?
He collapsed but not sure why
Glad to see he''s conscious
Kyriq feel better 
That freckly dude in the Apple commercial (meet me in the club) is also in the Tax Act ad serving ice cream out of a food truck. 
I thought it was RebaI haaate Reba
That's means more beers
No u
Yo Dawgs,Please dont pull a Falcons here and blow a double digit lead to the most hated team in your sport.
Kid looks out of it
My body is ready 
An Alabama freshman collapsed mysteriously, he''s awake now as far as I can see and he has been responsive.
I really don't want the college football season to end :(
He probably just locked his knees and passed out.
Forgive me for not being well versed in dirty playing in football...anyone else think that bama's players are acting like dicks?
upvote or next years playoff will be 4 SEC teams
Shit... he just fell? Oh man. Hope it was just exhaustion 
They''re rattled for the first time in a long time 
The last quarter of the season. It was a pleasure!
Did he say "Get that camera out of his face" lmao
Are those flashlights?
4
I'll allow it
Glad he's awake. Hope he gets better.
Damn Applebees commercial made me want to go to Barry Dyngles
Glad to see that young man awake 
One more quarter Dawgs! 
Don't forget that the Atlanta Falcons brand new stadium has a robotic butthole roof that is leaking months after being completed.
We need some points in this last quarter..
That Alabama DB''s collapse is symbolic of their whole team
Why do you think that player collapsed
B1G if true
What y'all think of Kevin Sumlin at Arizona?
Lets gooooo
"SOMEBODY HIT SOMEBODY"- Saban 
I fucking love college football 
Late af wtf mods.
Alright /r/cfb, 4th quarter. We're 17k comments down, but I know we can rally, and get ahead.
If the 4th lives up to the 3rd we're in for one helluva ride.
250 comments in a minute lol 
That statefarm commercial always makes me feel sad / bad for not helping out more
A D S A D S #ADS ADS ADS!
We need to hire back Kiffen and Smart asap.
I wish I was in Athens tonight hly fuck I love taht place I can't imagine tonight omg. 
I think this will be a nail biter
alcoholic and I like college football
and for the final act of this circus, Bear Bryant comes out of the ground at Mercedes Benz stadium and kills Nick Saban, only to coach the rest of the game and Bama comes back and wins so that he can be better than Saban
LET'S GEAUX DAWGS!
LASToh wait nm
I just want to say that anytime the referee speaks, I can feel the disappointment he has for me. 
Yeah holy shit, what happened??
I think he just collapsed unconscious on his sideline. 
That commercial makes me want to be homeless.
Did McDonald get punched by #48? (I joke because he seems to be fine)
A L L I T E R A T I O N   S Z N
Big if true
When does the winner of this game play UCF in the natty? 
LET'S GO FINAL QUARTER
Put it away Dawgs.
Yes
Freshman player just collapsed on the sideline as far as I could see. He looked awake but no idea how significant that is 
This game is wild.
go dawgs!!
Well after that 3rd quarter I can't wait to see what the writers have in store for the finale.
There is a lot going on on that Alabama sideline
Long 15 minutes here.
They saw it. Just too scared to throw a flag like that in the championship game I'd imagine. 
I think he said he prefers the prequels
Has to be heat stroke then. I've passed out from it before and it's bad shit.
deleted  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.8533  [^^^What ^^^is ^^^this?](https://pastebin.com/FcrFs94k/57770)
Good to see he appears alright.
Hope he''s doing okay, that''s some scary stuff
He looked barely conscious.
Hit me baby one more time. - nick saben remix
BY GAWD THATS SCOTT FROST
SEC bias smdh
The "Don't let Alabama win" quarter begins!
They didn''t really let us do Krypton the jerks
Dehydration is my guess. 
Wanna give a shout out to Tony Brown holding back his asshole-ness and being the only Bama player to not get involved in a fist fight so far.
Do people actually want a flag for that
what is  this? 1999? 
Thank goodness that guy is okay.
Ugh, now new Bama's just gonna be in our division.
Benched your starting QB. Player swinging at a coach on national tv. Now a player collapses on the sideline. The fall of Bama 30 for 30 is gonna be good.I hope the kid is okay. 
Jesus Christ are they sure he's awake he looked really out of it
Has Nick Saban lost control of the program?^/s 
Same :(
This game is either going to end calmly with a Georgia win or Bama is going to have a really controversial call on a game-winning drive. 
Saban sacrificing players on the sideline.
I''m on mobile but I go to Wofford so it doesn''t really mean anything I''m just enjoying the game cause it''s entertaining 
Sounds like he''s gonna be okay, thank god
Dehydration?
tough run
300th
Collapsed on sideline. Being evaluated. Freshman defensive back. No one knows why.
That was scary as shit
Nice he's good
Can''t believe the ref didn''t see Georgia''s lb punch a wide receiver in the first quarter either Edit: i love being an Alabama fan on /r/cfb
That's way less than I thought.
Please don't freeze my phone like that last thread on live again CFB pls lol
I can''t believe these refs man. Go Dawgs
UCF should be here. 
So Bama is playing dirty and the refs are allowing it.
Dude...
For what?
Anyone find #48s social media to see if he's bitching out his coaches from the locker room
NO NOT THE CELINE DION APPLEBEES COMMERCIAL I HAVE PTSD FROM LAST WEEK
Dawgs need to bury these guys here 
SHIRTLESS FOURTH 
I only have one beer left :(
Getting benched in the NCG has gotta be a real kick in the dick
UCF ready for that 5th quarter action 
Shit that commercial got me feeling some type of way 
Kids conscious. Back to football.
Tonight, we are all true freshman.
Alabama turning the game into street rules
Michel has run himself into the first round these last 2 games.
Yes, do that for the rest of the game
Um he doesn't look good though 
Roll Dawgs, Roll.
That was ridiculous you gotta call that
Those guys should definitely wipe their asses more
I predict georgia to win but Henry to get the snitch 
Nice run
What makes you think they didn't? 
I lit my phone in Trappeze
Probably just exhausted, or dehydrated.
Good on the guy saying to get the camera outta there
Rebellions are built on hope Georgia.
 C'mon boring 4th. I got skyrim to play. 
ESPN showing an amateur athlete's medical emergency on live TV. Wow...
Hi
Sony Michel needs all the carries from here on out.
Still too soon. 
Probs overheated/dehyrdrated
If you are involved in this thread, upvote this thread. CFB represent. 
Can we get a camera on the Bama sideline for the rest of the game, please?
Georgia is growing RBs in a factory
General consensus on Applebees? 
Might not be necessary. When it's Alabama everyone hates you. 
Hopefully the kid is okay.  There are a lot of pretty minor reasons that someone could faint in this situation, so hopefully it is just one of those.
Chubb who?
Refs 10Dawgs 20
Can''t see us getting back in this, missed field goal is gonna cost lots
15 minutes can save you 15% or more on car insurance tho
YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAS
Don''t you.....Forget about me
Poor kid, hope he is okay, really scary
Dickhead sideline guy acting as the camera police.
Georgia just needs to keep feeding Sony Michel. Don't repeat the Falcons' mistakes.
Grind that clock down
Michel is a goddamn truck
Hopefully he just locked his knees or something. 
I'm not crying, you're crying
And mine
I'm still not over the Bama player who swung on his coaches. What the hell, man
Freshman backup do a bit too much drinking last night?
https://imgur.com/LdxcXJN this guy fucking called it
Glad to see hes awake.
Fuck a 8oclock boi time to enjoy this Crimson hide tannin
RIP fellas.
Good on you. I will admit I bet on you guys and cheered with my horns hat on in public last week lol
Not if Georgia scores on this drive.
This just in... Sony Michel is good at football
Georgia, I highly reccomend running the ball to wind down that clock. The clock is not you're friend
I don''t think Fromm has played that well, but he''s made the throws when they''ve mattered most, and that''s what it takes to win a national championship 
Some things are bigger than football. Hope he''s ok.
Underrated comment
He's awake, loaded him into the medical cart.
Good news the kid is responsive
first Kappa
dawgs please
great run Sony
Going out on a limb here but 48 May have orchestrated Benghazi. 
Not sure, he just collapsed.
1 Quarter left in the season.  Let us all take a chance to remember the good times.  And remember to pay tribute while you still can to the freshly crowned national champion UCF Knights.
So, Georgia vs UCF next Monday? 
Hope that kid is alright. Very weird to just collapse like that 
slow down either with typing or drinking
yah but chick fil a...
Now comes the Georgia run show!  Saved it for the end.
Who''s got a vid of bama #48 fighting the coach?
Do you think that other Alabama player punched him and knocked him out? Seemed to be swinging. At everybody. 
Big drive here. Eat some time and hold onto the ball
Switch to the Spanish stream. It works. 
Shitposts are coming...
That's such a Georgia team thing to do though
Ohhhhhh understandable
Why would i go to Applebees? I have a perfectly good microwave at home
 Pro tip: if you really want to help homeless person by driving or walking by them, give them food. Don''t give them money or else they''ll  go use it on drugsEdit: smart phone typo
Man I'm thinking about McDonald, hope he gets well.  
That sounds very bizarre 
finally Fourth Quarter.
15 minutes of playing time until the shitposting starts!
Amen to that. These commercials are Crystal clear HD though....
McDonald probably collapsed due to all the drama happening
Is it also the reason theyre down ten?
Use at least 30 seconds off the playclock each time. No need to go fast
Fuck Bama and glad the guy seems okay
Georgia's main priority is to avoid fumbling. 
What happened? Was he overheated?
Michel ready to put the team on his back this quarter 
Lets Gooooooooooo Dawgs!
Close it out with some good solid runs
Jalen Hurts to Lane Kiffin: U Up?
Sony Michel has a future in Playstation commercials!
This game has everything. I need a bigger beer.
So what happened to the player that collapsed?
solid run Sony
Big if true.
I got GA +4, so sure. 
[Hurts to Michigan.   /s](https://i.imgur.com/vUIUibv.jpg)
I love Chubb, but I feel bad. I think this game hurts his draft stock.
Yeah that's assault 
can't be too safe
We need to Rally
[deleted]
remember to drink water dudes
Michel at least has figured out that when in doubt, cut upfield
Me too thanks
Uncool, dude.
BIG DAWGS GOTTA EAT!
Michel > Chubb
He fainted? First time ever having to play real football? First time ever losing?
It''s Bama
im here and it tua 
[deleted]
Everyone surrounding him like that doesn''t help, let medical staff do their thing
\#godawgs
His eyes are open, but he looks like he's not all there
Following
Yeah I had it once. Almost passed out, it was not fun. Hope he's okay.
48 punched him
Clocked by 48 is my guess
Outplayed Bama and the refs!
I''d like to officially be the first person to sarcastically claim that I am the first person to comment on this post.
Over 18,000 comments in the 3rd. Let's see what kind of damage we can do in the 4th.
I hope 26 is ok.
Inb4 Calvin Ridley 34 yard game winning TD
The homeless shelter commercial needs Judd Nelson to make it complete.
Bye bye scholarship
thats a funny way of saying runescape 
I missed that fight or whatever that broke out and only caught the end of it. Was he fighting with a coach? I saw that then he stormed away. 
It''s Noon in Beijing, how y''all doing?
GO DAWGS
Same
I second this
Tonight and tomorrow on r/CFB
Just score UGA. JUST SCORE. 
[Title game as of right now](http://a.fod4.com/misc/Attack%20Dog%20Round%20Corner.gif)Them Dawgs is hell.
Bama isn't out of this but their heads aren't right at the moment.
keep eating those yards up Sony
Gee, can't wait to see some more unbiased referees that certainly aren't helping Bama disproportionately!
Refs trying to keep this one close lol
That was outrageous. He was standing RIGHT THERE
Nope, seen
I really hope not
Dude probably didnt eat and just passed out due to low blood sugar, and as he's being stretchered out is thinking "I cant believe this is happning to me in the CFBNCG in front of millions of people."
ANYONE BUT BAMA!!
Im drunk
Georgia you seriously gonna run the ball each play?
Props to the coach telling off the camera guy for filming the guy that fainted
I''m going to miss you all once this game is over!!  Hopefully we have a fine crop of shitposts this offseason. 
Yep, no 48 on the field. He ded.
I've noticed commercials are using old hit songs a lot lately. Get a song stuck in your head and you're always thinking about that commercial. That Arby's commercial drove me nuts.
Didn't think I'd see a bama meltdown like this under Saban I LOVE ITedit: kill me
SOMEONE BE A HERO
Dilly dilly 
Hope this quarter isn't an hour long like the third.
Dawgs are still in this. We might be able to come back from being up 10 pts in the fourth.
Saban retiring?-La Confera probably 
Besides the phantom offsides on blocked punt, I don''t see a problem with the refs
Why did we have to get vengeful Bama instead of this lazy, bitchy Bama team?
DILLY DILLY
Is there a postgame fight lined up on the Bama sideline
Play me out with that sweet titanic music.
When UCF makes it to a national championship game.
Jimbo may lead you to the promise Land. He may also belittle your investment. Really it's a 50/50 shot tbh
48 punched him
Heavy dose of GA running backs and that''s a wrap...
Chop that wood!!
papa bless Michel
Buckle up.  It could be a wild ride.
Hello
If Tua started this game would be a totally different story.
I really love how Basket Case by Green Day is becoming a go-to song to play by marching bands
He is awake now
Hot take 
I like them, they're worthy causes. Volunteering and donating is good 
He did just collapse.. 
I just wanna know if the coaches got punched.
EAT EAT EAT
Was the dude who passed out playing a lot this game or was he a back up that just collapsed?
I''ve spent the whole game commenting. I think I''m just going to sit back and enjoy the 4th.
LAST?
I hate to say it but Chubb shouldn't get the ball again until they just wanna eat clock 
one of those soap opera type faints lol
Saban took his life force 
Run da bawl!
Seizure? Heart arrhythmia? 
Man, good thoughts and prayers for McDonald. That's a scary thing.
Hope it's just that.
More info on the sideline fight please.
Seriously tho, is there any conference that has good refs? 
So wrap this one up for Georgia, start the debate on if UCF is the actual national champ?
Asking the real questions
Yo
You're a saint!
15 minutes left in the season. time to pull out all the stops.
hello thread, one last ride...
Third tackle to get 'em.
Both these teams have seen some shit... and shit accessories.  This 4th will be wild.
But it's cold as shit in Atlanta rn
I''m excited for all the “I hate sportsball” comments in the postgame thread when it hits r/all
Michel has been by far Georgia's best back tonight. Just feed him already!
Going after the coach?
Was that Alabama assistant complaining about cameras on the sideline?
Maybe someone spiked the Gatorade.
Bama player seems decent now. He''s alert, at least.
Hope he's okay
I honestly can't believe that Saban couldn't put together a better Half time adjustment. 
Dear Million Dollar Marching Band:When the ref sets the ball, please follow the rules and shut the fuck up. 
Alabama has been hilarious
https://mobile.twitter.com/Deadspin/status/950578313302601728/photo/1
rip in piece
Ok. 
Is it really a rebellion from Georgia,though?Or,just another,imperialistic dynasty taking over?
A guy we forgot to invite to the bar to watch this showed up with his friend and hasn''t noticed our group here yet. He''s alright and we feel bad. Do we invite him over or pretend like we never saw him?
Who would win 22 elephants or one frosty boi
BAM!https://twitter.com/Sports_Burd/status/950578597932294146
Can I give them drugs?
is he your dad? WOO
Is the Bama band playing "Last Resort" by Papa Roach?
It says a lot that the announcers aren't even talking about Chubb practically not playing 
Oh fuck yeah that''s hot 
wild game man
Remember to upvote the thread my dudes, we gotta get to r/all
Props to the guy giving the cameraman shot for filming the kid on the gurney. Hope he''s okay
wow 17000 + comments in the third quarter alone. Epic.
If Bama don't score at least 10 more points they won't have a chance to win this game
If I had a dollar for every time Nick Saban lost back to back titles, I would be ecstatic in an hour
Was he just dehydrated? Standing on the sidelines with his legs locked for a long time or some shit?
Not factoring in overtime, of course …
Not as embarassing as kissing your sister
No droppy the ball dawgs
 I always forget how fast the season goes by... Now I''m sad.
hey camera guy, listen to the nice staffer and GTFO from the medical cart
Fucking squib kick bruh =(
absolutely. poor sports
Here's a gif of the altercation.Appears that he actually hit the coach with his helmet. https://twitter.com/Claudio_GSN/status/950578249888882688
Thank God dude is awake
You're late
Good game UGA. I had fun this season on this sub. See y'all next year!
*WASTED*
it's almost unwatchable
It is
Michel looked like Zeke on that first down run. Awesome. 
All right let''s do this. 
Lol please do
Not funny
Anyone have a gif of the punch on Fromm's head?
https://twitter.com/Sports_Burd/status/950578597932294146
B1G if true!
Big if true
The rose bowl was better than this. 
That Bama player is how all Bama fans feel right now
thank god
I feel like everyone is leading with their heads this entire game
Here 'till the bitter end.
Why are you taking homeless peoples' money to buy drugs?
Feed Sony
And don''t lock your knees.
Probably drained
He's already looking for schools to transfer to
Still there from what they just showed
Plz god 
If my life is so crappy I'm homeless, give me drugs man, give me lots of drugs. 
Guys what's going on I just saw alabama's quarterback hand the ball of to the runningback. Is this some sort of new offense they came up with? I thought that they only use running backs as blockers. Nick Saban is a master mind of adjustments.
1 more quarter till a long time without college football :(
May Georgia beat Bama by more points than Bama beat y'all. 
I get pretty jealous of people on the west coast during games like these.
Hope that kid is okay :o
I dont have any announcers on my stream is dude going to be alright?
that's good he was somewhat responsive hopefully he'll feel better soon. 
I can't imagine he was dehydrated, maybe nerves? 
Low blood sugar maybe? 
lets goooo
TO THE PIT OF MISERY DILLY DILLY 
Hey, i hate bama to the point that I actively realize it is unhealthy, but they earned that fg
The last quarter of Chubb, Michel, Sanders, Roquan, and so many more...I am so happy but also sad
Anyone have a link to that bama player freaking out? I missed it 
I wonder what percentage of people on here think it is UCF''s title.
Here come the Dawgs
This thread should be a pure shit show.
https://twitter.com/barstooltweetss/status/950578372060565504
Michel is a beast
Michel is making himself money 
CHOP CHOP CHOP CHOP 
You mean about an hour, because I haven't been peddled enough cars, insurance for the car, and fast food places to drive to using my newly bought/insured car.
Bama player appears to be okay. You may now resume your FUCK YOU BAMA chants.
FINISH HIM
I think Michel is going to be the better NFL back. Better quickness than Chubb.
Did the Alabama DB collapse because he got assaulted by 84?
Being reminded of when Roquan Smith flipped to Georgia on NSD... feels bad man
The Michigan Detroit Lions?
You probs right
the run game is wearing them down   ooooh shit
Imma miss all of you 
I can only hope, that the winning coach at the end of the game, during the interview, gets cold water poured on em and they pull a Carmelo Anthony.
Sony Michel is channeling his inner Nick Chubb
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cuQXe1w4Ac4
Thanks Harvard
Big if true
Sony Michel is a name made for the PlayStation Fiesta Bowl
[When you're looking for the 4TH Quarter thread](http://img2.thejournal.ie/inline/2434312/original/?width=426&version=2434312)
Michel should just keep running the rest of this game 
Did a guy die on the sidelines?
Doubt it, but that would be quite the sideline controversy
These RBs gotta be making Gurley proud.
Dawgs are dominating the line right now
https://twitter.com/CFBgifer/status/950578476657987584
Hot take
Thanks madden
We need a video of him trying to go at his coach
Sweeeeeeeet caraline
Sony Michel seems to never lose yards ever. 
Sony Michel > Nick Chubb ????
UGA is gonna win this. 
Bama being gutted. Just hold onto that ball boy 
Keep your foot on the gas!

Hot take of the game right here folks
Waiting for Bama to go full trash and fingerbang some assholes between plays.Looking at you Clemson.
2 more runs then a bomb
Sony Michel taking this game over
Patterson would just beat him out (easily)
#Penis
They are acting like pouty children. 
If you''re using the WatchESPN app, use the command center stream! It''s mostly commercial free and has had very minor lag.
This dude is dumping all over Bama 
Break their will!!!
cant believe a bama team has shown up looking this poor
What an idiot. 
they'll probably win by one but at least we can enjoy them being down
Just don't let it happen
Just hold on to that ball, Sony
Thank God they're running the ball.
Do we know what happened to that injured player?
RUNTHEBALL
I know this guy is good but jesus that's all they do is run the ball
Why is there a new thread for every quarter this is the first time I go on r/cfb but it looks cool and looks like there''s a lot of karma here. Also fuck Bama.
4th QUARTER BEAT BAMA!!!!
Wait, what?
Y'all should be here
So far it's only two. But that's enough for me to want Georgia to take this.
https://i.imgur.com/7exPXju.jpgClose up on the 80 yard UGA TD cleat on sideline
Ball game if Bama''s d is this gassed 
Need a long drive with tough running and a TD and thatll likely end it
That dude knew how to beat the rush out of the stadium
KEEP CHOPPIN THIS IS WHAT WERE ABOUT. 
I've been watching the no-announcers feed on WatchESPN, and it's a much better experience.
These running backs are men from Georgia
keep eating those yards up Sony, let's go DAWGS!
For the flair
Right out of the guardians of the galaxy playbook
WE NEED BIG D'S NOW
Sony has added some zeroes to his paycheck these last 2 games
sony michel is unreal with the quickness
Nice run to start the fourth.  More of that and control the game.
Ah the what Kyle Shanahan should have done method.
I''m just here to watch Bama fans implode :)
Some nice running by Georgia right now 
He didn't look like he knew where he was.
[deleted]
These UGA backs are just crazy. 
Once Saban sees that footage I doubt he'll be wearing a Bama uniform again. 
C'mon now HIPAA doesn't exist for athletes. /s
announcers never want to admit anyone can be tougher than bama
Michel just wants it more than everyone on the field, it's scary
When you can run the ball like that at this point in the game, Georgia will be in good shape 
Tanking
Next season I predict we will need to split quarter threads into 8ths
That ridiculous 3rd quarter almost made up for the snoozefest that was the first half 
Georgia's backfield - A song of Ice and Fire
Starting the 4th before 11:30, color me surprised 
Come on Georgia don't go Falcons on us.
Bama's tired and Georgia's backs are fresh. 
Damn Bama is all over the place rn
Everything is bigger in Texas.
Sometimes you just want to play with your Sony instead of your Chubb.
Bama fans enjoy pineapple on pizza
Time to see how tired this Bama defence is. 
So nice to see someone beat Alabama at it's own play style
Keep wearing them down. Go Dawgs!
This Georgia RB tandem is badass
oh lol that's bad but so, so funny
15 more minutes of CFB. Then the offseason. I'm excited for some shit posts. 
Really want Michel to bust a 60-yarder. Don't see it happening but that's all this game is missing
48 was banished to the pit of misery
Michel is a BEAST
Local PD might have what youre looking for
If I know one thing about drafting running backs, it's that position rarely indicates success outside of the top five.
Not until UCF drops to FCS in about 20 years and the SEC is allowed to schedule them
What''s this about a coach getting bitch slapped?
Who gonna cawl Pawwwlll tomorrow?
GOOD THING THIS WAS THE PRACTICE GAME, RIGHT?
Two better teams.
But it's just state farm trying to sell you insurance, not volunteer opportunities
For what it's worth, the bands have been good during this game: clear, quick, and not too annoyingly repetitive. 
Keep running it!!
TU. Love it
Being a neutral Bama fan feels like being a neutral Putin fan
Anyone got the video of number 48? 
Dude fainted...Jesus Christ espn, easy with the hyperbole 
At least it's not pac12 aFtER dArK refs
game plan to tire out the Bama D is working 
Run it down their throat
And here is where running 60+ plays takes its toll. Good night Bama.
> I''ll go use it on drugsI see you're one of the Oregon fans who really lives in Springfield
I've never been anti-Bama, but they're showing themselves to be an unlikable team. I hope Georgia finishes this off. 
I'm convinced that Sony Michel is a better back than Chubb
Sony Michel wants to eat. And he will wash his food down with Bama 48's tears.
Just a reminder about the land that is on the line for this game
Georgia is gonna fumble.
Which team had the dud collapse?
We're running out of steam. Big runs to come.
Bama is the best runner-up team in the country. No doubt about it lol. Can't wait to lose the natty for the third time in a row next year. 
I am going to spread the word that Saban killed that guy until he''s proven alive.
Can't wait to so more Alabam temper tantrums
Man, if he had cut left instead of right...daylight!
Cant win the game if our defense can't get off the field. This is what killed us last year. 
keep churning those yards up baby, let's go!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Georgia-Oklahoma was the Championship Game we all deserved.
Sony Michel is so good. He's straight up explosion.
Now we get to see reddits resident doctors offer their expert medical opinion
Does anyone else see kids in the crowd and get a little annoyed at their own parents even though they grew up way too comfortably as it is?
This is the part where some miraculously lucky plays and obviously biased calls get made to win Bama the game 
come on def
Announcers said he is conscious and able to respond to trainer prompts
Duh
Lane Kiffin *cough*
What happened to #48 is he still on the sideline after the meltdown
Such a gritty runner. I love it
Played against Christian Miller in high school. Amazing the change in his body. Never knew he would become what he is today 
Just leave Micheal in UGA 
I might go so far as to say they can't win unless they score at least 11
Most def. 
Dehydration or locking knees maybe. Hope he''s good. 
You have a bright career as an announcer. You have what it takes!
rose bowl was epic this year .. 
Probably dehydration I'd imagine. 
30 for 30: It matters less; the Alabama saga
I want y'all to lose but don't give up yet bama bro
I wouldn''t say so, but the momentum gained from the false off-sides, missed face masks, personal fouls and other various penalties are, again, inexcusable.
I hope UGA just keeps smashing it up Alabama''s mouth for 10 yards every play 
Let''s go Dawgs, 13 mins
At the moment it's a rebellion.
6th round draft pick my ass
How much are "exhibitions" regulated? Would love to see a UCF vs winner exhibition game. 
Lol this sub is so ridiculously anti-Alabama, atleast r/nfl is tolerant of Patriots fans, this place is just anti-Alabama everywhere
WWENCAA
Hell in the Cell. Bring the cage down. Lay the tacks out!
Basket Case-Green Day. 
Over here in PST, living the time zone dream
Whats everyone drinking 
I prefer a game like this over a 54-48 game any day
Dilly dilly!
On one hand, Georgia's controlled this game pretty much from the jump and has a 2 score lead. On the other, it's Atlanta-area sports. Georgia fans must collectively be in the world's largest glass case of emotion right now lol
Bama not used to teams running right at them in the 4th quarter
i dont want suspense. kill them now dawgs
[YES!](https://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/7p48fo/game_thread_cfp_ncg_georgia_vs_alabama_8pm_et/dsegvc5/) /u/thewill450, you are the 3rd Quarter Game Thread Last Comment National Champion!
I'm late to the party. Why is Hurts out? Injury? Or not playing well?
Damn fam that stream really delayed, huh?
I know I was shitting on the megacast, but I''m a fan of if. Cutcliff and the Northwestern coach seem like the two smartest coaches in the room. Sumlin is very knowledgeable and you can totally tell he loves offense. 
How many total plays has Georgia ran on offense? Looks like it's starting to make an impact.
#rundabawl
Homers cast is same
My wife just told me the CFP logo looks like two bananas and now I can't unsee it.
Oline is digging deep here. I love this shit
Bama D gassed 
Gonna say a little prayer to the gods of yore, Herschel Walker and Vince Dooley 
Too soon? 
Running it down their throats right now. Damn. 
Know if there''s any video on twitter or something? I missed it bc I was shitposting.
Be careful what you wish for. The Empire will only be replaced by the First Order.
This man is going places
Dude you're down 10
Pro tip for those streaming the game: Spanish stream on the watchESPN app has no freezing or lag. ESPN is incompetent. 
*not a lot of running between the tackles*runs between the tackles
Alabama is getting tired 
Sonys vision is insane
CHUB CHUB CHUB!
I knew what this was before I clicked. 
SAME
Loose cannon.  Kick him off the team.
Here ya go lol https://twitter.com/colecubelic/status/950578057894617090
RIP in pepperoni, never forgetti 
>else i'll go use it on drugs are you a homeless person?
The Georgia boys upfront in the trenches brought their hard hats tonights. Those boys are PUSHING Bama's d line 4 or 5 yards every play. MAN I LOVE THIS SHIT
People competing to be the last post in all these threads. Not even I would stoop so low as a shitposting karma whore. 
I want off this ride
I'm guessing it's some combination of not drinking enough water, locking his knees, and maybe not eating before the game?
The Applebee''s commercial should have had Vince wilfork instead of that woman. 
This is where the Bulldog run game has to show itself.
48 on Alabama looking to get the tide a head start on the Fulmer cup
Chubb and Michel are the Ingram and Kamara of CFB
Is Tua still gonna transfer to UCLA?
Rose bowl, best bowl.
Mmmm yeah bby run that ball
Hef
Can someone tell me about the Alabama qb?I'm a lefty and it has been real depressing not being able to cheer on any lefty qbs in the nfl. Is this kid good and should I convert to Sabanism and buy a jersey?
Nah it'll be the combine thay does if he shows lack of quickness in drills. Michel looks better tonight though by far.
I'm hoping for a nice, long UGA TD drive. You know, the kind of thing Bama usually does to other teams.
i still feel bad for hurts
I missed it - who took a swing at a coach?
Hard nose running. 
Just watch the 2010 Liberty Bowl
You know it's bad when Chubb is actually getting good yardage.
This OL is working miracles against the D.
Bama getting tired
Man, Georgia is gashing this defense.
'Watchespn' so you can kinda sorta watch us talk about the game 30-45 seconds after the plays have happens and kinda experience it......but not really, we want you to buy cable.  
OU Secondary: Why doesn't Alabama sit back and watch the running backs after they break the first tackle?
Perfect QB for Harbaugh's system too.
Sounds of the game broadcast has been clutch 
LET'S GO 20K COMMENTS.
nobody will see this but I dutch oven myself under my bed sheets every time I fart at night
Sony. "Be Moved."
And here we go with Georgia
Michel's gonna be a good pro
I think it's a bad concussion for 48. He probably got his Bell rung and then caught up to him in the sideline. No signs of stroke or heart attack considering there was nothing hooked up to him by the EMTs
Just passing on what someone else posted. Night and day dude. 
me trying to watch the game and read this threadhttps://i.imgur.com/wCXw9zd.jpg
up the fucking gut yo
By drive 
Don't play not to lose. That will lose a game quicker than anything.
I was wondering the same thing. 
\#48 would have stopped him. Put em in coach!
Tf was he thinking?
Michel knows how to keep his legs churning, he''s fun to watch run 
Running game stronk 
Ya know, if Bama wants to win they need to stop the run up the middle. 
This game has been weird as fuck
Somehow despite last week, Alabama only prepared to stop Chubb
Each comment should have it's own thread.
Scandalous. 
Got to keep them fresh got to use the whole stable of running backs
All out moshpit scrap about to break loose on the Bama sideline
Sky Cam on ESPN 3 is dope
Tell us!!
We have two losing seasons in like the past forty years... How can one of them happen in the year fsu wins a natty, and the other happen in the year Georgia wins one? God... What have we done to you?
Run the Damn Bawl! 
This game is going to end in Malice in the Palace 2.
Michel is so damn underrated!
It's just not a good defensive matchup for him.
Cough syrup :(
eatin that clock up
UGA just chewing the clock playing ball control

Good luck. Buy him beer and be honest.
It didnt happen to you guys last year
Bama gunna lose and look like spoiled children doing it! 
I''ve never seen them lose composure. They look like a shit show 
PAC refs.
“Something something, we''re still the best”
I really hope he fainted due to locking his knees or something like that. Hope he's alright.
Sony Michel putting his feet up Bama's ass. 
Michel is a beast.
Run game serious
That cuts deep
You know the second Sony Michel declares for the draft he''s getting a FAT endorsement deal with PlayStation.
I don't think I have ever seen a Saban team straight up lose their cool before.And I love it
Bulldog run kills the game. Can't be giving up 5 yards a play and expect the opposition to throw.
Defense getting tired?
Bye Pruitt ... BYE
I know.  One day I'd like to get the first comment.  A useless but *wondrous* accomplishment
You must have been in marching band 
[deleted]
No coach loses more at the CFB playoffs then Nick Saban
Who cares about a trophy, a kid is getting carted off....
Number 48 on Georgia punched an opposing player then swung at his coach on the sideline
Coffee at this point.  Work in 5 hours.
FOR THE DAWGZZZZZZ 
I think he locked his legs and got over excited and fainted.  Same thing almost happened to me at my wedding. 
I was listening to the SiriusXM NFL station today and they were complaining about how NFL games are longer than 3 hours (even though the longest game this past weekend was under 3 hours 20 minutes). I think they'd die knowing college games last 4 hours, sometimes longer
What about that Bama defense that ESPN has been jerking off to all week?
That''s what I''d like to see 
When you feel entitled to win, you start to act like a spoiled brat.
Poured some vodka into my Arizona Arnold Palmer
Uh oh. Chubb got helped up by the ref. Better be careful not to draw a flag.
Bama D out of gas? Getting gouged in the middle.
Superbowl: far better commercials. CFB Championship: far better halftime performance.Advantage: none of us. 
michel to the Lions in the draft please
There's updog all over the field
Didn''t Auburn beat these teams
This would be much more representative of what I love about CFB than Kendrick Lamar, by a long shot.Bonus points if they stole the Miami chain and had it with them
No
played like shit. 
Fuck Harvard!
WE WANT UCF
Wow... That's uncalled for 
Heat exhaustion*, not stroke. Ninja Edit: Could be a few things, I don't think heat exhaustion is that likely. Number of things can occur with a person freshman age that would result in a temporary loss of consciousness. 
Yeah, and there will be twice as many commercials. 
I hope he's in the damn locker room.
theres our hc
Sony Michel should be co-MVP with 4
Shhhhh save the secret for the select few who know 
im waiting for that as well. Gold, Jerry, Gold!someone below posted this: https://twitter.com/Claudio_GSN/status/950578249888882688
Oh wow chubb did something.
Nick Chubb and Sony Michel sound like a boy-girl porn duo
This game is still on??? Holy shit 
Saban working on his dewlap exercises
Good God. That kids in some deep shit. I don't know if I've even seen someone behave that badly in a game. 
Bamas front like is tired. They can't stop the run. Georgia keeps this us and they are champs
The Bama defense is just too worn down.
By football scoring, Georgia is winningBy boxing scoring, Alabama is winning. They've landed all the punches
#PoundThatRock
This is over
But I no Habla espanol 
Anal leakage is nothing to joke about
Ineffective essentially
Don''t let Alabama being down by 10 distract you from the fact that the Falcons blew a 25 point lead. 
This is looking like how Kerryon looked in the 4th quarter against Bama.
Pound da rock
Sony Michel is the man.
My armchair medical degree guesses it might have been a seizure. He looked completely out of it. Looks just like I do after I have one.
That's why you've been running the ball all game, for this momentBama has no chance to stop them right now, too tired
BAMA player got an unsportsmanlike for swinging on a GA player and then kept it up on the sidelines 
Yea. It was. I even stopped everything to watch it. Grill included. ;/
If UGA wins there's really no argument.  If they want to even say anything they can say co champs.
He got pulled at the half.
Michel MVP this game
This guy called it.
no, but Saban did try to yell a guy to death
Offense was kinda stagnant aside from a couple plays with him in. 
 So scared Georgia''s gonna choke 
Locked his knees
UGA''s outside run game=cableUGA''s inside run game=directv 
Most teams GA can wear them out by the 4th quarter. AL has depth so not so much.
[deleted]
Bama D is tired... Dawgs running all 4th
Thanks BAMA, I lost 50 bucks I didn''t have because of you.
[Game Thread] CFP NCG: Alabama vs Whoever (8PM ET) Seventh Sixteenth
If they pull this off, everyone on the UGA sideline are about to slay tonight.
RIP everyone with a Sa6en 2018 tattoo
A battle in the trenches for sure
Crown
Not used to having to work this late in the game. 
They're not panicking so hopefully he just passed out. You usually feel pretty dazed after passing out.
The latter 
He was benched
Sony Michel is both lightning and thunder. Fucking love this man.    
Bama is getting tired
=D
I'm just here for good football.
I wonder if Saban likes UGA's Chub
should have thrown it there
I hate the fact that CFB is almost gone. I can't wait 7 months.
Maybe the Rose Bowl was actually the national championship.
Yeah I wasn''t done talking about that and the thread got locked. What the hell just happened. 
Wow.Schefty is like the guy from Pawn Stars
Honestly! That was an awesome quarter. But the first half sucked ass.
Not playing well
[deleted]
Georgia needs one of Michigan States patented 10 minute TD drives
Saban head is going to exploid
What's wrong with pineapple on pizza? 
Invite him over. 
I think it might be more of a TOP thing
They're all really quiet right now.  They'll crawl back into their pickups and beat their sisters.
I'm not an expert, but I do believe that due to Georgia having more points than Alabama that this means that Georgia has a higher chance for victory at this point
If UGA scores TD here it's over
Shutout to the man who yelled at the cameraman for filming in the injured Alabama player (on national tv nonetheless). I understand people want to see him and know he's okay, but the dude needs some space right now
Is this the drive that breaks the will of Alabama or does Alabama stand up and find a stop?
Give em that Holyfield knock out to end it
Beaver Tranqs and Rabies, the Thad Saban story
I seen it
If 2017 taught me anything it's that evil usually triumphs. 
If you're gonna let them get 6-8 yards up the middle every time we might as well call this game now
Michel is having a great game. Im sad for  Chubb lol
Damn, time for a big TD PASS
Indeed.
No come back shits lit
You know Nick Saban has glanced across the field a few times, eying up Smart, and thought "what have I created?"
Ayy lmao
Never thought I'd see Bama get dominated at the LOS so much.
Whelp, we are gassed. Those 3 and outs just bit us in the ass. Even if we get the ball back and score, our defense is not build to stand for that long.
So is Bama's front 7 officially tired now?
Yame2
TOP is heavy in their favor
Chubb*
This game has basically been over 50% Michel. Not even a half Chubb
Georgia's rungame is doing too good. Gonna leave too much time on the clock.
dawgs comone 
What?  No.
Disappointing if it didn''t 
What do ya mean I''ve been posting since September .
I would feel worse if they actually won tbh
He threw for 17 yards in the first half
Do we need to have an MVC throwdown in the Natty thread? I'm not above it
When was the last time georgia won the championship?
Fromm should have kept it there, a qb run could be big here 
\#chubsforchub
I saw it
Saban needed someone that could throw the ball.
Seriously--they started with all those passes to set this up.  Holy shit we'll see but it's possible Saban has been outcoached.
god i fucking hate that guy 
At least you've won a few in this century. 
[In case anyone missed the Bama player going after the coach at the end of the 3q post, here it is](https://twitter.com/Sports_Burd/status/950578597932294146)
Last game of the year, Brent. Can't hold anything back now. 
Anyone get the feeling that Saban will finish out Tua's career then retire?
gotta say this sounds of the game thing is nice
Fuckin Chubb! 
Special teams player on Bama 48 got a personal foul for throwing a punch at a UGA player, on the sideline he made a swing at one of the Bama coaches.
Guys, I think Georgia wants to win and they are willing it to happen.
WatchESPN went 8-bit on me, did the entire stadium have their cell flash lights on to support that kid....or was it just my resolution?
U guys think Quavo is watching this game? 
I wonder if #48 caught that freshman with crazy hands.
I went to high school with him, scared the life out of me to see that 
That's cold
Seent it. 
alabama #48
I don't see 48 out there. Look like fighting Saban was a bad idea
Georgia running game finally getting to the second level.  I'm finally starting to overcome my Atlanta-native inherent skepticism of all things sports...
Does Chubb suck? Or is Bama's d line that good?
Bama is gassed. Damn. My Bowl Mania came down to me and my brother in our group. He has UGA and I have Bama. 
Uga is dominating time of possession. Is Bama tired?
Play action on the second down would've been perfect 
gross
Bulleit
It only exists if you believe. 
The latter
I''m here for a good time, not a long time 
Just happens to pretty much any other team when they're close to beating Bama
[Alabama's Mekhi Brown losing his composure on the sideline.](https://twitter.com/CregStephenson/status/950578732846211073) for anyone who missed it!
Chubb isn''t really getting it done. I''d keep it in Michel''s hands 
Georgia has Alabama right where they want them, on third down.Edit: Well, not this time. Great rush.
WOO
Charles Barkley: see what Alabama needs to do is to score points now while keeping Georgia from scoring. I'm not sure that they're gonna be able to do that though because this defense if just turebel 
Saban has accepted his loss. 
Dam that chick I was talkin to on craiglist just text me lookin for that bj if them dawgs win
3rd and 5, Fromm time!
#metoo
No galleons for you then
20-10 GA winning
Chubb is not so hot today.
He was awake and conscious when they were carting him out so that's good sign
Pulled at halftime. Missed some throws and the Bama offense was looking like ass.
Hot take, sony's parents were paid off by Sony to get around the player sponsorship limits in CFB. Sony plays the long game. 
Michel's vision is no joke. Dude made two immaculate reads in that one run. 
Georgia still dominating TOP. We need to wear them out 
I saw my dudeTagged
Anybody got Lane Kiffin's number? I need to make a call
This run defense/tackling is embarrassing
Ignore him, if he comes over act like you don't know him.  Say you're from Earth-7.
This has been one of the more physical games I have seen all year. Every hit seems like a car accident. 
I know assume "neutral" Bama fans post from Russia while claiming to be in Kiev
Just let the good guys win for once!
I wanna die
Those financial woes don't happen because of good decisions 
Michel and Chubb have officially surpassed Gurley and Marshall for me
They''re waiting until the trophy is awarded to strike
Sony's official twitter account already tweeted about him lmao
You will have a dynastic football video game named after you 
Offense couldn't stay out on the field to rest them. Same shit happened last year.
Second self mole Porter mmmm
I think this year he'll have a picture of Tua on his phone...
The latter
At least during the season. When the offseason gets here people are nice. It''s just the regular season people that are toxic 
As the trophy is presented to the winning coach, a steel cage descends from the ceiling, trapping the winning team instead. Bats and brass knuckles are thrown in, as well as UCFs entire team in Kevlar and camo. Full team deathmatch. Last player standing wins the title for his team.
My theory as well
A sour out of Oregon. I wish they had saltys.
Yeah I'm waiting to see this too
Low blood sugar
Alabama #48
It's not over yet
Was that medical staff member trying to stop the camera person, saying, “you can''t film this”?
https://imgur.com/YveFROX
Nice
Dilly Dilly 
Scoreboard since Tau came in says otherwise 
Nice 
I wanna see UCF play Oklahoma :c
Real MVP
I mean he scored their only TD
My favorite!
You mean 26? 48 is who was throwing a punch at GA and his coach
Chubb just has not had a good game. I just want him to have a good run.
Well that killed that
Until just then.
Same as last year. Can't get off on third downs, too many snaps. 
I stand by the implant to shut his body down Bama puts in all of their players going off.
Georgia is like "look at me, I'm the Bama now."
How bout dem Dogs!
Ouch 
24-6
That's called a John Daly. 
Sony''s draft stock is getting better and better.
Never seen bama getting run on like this. This is crazy 
shit
Wait what OHgod I didn't think of it like that what the hell 
Malibu 
It always feels like that when you have the change of pace back. If you made Michel the full time runner, he wouldn't be as effective
If Saban loses two Natty''s in a row, is he done for good in T-Town? /s 
I love power running football. Hopefully that opens up deep passes for Fromm
Interesting form tackle
Goddamn goddamn 
Trent Dilfer: If a young man is having a serious medical condition on the sideline they need to stop the dang game.
Grown man sack.
Man's not hot
I would like to nominate "old bama sideline man" who yelled at the camera in front of that half conscious freshman for MVP.
Nothing warms my heart more than seeing a distraught Sabin.
What a douche. Saban should send him off. 
Unless you're talking about beer pong and natty light, you are correct
freshman alabama DB collapsed on the sidelines. he was alert on his way to the locker room, but on a stretcher. 
Eh, y'all have the numbers. Try being an Auburn fan.
No more Chubb, just Michel...
Damn he took a hit there
Damn
Especially in his first tough game. 
Threads get fairly large quickly. 
Surprised they didn't show that 48 scuffle. They would've had that on repeat if it was any other school above Dixieland.
Am I the only one who thinks Michel is much better than Chubb?
Hands to the face?
my dudes*
If georgia wins, I may need to take a few years off. Being a South Carolina fan sandwiched in between a Clemson natty and a georgia natty is just too much for my soul
If someone falls asleep during the national championship do you wake them up? 
I''m at full chubb 
Trying to figure out if Bama payed the refs or the playoff committee more.
that just saved the game. 
Chubb looks like the third string back out there, Michael and the freshman both look better.
Oh fuck, in the face
Cant leave too much time on the clock if you score.
NOW IS CHUBB TIME
Wasn't playing great, but neither has anyone on Bama. I think Saban made a big mistake
Touche
oof
Run this shit out
Slammed
Ga Tech is Atlanta area cfb team. Uga is everywhere else, so they are good.
TOP is 29 UGA and 18 Bama
There you go Davis!
No, you lost 50 bucks you didn't have because of you.
Damn that sucks 
Just monika 
Hurts is still Bama's leading rusher. 
Half Chubb you might say
Does Jake have State Farm insurance for that?
 Ouch
Bama's fault? 
The winner of this game plays UCF on a 5th quarter.
I was really cheated out of the last name lottery.  Having a name like HardMan or Chubb is badass.
Dawg fan hoping and praying for that Alabama player.
A huge stop right here, wow
Damn
Ugh
That''s assault, brotha 
Saban looks like he's about to cry lmao 
I really wish Ncaa would do what NFL does and have the little field on their website to watch the game on
Damn Fromm got his bell rung
"3rd down has been a strength of Georgia's tonight."You jinxed it
Has Jalen Hurts changed the background pic on his iPhone yet?
running game is working.      go back to passing lol.
Chubb is killing us rn.
Yikes that hit 
So is Gary at home just shitting himself from the though of Bama losing 
Trivia night at the bar has forced closed captions.This is bullshit
I'm watching this ESPN raw feed. The crowd sounds like there are no Bama fans there at all. 
Where the fuck did 99 come Fromm?
Oof
Looking  s little like the Rose Bowl 3rd quarter for Georgia. 
Whew

Chubb is ground and pound, which is what the NFL is coming back to in recent years, so he'll do well I think, but yeah Michel is the better overall back
And people complain about baseball games being too long
99 is a large human being.
We''re getting too conservative...
I can't believe I missed that...
[GIF of 48 losing it](https://twitter.com/Deadspin/status/950578313302601728)
I like this. Technically correct is the best type of correct
Frosh has 10 points in three possessions.  
We have a long ways to go if that''s the case.
Better than most broadcasts tbh
99 is a large human
Chubb is not running well against Bama
"Stunting isn't anything to me"Probably Nick Saban in the locker room
They say, they just don''t care. Georgia should try and hang 40 on them now.
[here](http://i0.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/facebook/000/016/212/manning.jpg)
fucking handegg
Already hated then all the dirty shit ain''t helpin dude
Put #48 for bama on the field for the entertainment value
ARE YOU RANCH DUBOIS???
Probably mad that he''s leaving?
didnt play that great in the first half; somewhat surprising he was benched at the start of the second half
We need to the run this ball. I'm just dumbfounded by our game plan. Why doesn't Scarborough or Harris have 20+ carries between them? What are we doing?
Malacer at the Palacer
Might be speaking too soon
99 might be good
This is 99's big night
Davis is too big to move that fast. 
Hes done more than hurts besides the now irrelevant int
Georgia calls some shitty plays on second down 
Really shouldn't have left Chubb in for more than one play.
Good hold on the ball
These defenses have been pretty impressive 
It'll be an honour in the offseason as well.
https://twitter.com/Deadspin/status/950578313302601728
Probably did that thing where you're public speaking and kinda lock your legs to stand up straight and you end up getting light-headed
I think so. After the injury Chubb just doesn''t have the explosiveness he used to have. It''s a shame but he just doesn''t have that burst anymore and I think it''s really going to hurt him at the next level. 
I'll set you up...what's updog? 
Number 48 for Bama
I like both of these team's uniforms
[**"I know I'm asking a lot, you guys, but hunker it down one more time!"**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3NA1wlxM_0)
Good. Comeback time
Should have thrown on 2nd down.
 Yay another punt!!
**DARN IT GEORGIA!**
Minus the constant Dies Irae spam
Bama
Just wait, if the Pats make the Superbowl again the salt levels will be astronomical in /r/nfl
He got through so fast he thought it was a screen
why the fuck would you sub out Michel for Chubb 
Beast
Si Se Puede stream with pledge and no no no lag.
Clorox atm
Well he had it during an ESPN show. CNN would do the same if it happened behind Anderson on a remote shot. 
Does anyone else enjoy this more than those games where it's rush for 1 yard and punt?Like yea it usually means you're watching an elite defense, but...
Man's not hot
UGA''s inside run game makes terrible commercials?
They''re B1G refs actually :/
This is still a game!
Same
Yep. Also did Boy's State one summer where they lined us up in formation and stuff every morning and that was rule #1. Do not lock your knees. You will pass out. Sure enough, some idiots didn't listen and they dropped like flies.
This game has a really good balance of offense defense and crazy.
Welp, here''s Bamas chance.(Nice punt)
So one of my friends is in the KU marching band and he told me that the players are some of the biggest dicks he's ever met. They think they're hot shit and the best players ever because they get a lot of money from boosters, and he said it didn't help after KU announced the renovations to the stadium. They think that because they're a "D1" football player that they're the best lol. EDIT: I meant the boosters give money to the program, not the players themselves. I imagine the "player money" goes to the basketball team.
that was a good rive too, shit way to end it, ugh...
Don''t pull a Falcons please Georgia.  
so does college not have the "Blow to the Head" penalty thing
What happened exactly? I missed it Edit: Nvmd. Found the link: https://mobile.twitter.com/NOTSportsCenter/status/950578690341076992/video/1
Run more time off before the snap! Georgia keeps leaving 12-15 seconds on the play clock.
Why try to throw? Run the fucking ball it was working perfectly. No situational awareness
I wouldn't pass another time if I was Georgia 
Bama has life!
Now THAT'S the kind of conspiracy theory I like to see 
https://mobile.twitter.com/Claudio_GSN/status/950578249888882688Not a gif but video 
Baka losing their cool
On your knees fella
That's such a weird thing to see, considering that that's Alabama's MO - wear out the other team as much as you can and then just run over them.Seeing Georgia do it to Alabama is fun.
Fromm going to be tasting that man for breakfast tomorrow.
WatchESPN is just freezing constantly now. 
OMG this game is soooooooo BOOOOOORRRRRIIIIIIINNNNNNNGGGGGG. I''m nodding off watching this.....3 yards and a cloud of dustCut away to SatanCut back 3 yards and a cloud of dustEdit:Fuck Willy Taggart
Love the les mis on 3rd down #classy
# Go DAWGS!!!
I feel 0% confident we win it by keeping hurts in though.
If they care you do
Center blew that blocking scheme
How dare they touch Jake
Georgia knows where the Bama D is soft, Kirby built it and left his scraps behind to try and run his system.  Over. 
There's a dark dystopian sci-fi novel wherein parents sell the naming rights to their children in there somewhere
boi
Check tinder
big dawgs gotta eat
Enjoy another year without a natty
Aside from the blown calls, this has been a great game! Absolute slugfest
From a guy and Jake, I promise you he doesn''t find that funny.
go dawgs then
Cleveland blew that bad.
let's go D
Real talk, I'd bet a fellow student rolls Toomer's tonight.
Some John Madden level insight there. Lol. 
Easy killer
ouch
I joke about  watchespn a lot but holy shit...every single snap...lag....once the whistle is blown......beautiful picture clear sound, perfect...like wtf?  
The band is playing Les Miserables right???
the commercial break is over. someone tell the Bama D
We really didn't need that to fucking happen. God damn
Well that hurt....
The year is 2018SEC finally destroyed all resistance and met in Natty> 'Ladies and Gentlemen, I am your front reporter bakonydraco and we are with our chief analyst meatfrappe here today to cast this epic final showdown between Alabama Crimsontide and Gerogia Hate here in Merced-----WAIT WHAT WAS THAT?!!!!'The entrance suddenly blast open with smoke> 'IT....

sabin pls
That definitely makes a huge impact as well. 
Proof that Sony is best.You don't see any players names Microsoft out there.
Shitty to end that with a sack, but great drive as far as running the ball. Like shit through a tin horn for a bit there. 
They run two diff styles, Michel is much better suited for this D.
Man Bama's band has a big sound
A list of things that are dirtier than how Alabama plays:1. Uhhhh???
They can only sustain us so long
Even with that sack, Bama is starting to look a little worn down.
Nice to see Raekwon's reemergence
42 might have saved his scholarship if he hasn''t lost it already
>HonourWhy'd you spell it like that?
NFL Gurley though
I could only wish...
Serious question: why would any refs, specifically B1G refs, be biased towards Alabama? Poor state. Mid to small media markets. It don't make no damn sense. 
Just khakis
It seemed kinda fucky. Hurts is something like 20 something and 2 as a starter according to Kirk Herbstreit. Saban just blew that all away because of a mediocre half only down 13
Raekwon Davis with the team on his back
If bama scores to close it to a one score game, yes. 
No, there's at least three of us.
So you found a hooker
That's one of the nastiest sacks ever.
I have a few guesses... low blood sugar, dehydration, maybe he was holding his breath to see if it''s actually possible to die from holding your breath and found out you can''t...Probably blood sugar though.
Damn it first 
It's been a good year
Yes
Gentlemen, it has been a pleasure game threading with you this season. May September come swiftly, May your croots sign in your favor, and may your off season shit posts be of quality.
If my surname were Chubb you'd better believe I wouldn't waste it naming my son Nick
Try watching a CBS SEC game.
woof woof woof 
[deleted]
I really want to be enjoying this game, but it's hard when today is the anniversary of the time in 1297 when François Grimaldi, disguised as a monk, lead his men to capture the fortress protecting the Rock of Monaco, establishing his family as the rulers of Monaco.
Kinda leaving Bama hangin, aren't you?
lmaoooooo
I prefer Microsoft
SI has a gif of ithttps://twitter.com/SInow?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor
Ill show 100% Chubb if them Dawgs beat Bama!
You tried 
Surprise . . . she has the penis
been low-key loving the "Band-off" that's been constantly in the background so far
Dat Bama money
Everything in balance... I guess
They're running these plays a little too fast for me. Snapping the ball with 10+ seconds on the play clock is criminal right now
Scott Frost driving a beer truck spraying the fuck out of Nick Saban 
THanks John Madden
No. 
You know Michel is special when he can make NICK CHUBB look like he's running in slo-mo.
After that missed block that return was going nowhere.
I'm not rooting for you but hat young man is having a hell of a night
Yuri 4 life
A habit, you might say 
It's a bama fan looking to forget and he meant for him not for you.
QUALITY LOSS LURCHES CLOSER TO IMMORTALITY. 
Work tomorrow?
No lane.
LES MIS
Tastes like stale sweat and rage.
God damn it lmao
Was I married to you?
You are giving her a BJ?
He''s gotta be feeling a swirling mix of frustration, confusion and pride.
Alabama has made timely stops on D but their offense has to NOT SUCK. 
Lololol
*Flair is Bulldog team*This checks out.
Damn #99 is a beast
Did you miss the third quarter? 
https://twitter.com/NOTSportsCenter/status/950578690341076992
You could perhaps say his performance has been flaccid
Maybe they are running a rope-a-dope?
The "Anyone But Bama" Train is now boarding
I was going to go to bed at half and try to sleep off this cold but I couldn't miss the last half of the season!
#DONT YOU (FORGET ABOUT ME) 
I always hated having all receivers on one side. Unless it's a rollout
It's a Georgia thing 
i really wanna hear sabans locker room ass chewing after this game
Should have called for a fair catch
Checkmate
I will die. 
Can''t call your cousin “that chick”
He's been showing up this game, for damn sure
Well he gets to pad his record against his former assistants when they play UT next year.
CFB Gods, is a comeback in the cards?
Heat collapse in a temperature controlled dome? 
Thanks madden 
Yeah we look gassed on defense. They've been out there a lot 
Maybe don't gamble with money you don't have then.
99 for Alabama is incredible
198-AFUCKINGLONGTIMEAGO
48 for Bama is ready
That car big enough for all his baseball gear?
Bama Offense needs to mount a long drive their Defense is out of it
Bama needs at least a field goal on this drive.
the hell?
I want to get excited but I'm nervous Saban made a deal with the Devil.
So when does UCF start playing?
99 is so good goddamn
Herbstreet is actually good
Hey
Tua comeback time
Microsoft is my new nickname for Baker Mayfield
Big, if true
they're not up enough to pull a falcons
It's not a shocking insight and no, you're not the only one. You're about the 500 commenter in the last five minutes. Michel is having a better game than Chubb, no doubt. Good and bad games happen. 
It fits the subs narrative
I mean that the last 2 minutes will take at least thirty in real time
I know we're ahead, but I don't feel comfortable :(
I have that same feeling I had about this time in the super bowl 
Welcome to my world
I think he heard you...
BUT MUH NARRATIVE
Vegas
seriously.
Mack Brown and Colt McCoy send their regards.
99 came up after that sack and i expected some celebration but he just looked gassed 
put hurts back in what do you have to lose
Nothing. I'm still high off of beating Michigan and Clemson getting stomped in the Sugar Bowl. 
Lol
They have a better chance with him than Hurts
That''s terrible to hear. Hope he''s ok and it''s something small, like being nervous over the occasion. 
This has a Super Bowl feeling to it.
Number 48 took a swing at a coach after getting a penalty for punching a Georgia player. 
THANK YOU
Then don't watch? Georgia's O-Line is way fun to watch
That was some ass blocking by that georgia lineman jesus
Why?!? Don't touch that shit. 
the Dan Le Batard mega cast is slowly becoming infinitely better than this football game
I think so tooHe won the Rose Bowl after all 
I think they're just extra focusing on him
I feel like there's not enough attention being payed to a player trying to assault his own coach 
That fucker looks like he got two legs for arms.
Feels like Bama is about to turn it over again. Missing their best OL. Freshman QB. Search your heart. You know it to be true.
LOOK DOWN
it's been driving me nuts all night. it's like andy reid is coaching them. 
Thank god they have Michel
Depends on the person. If it's me? Yes
probably vasovagal or dehydration
You know there's some good, quality, hearty shit talk going on down there on both sides.
99 is a big boi and he''s scaring me along with Georgia''s QB
DAMN that was a good move. 
?
Choo choo!
Please no
Ew teams playing defense ew
Hey Taco BellThe Illuminati is not a frivolous subject/s
Wtf is this asshat doing
He's trying to get cut. 
Shhhhh... I'm boycotting the game too. 
I kinda agree with you
Good to hear y''all have some introspection on how awful yalls band is.
Bama looks tired.  And Chubb probably isn't very tired.
Thats an odd way to describe what just happened.
Or frank
Invite him over duh
Is this really surprising?
Not playing well. 
I was rooting for Iowa State but never again. Go on and fade back in perpetual suck.
We get it, you dont know what defense is
Could just be dehydration really.
Yeah that was the guy going after the coach. What a dumbass. I meant the shove to the back of Fromm's head though. 
And then they get sacked lol
Fuck me. I have a job ESPN
I wanted Clemson - Oklahoma, but this is a fun game.
Saban''s gotta be feeling a swirling mix of frustration, confusion and pride about Smart at Georgia right now. He''s got some competition.
So, observations on these RBs?
4* recruit Nintendo gonna blow up next year 
Subscribe
bruh
Pls no...
Then watch something else, like project runway, or the bachelor 
Why were they snapping the ball with 10+ seconds left?
All that state farm commercial is remind of that ducking depressing episode of Futuram Luck of the fryrish
He should go to the Ravens.
Next season 
Because people need every reason to hate dominate teams.
This is football the way it was meant to be played.
Why aren''t you killing time Georgia? Run the ball!
Now, that's something I'd pay for
You''ve never seen a Bama game before?
Bama can't afford to go 3 and out here. That D needs a break, especially that defensive line. 
Fuckin Tebow trying to sell me a car
Yes sir
Harry 
Dilly dilly!
Tebow still getting commercial work.Good for him.
If you're Georgia, why even pass?
Georgia needed to burn more clock.  They were snapping the ball with more than 10 seconds left.
Cameron Nizialek is the best transfer (not named Jake Ganus) we've ever had 
Lol..
You dont hate your child that much do you?
Player or fan?
All these people complaining about a bad game have apparently never seen a defensive battle before
HERE COMES UCF WITH THE STEEL CHAIR
We're basically Alabama with more likeable staff and players at this point 
Hype machine is all I can come up with 
Here's the video of 48 attacking a coach for those who missed it.https://twitter.com/NOTSportsCenter/status/950578690341076992
TEBOW INTENTIONALLY TRIED TO HIT THE ELEPHANT. FUCK ALABAMA.
Roquan is rested and he is a-hungry 
WatchESPN is hot garbage. Lost connection right before that sack . . .
What a crappy car. Should have kept going and hit the elephant.
Why? It's not like he's going to get attention quicker.
Kirby must be really good at mind games. Oklahoma: “we should run the ball.” Alabama: “let''s try passing it.”
Fuck the Pats. 
Yea r/cfb retweeted it.
They do
- Michel breaks off three first downs in a row- Put in Chubb- 3 and out 
alright guys, let's hold off on the Bama eulogies for a bit longer.Let's wait until their offense fucks this up again
Never Bama!
You would have to pay me a lot of money to go up against 99 even for a play. He just threw at 300+ pound dude to the side like a rag doll
This game is gonna end bananas 
Can''t see how Georgia loses this one. Now that the run game is going it''s in the bag. 
Bama DLine is naaaasty
How is Pruitt not calling an all out blitz every play Fromm doesn't have the composure to go through his reads with 4 people trying to kill him. 
[removed]
I swear if Bama wins this game after all this shit
Flair Brothers
This is patrick
Someone said the Spanish cast is lag free
Not used to seeing competent defense are you?
>The car stopped for me.Tim tried to kill Al, dudes.
Good job for him
Well he does have the biggest number.That's how that works, right?
Yes, Look Down
I don't think we're watching the same game
O-H!
Did Tebow intend to run that mascot over? 
did 48 ever get back in the game?
So... exactly what did he think he was going to accomplish there? 
what is that NBA commercial dear lord
The National Championship
Possibly because you''re used to big 12 defense?
Maybe he tried to get high by doing the blowing into your thumb thing. 
saban about to have coach k style back pain
Nice
S E C S P E E D
No. :) 
Yeah but still
Upvote the last CFB thread of the season folks!
The center should probably pick up his block 
#Prayers4fluriduh
Tebow always sounds dissapointed that the car didn't let him hit Big Al
What time does everyone have to get up for work tomorrow? 
And at least baseball doesn't artificially stop the game for commericals
UCF has already been announced the unofficial champion
That #48 is walking home
We step away from commercial action for another game break.....
Is it Alabama that plays Les miserables?
All y'all saying this game trash.... Sorry y'all can't recognize real football. 
Will the Pat White that was promised save Alabama?
If he wins, he's gonna be drowning in coeds. He won't have to worry about that sack tomorrow
Oh man, rip that guys spot.  
Is the ice cream van guy in the tax act commercial the same one who wants to "meet me at the club" in the apple commercial?!
ESPN building that Tebow stock hard this year. 
Apple Michel could only get into Georgia tech
Link?
Feels
Anyone get the license plate of that truck that just ran over Fromm, my god
http://www.totalprosports.com/2018/01/08/alabama-lb-mekhi-brown-punches-georgia-player-then-erupts-on-sidelines-at-coaching-staff-video/
That's some nice Tim tebow acting
He has been everywhere tonight not surprised
That explains why KU has players.
And miss seeing more punches? Gotta stay alert, we hockey now
I know a guy named Paul Richard Cannon.Still can't believe he doesn't go by P. Dick Cannon.
After last week apparently. They talked about it earlier. 
Down to the final beer, let''s go DAWGS
Is Tim Tebow still claiming to be a virgin?
Tebow was gonna hit the elephant guy
Lmao what the fuck is Tebow doing
I really wish they had a chance.
Hey fellow fan!
Omg, no way?!
Nah you lost 50 bucks you didn't have because u dumb
Go to espn news. Coaches making this enteresting.
We know. We know.
I like the Super Bowl we at least has a half decent drive 
Good on #42 for being on top of the situation. 
He's playing really damn well. Good for that kid to be doing it on the biggest stage for him so far.
Roll tears!
Zeke ran all over them in the 2015 playoff
Fuck, commercial break in the coaches room. ESPN figured us out!
Raekwon davis is a monster. 6'7 300 lb of muscle
*Judd Nelson fist in air*
"Thank God I get to sit down"
Not over yet. 
Friends rooting for GA.Girlfriend rooting for Bama.I'm rooting for some fuckin' overtime!!!
This Alabama team is dirty as fuck!
Same. Especially whatever he says to 48
stoooop
Lol he died a while ago 
That commercial made it seem like Tebow was trying to hit Bama''s mascot 
Georgia''s RBs are just unfair lol 
We celebrated earlier in the day as to not interfere with the game.
LOL he'll certainly be eating ass if this score holds up
Agreed. I''m screaming to run Michel. He''s got the edge. 
Yo
lol
Where the fuck is that coming from?
we havent' been good... ever.. at football.Basketball though, bring it on!!!!
It boarded when the committee selected them, we're bout to reach the destination.
I''ve basically been shitfaced since we beat Portland State by 3 in week zero
I don't get the Bammers geting a sack and talk shit when they're about to blow a natty? How can you be in celebrate spirit there. 
Disgraceful. Don''t wanna see him in crimson and white again. 
Bullshit! It's better 
As a Falcons fan, I hate you. As a Georgia Tech fan, I hope you're right
think the argument is more "make sure the game is competitive until the end"
my god this needs to happen
Even though Georgia''s defense has been handling them most of the game, I never feel like Alabama is out of it
No clue why he tried to run with that. He was surrounded the second he caught it.
Im prepping my meme's dont fail me Georgia
Cut to fistfight and/or cannibalism on the Bama sideline
No
Off the field right now. Assault 
GOD DAMNIT GEORGIA, RUN SOME FUCKING OFFENSE!
I want to hang out with Tim Tebow.He just seems like the best dude.
Oh yeah, I''ll find me a athletic woman and name my firstborn Microsoft. Imma Lavar Ball it. Although to outweigh being 5''9'''' and 205 pounds I need to find one hell of a woman.
TIL
I thought I was the only one who noticed
You're a D1 player for a team that'd lose to half of the D2 teams. lol
Jurassic Bark is the worst for me. 
Well.........bye.
The ESPN commercial with "user generated content" isn't nearly as far from the truth as ESPN thinks
Guys what's the score?
I think they're just wildly inconsistent if Tua was consistently throwing those deep bombs it'd be a whole different game
Richard
Playing from behind so they are panicking
Shut up
Pile of money from boosters isn''t obvious enough?
RIP Fromm
Step up again defense, no give!!
Because there''s “expectations” for Alabama. And you don''t want to look like you DONT want to give it to Bama, which ends up making you look like you want to give it to Bama.
Man, put 48back, we need some entertainment
That sack was actually probably better than an incompletion.
r/cfbstreams 
1980
I'm a neutral so I enjoy every year without a natty. 
Tim Tebow RUN OVER THE ELEPHANT!
So I don't really follow college football, but looking at his numbers, is Jalen Hurts the college Alex Smith?
If they can get points on this drive, it's nothing to be too worried about.
You saying you haven't seen the tide play rough the whole game?
He ded 
Whoever wins is going to destroy some ATL strip clubs 
New theory about the collapsing player: Saban poisoned him to show Jalen what would happen to him if he tried to transfer.
Is there an ESPN channel for just the Bama sideline?
https://twitter.com/Claudio_GSN/status/950578249888882688
Do dudes count?
Michel is doing well. Chubb is doing well. Alabama's rbs are underwhelming.
It's on the ESPN app, go to the game in the app and it's one of the videos 
Then I'll be happy. 
He should still be playing in the NFL.
Bama memes can''t melt steel beams
Sooooon. Soon. 
Okay Andy Bernard
Omg fuck watchespn
Raekwon "The Chef" Davis
And Phantom of the Opera! I dig it.
Happens when you go 3 and out almost every drive except 1.
Excited for you guys if you pull it off
When Saban dosed his players with steroids, he forgot there are some pretty serious side effects. 
I appreciate your insight and hope McDonald is truly ok. While I have you here, how excited should I be about Heupel?
Well, they did beat Texas
Because your coach is Satan
I see Michel out there.I see a good play.I see Chubb out there.I see a bad play.
This is going to sound ridiculous, because it is, but the girl with the freckles in that iPhone commercial makes me uncomfortable as fuck.
This is too much for me right now
I see Clevland went with the Catalina style block there. 
I'm rooting for the Dawgs, but I still don't really see how someone could justify not letting UCF into the playoffs.
Ass won''t stop slappin''
Yes
WatchESPN app has multiple streams. The ‘main'' stream you''d expect on tv and a couple alt streams that aren''t the normal kind of broadcast. Command stream has 2 separate views and stats on screen at all times
Now's the time for Nick Frost to run in with the Money in the Bank briefcase.
Pay with your face? No thanks apple. 
This comment will be underappreciated. 
I know that's a golf joke but I don't golf but I've def heard that before
iPhone X: Now featuring the most irritating commercials imaginable.
dude he just made 74 his bitch
Chubb has had a great career at UGA, but he's killed 3 drives with negative yardage runs 
Tebow was going to murder the elephant
He got shot in the leg once
4:30 Central. 
Player, CB just got stretchered off the field.
Jalen Hurts might wana to use the Microsoft Surface Tablets on the sideline to fill out transfer applications
My WatchESPN stream just got a lot better. I guess a lot of people bailed at the end of the third quarter?
Tide goes in tide goes out. You can''t explain that..
I'm a little rusty on my penalty rules, but was there not Hands to the Face on that third down?
**TOOT TOOT** MOTHERFUCKERS 
There is a lot of NFL talent on the field.
You think there would be an ass chewing?Seasons over, he can chew their asses next season
one of the best in the business
Thanks for this one. I meant the shove on the back of Fromm's helmet though. 
Hot take:Bama should put their QB with almost-won-a-National-Championship experience instead of a true freshman who had a freak perfect TD drive
I can't believe y'all complaining about this game. This shit is tense!
Has Saban lost control of his Alabama team?
A teacher told me not to do it.
never 4get
Idk, CFB is just too sloppy compared to NFL playoffs 
Raekwon Davis is the player you create in NCAA 14 and feel guilty about it Bc he couldn''t actually exist
Tebow: “the car stopped for me?”Does Tebow want to bounce Big Al off his windshield?
You''re the real MVP
not tonight you don't
new reddit who dis
We upgraded from brain dead to on a ventilator on offense. 
Rick would have been so much better.
If that's how KU football players act I can't imagine what *actually* good D1 teams are like
20-10 Dawgs
But what if I want to hear Kirk Herbstreet and his amazing insight........
Automatic breaks sound great till you're the cars third owner and it decides to lock em up doing 70 on the highway.
Big, athletic D-linemen are a coach's wet dream.
No flag for shoving Fromm's head to the ground after the play? Hmmmmm.
AND HERE COMES UCF WITH THE MONEY IN THE BANK BRIEFCASE!!! THEY ARE GONNA CASH!!!!
Not if they keep snapping it with 15 seconds on the play clock.  Literally gave Bama an extra minute in the game on that drive.
20-10
Im just happy to see a somewhat close game
Me too, gotta be up at 5:30
Hush your mouth, Georgia boy!
20-10
Who knows, but they are
That ESPN NBA commercial was great
Superbowl
Seriously. These commercials are unfuckingbelievable.
You name him Richard so he can then go by the traditional nickname and be known as Richard "Dick" Chubb.
Up in here, asking the important questions.
Doesn't count in the butt!
I hate Alabama more than anything but I really don''t think they''ve been that bad. Yeah, some missed calls but it happens every game
Did Apple just mix every race into one girl and throw a nose ring on her?
[removed]
He's getting hit behind the line a lot. Maybe he's being too patient. 
Just want to say, regardless of who wins, the support of all fans with no stakes in this game has been unreal. The fuck Bama train is a glorious thing.Edit: sorry for leaving out Notre Dame fans, yall have been on the UGA train since week 2. Much appreciated. 
Alright, Tua, here's your chance to become an instant legend. Let's go!
I seen it
Not sure if username checks out or REALLY DOESN'T check out
Yeah really surprised they held on to him after he went all those years without winning a game
#AS YOU WALK ON BY 
D needs a nice long break courtesy of a long drive resulting in 7 
Cue glass shattering 
They''re not used to good defenses in the first place
It''s a 10 point game with 12min left. Definitely not over 
He takes the dirt road for purity purposes. 
What name would you choose?

Saban vs Brown cage match
The ever so small "Anyone but Georgia" train is also taking people
They fired everyone to pay for quality streaming services.
Only 3 hours to get to the beginning of the fourth quarter. 
20-10 UGA 12ish minutes left 
He died like 5 years ago. And he was let go before that. Huge scandal
if Bama goes 3 and out their defense will all faint.
Come on Georgia! Hunker down one more time!
Bama band rocking the Les Mis making me slightly less disgusted by them right now
Apple has seriously decided to just go pure dystopia with the iphone advertising at this point"BRIGHT FAST FLASHING LIGHTS AND COLORS! NONSENSE SYLLABLES! GIVE US YOUR FACE!"
Ok time to reset, Bama. Let's turn things around
Kansas players getting money? Why not just light it all on fire?
TFW you can make your face a singing poop but not plug your headphones in
I can't wait for the football season to be over so I never have to watch an iphone animoji commercial again.
Steelers and Bengals
How is Bama still in this game???
Hate how apple gets average looking people for their commercials
Yep. This is not the Chubb that was promised
20-10 UGA 12:00 left
#DAWGS UP!!!
Dude is probably already kicked off the team. You'll see him on Last Chance U.
Had to tack on an /s!
In the past two year Bama has lost 100 % of their natl title games when one of their coordinators has a head coaching job. Will today be any different? 
0530 EST :*(
Sorry, come again? Your SEC was leaking. 
They looked similar against Auburn
Tebow cant even speak his lines right
penalties dont matter against bama this game
You think Bama boosters are paying refs despite the complete and lutter lack of evidence? 
Ill eat my sock if we win.
I''m fine with crowning UCF the National Champions. This game is a shit show. 
Fromm and his happy hands are making me nervous. Stop flipping the ball around in the pocket buddy. 
I've always thought the implication was that he wanted to run his ass over. 
I wouldn't blame him
You know his dad wanted to name him Richard...Mom goes, how bout Nick instead 
ESPN has a hard-on for Bama, and they have as big a hand in the CFP as the NCAA. 
Nissans are so cheap 
And female assistant
Just play both Harrises. Najee is everything Bo is, but quicker
I love the completely off topic comments these threads always bring
I want to see #48 and the coach fight after the game. Hell in a cell style. 
Is Alabama going to show up or just roll over?
Nope, children are terrible.
How does Tebow get commercials?  
Jerry Lawler should call these games

Seriously...chubb isn't built to run vs Bama. Michel is. Cheney is pissing me off this half
What are you all drinking to finish this bad boy out? 
Alabama is gonna win everyone just prepare yourself for the worst.

No he fucked several NFL teams.  
They just want to keep the Dawgs down.
Go cocks amirite
Fuck going to work! 
What is Dan Le Batard admitting to? Is he in an affair? 
Funemployment!!
As somebody not naming children you've gotta go with Richard
It's in Atlanta so that's not too shocking
I don't want to stereotype, but the Bama fans at this bar are fatter than the UCF fans.
 Didn't apple get sued because a Chinese woman's co-worker was able to unlock her phone with the face id?
Those tricks will still be there 2 days from now
Is this a protestant/catholic thing?
So by this logic B1G refs should be biased towards Rutgers?
Don't forget to take a moment and pour a shot out for Auburn tonight
The only thing that can make this even better is if we can get a sideline shot of Alabama's strength coach gluing the broken runner-up trophy back together with about 3 minutes left. 
Apple Marketing team:  Let's cast the strangest, most diverse looking people we can find on the streets for portrait shots.
Guarantee the Nissan Rogue is smarter than Tebow
Isn't real football constant blown coverage resulting in 55-52 games? 
WTF are you watching? Did you accidentally put Jacksinville vs. Buffalo on by mistake?
This feels much more like an NFL game than a college one. 
I''m just here because I don''t want CFB to end
Very true
And tackle Simon Pegg?
The addiction network must have a lot of cash to throw around to advertise during this game. 
Big Al and Hairy going to the National Championship while Tebow going to baseball practice
Thank god for mountain time zone
Jesus locked the door for him
Not against Bama. Bama can do no wrong this game.
The offensive line is holding strong
20-10 Georgia
Michel's been killing it and they go with slow ass no urgency lose yards Chubb.
do you wanna meet me in da lounge?
Those things being hit with sticks are called drums. At Stanford you would call that “a toaster”
Way to sacrifice for your country and HD TV.
Gotta love Myrtle Beach...
Same reason Bama is in this game at all
holy shit thanks for reminding men that that's a thing i can watch
Thanks
If Georgia loses I'll be sad. Don't let me go to bed sad
Refs treating Alabama like they're Michigan this game
I think he was
Richard?
Anyone else hear that as "Shitty Wok, Shitty, shitty wok!"
I see Michel out there. I think, "yes".I see Chubb out there. I think, "no".
Bama always- win or lose- plays like a team made of terrified prisoners.  I never see real joy from anyone on this team.  Coach or player.  I mean wtf is Saban doing to these kids.  
I got a bad feeling about this...we need one more TD.
Can you fair catch a ball if it bounces?
I'll never consider Nissan because fuck Tebow
except that one with the hot chick from last week
Has that ever happened?
Oh don''t give me that bullshit. The game was shit in the first half. Third quarter was good though. 
6:30. Not terrible, but not preferable.
Booo
I''ve only seen that called in the nfl
Thanks
Side note [look at this dog I saw today](https://i.imgur.com/8E3QNeX.jpg) (i'm a vet in Knoxville)

I always wonder if that's what they're implying...
If we get a stop here I'll start believing. 
NBA prime time
Ayy fuck bama
Do we bark now or...?
Consider being a teacher, but we have shitty conditions and a massively high burnout rate.  Not everything is rainbows and puppies for us teachers
Unless we get overtime. 
0530 here :(
Let's get it!
I love you
He would fuck up and we would call him Nick Frostdow and he would fade into irrelevance.
Gundy is so quiet!  Like just quietly watching with confident contempt like he thinks he could dismantle both these defenses.  I''m not sure he could or couldn''t.  But I''m sure he thinks he can. 
Refs
I thought the same until the replay.  He was on the chest and shoulders.
Refs 7 dawgs 20 bama 3
Especially in this game with the Alabama football Illuminati pulling strings. 
Thanks
NCAA 2005 Update: My Gators D forced a quick 3 and out and Arkansas' punter didn't let off a good punt so the Gators will begin their first drive at the Arkansas 42 yard line with 4:06 to go in the 1st. The score is 0-0, and to clarify I'm already at Week 9 of the ***2018 season*** in my dynasty so all the players are made up and the stats don't matter
99 just man handled that lineman holy hell.
Fukem
He sacrificed one player and one scholarship. 
Such a bold statement to go with those uniforms on this huge stage
IDK man that player looks pretty heavy 
Punctuation, key to life.
This is going to be really sad when Georgia blows this one
r/therewasanattempt
I interpreted that commercial as Tebow wanting to mow over his rivals'' mascots
I feel like we need to throw one out in the flat to Yeldon. 
Saban has lost control
It's way too early to focus on running clock down, they're trying to score as they should
Carl?
You mean 2nd? Must suck only winning 4 titles in 9 years!
I hope Lewis Grizzard can pick up ESPN where he's at. 
I for one eagerly await your co-championship with UCF
Said no one ever
20-10, uga on top

I like low scoring grind-ball games, but ESPN kills the flow and makes me hate it.
No
**DON'T YOU DARE OKLAHOMA THIS GEORGIA.**
Last game thread before off season 
Exactly. Time to switch to bourbon. 
Everyone thinks that 
Lol wtf is wrong with you? Might as well flair up as Alabama.
You chose poorly.
The circlejerk needs to fuel its hate.
They say you don't choose the app, but the app chooses... oh wait a second, its buffering.

If they want to brag about being D1 football players they should try and win more than 1 D1 game every season.
Fun Fact: Money from Alabama works in the rest of the United States

Watching the film room on ESPNnews is amazing, love the analysis by the coaches

I love Todd but never felt like he gave it his 100% after his injury, understandably so though he had mouths to feed.

Lol sure
Nothing better than watching good punts 
If we can''t get points on this drive, it''s over. 
Fuck that guy
Just change one letter, and boom, perfection.
What would you name him?   I was thinking if I was Asian I''d name him Phat 
Yeah, they market the NBA like bosses.
Nothing says *trust* like naming your self-driving car a *rogue*

im with you, something about her movements bother me
Will you call my name
Your meme's what?
sadder than the dog episode don't @me
Obviously you haven't watched the game. These refs are pathetic and being stubborn against a Georgia home crowd. Missed face mask. Garbage offsides call. TERRIBLE sideline calls. If these refs aren't fighting the crowd, then they're just pathetic in general.
Having good wholesome fun and getting paid. 
Somewhere Colt McCoy is laughing his ass off
better educated though
Eye test
The B1G doesn't care for your facemask rules.
Show the bad side of being a teacher, like the high school kids.
Damn, I gotta say, I dont mind sticking through the glitchy espn app when its the skycam view... No announcers, madden style overhead view lets you see all the running gaps/receiver levels 
Chubb out there: Run to wear them downSony out there: 15 yardsWho is better ??
Can't wait to see him on last chance U.
Simon Pegg best join him.
Must be all those extra championships
Get a fucking alexa
Because refs being fallible human beings wouldn't make sense. Conspiracy is more fun
[deleted]
That's been hanging over my head today as well. I feel ya man
better than the "whats a computer??" commercial 
Because Michel was tired after 4 straight run plays
Lol we've reached the point of no return. No matter how we win, if we win, we will have ascended to an even higher level of being the CFB heel that I didn't think was possible.
Isn''t it like 60 degrees in that stadium?
Fuck bama
Michel just seems faster through holes tonight. Around 100 yards I think now
Gotta get a breather at some point I guess
channel that super bowl magic
What we need is administrations to actually have teachers backs and not let students walk all over them by being scared of a lawsuit. 
Alabama should just put Hurts in as a decoy. 
What the fuck ticket clinic 
Scott Frost, but this comment has me rolling on the floor lol
Inb4 Georgia players are secretly just UCF guys in skin suits and that they finally get Bama
To be honest I wouldn't mind these commercial breaks nearly as much if it wasn't the same 4 shitty DirecTV and Barry Culpepper Dr. Pepper ads over and over and over and over again
Michel has been solid all game, I like Chubb but he's struggling
Did I miss something!?
Now hold up... the Irish fans have been on the Dawgtrain all season
Saban probably bitched about it on the radio. 
Here's my prediction for the final.Establishing shot: Huge Ken Burns-esque pan of the football stadium.Close up to Jalen Hurts:  The tide has turned finally for the Alabama Elephants. They are ahead in the waning seconds of the game! Alabama's line goes into victory stance, center snaps the ball, BUT WAIT! Hurts starts back pedalling because the true blue son of Sam that he refuses to take a knee (my ass). He fumbles the ball and the ball goes into the end zone and a Georgia defender lands on it. Touchdown! Georgia wins. Mark Richt french kisses his wife. 
You're not alone
No
"you dumb mofucka"
What a time to be alive
I think people are saying that because they think they are trying to keep the game close for money. Wouldn't be saying that if you were winning. Just my opinion though.

Nah, he got fucked by High A pitching.
Never ending high

I just got an espn app notification about it as well they have the video
You know what I would have paid for?A Lane Kiffin live stream during this game
The nose on Alabama's elephant is shaped like old man dick
Just remember to roll as you're going to the ground. You might be ok
And even less flags on Bama*hur dur hur dur bama* - /r/cfb
When Georgia scores, I think "yes"   When Bama scores, I think "no"
Bama gunna say there werent motivated for this game just looking forward to the final game vs UCF 
That pay tho
Nothing would be more true to athletics in the state of Georgia than blowing this shit though. 
HQ is LIVE BOIES.  Lets go play some trivia!
+1
Stop. This game ain't close to over.
The Alabama radio shows Saban at all times, and he''s pretty tiny, so yes actually 
REALLY excited about that 10 year contract with ESPN. 
It's so hard to get really into the game with all of these commercials
No
I won't live if it doesn't 
20-10 uga
how fucking late is your stream
Those iphone commercials are just galling. It's like they are exclusively trying to market and sell to kids in high school and girls who are less than five years removed from being in a sorority.Meanwhile regular adults like me just wanted a better battery.
That Bama player throwing punches was crazy, but it pales in comparison to the time when Alfred the Great lead a West Saxon army to repel an invasion by Danelaw Vikings this day in 871
I am so fucking sick of iPhone commercials
what is with your flair?
DID SOMEONE ORDER A PIZZA BALL???
If Saban has walked over and told 48 to get the fuck off his sideline, I would have required a doctors care for my erection. 
thank ya
6, but I took a nap until the 2nd quarter
I willing to bet that the winning locker room is going to be loaded with Waffle House.
It's clear as day that Michel and Swift need to run the ballI love Chubb but he's too slow for this game. 
Yes. Yes he did
He forgot to pray to ask to remember them 
They should have had the 4 spot.
Think Tyrod Taylor
I worded it badly, I meant that the team itself gets funded, I doubt the boosters would put any money into football players themselves when basketball is more pertinent for that lol.
Isn't it true that The Beatles song Michel Ma Belle was written about Sony Michel?
Fuck these NBA primetime commercials, so annoying
Well his name is Richard, but we call him Dick. Dick Chubb
Thanks
Shitty Wok
I wish Tebow would stop making so many commercials. He reminds me of when Florida used to be good at football.
Nah 
Dilly dilly
Commercials....... For goodness sake
If georgia hangs on, at least auburn didn't get it. 
Its 2018, are we still pretending Tebows straight?
All these commercials but where is my homeboy the rapping teacher?
It really sucks this is the last game of the season. Going to miss CFB
[LOOK AT ME..](https://i.imgur.com/OsVYceW.png)
I too, feel your pain.
Run you silver britches!
trying to make Jalen a passing QB
Christians are stupid. 
I never get those. Is that an AT&T commercial or an Apple Commercial?
I hate agreeing with you
Thanks
id like to start the motion to bring jalen hurts to aggieland
His middle name is Withyer.  Nick-a-lass Withyer Chubb.
You're right. I got my numbers confused, considering one is a DB I should of known better hehe
Solution: See Michel out there more?I think I will see more good plays
Might be one of the more underrated players from what I've seen.
Happiness is for champions
He's telling them to bring their own guts 
Wow that's ugly still a good doggo tho
Adorable 
i think both teams realize that they can't win the game of life so aren't trying as hard.
I''d say yall are fine. We don''t have Brady 
HE wEnT to uF hE cANt bE sTUpiD
Big missed pass interference, missed face mask as well. All big drive killers. 
Moved to the other end of the couch and changed Bama shirts.
Thought I saw him shove a female staffer on his way to the bench. I hope I am wrong for his sake.
Nothing is rainbows and puppies. Might as well make a difference somewhere along the line. 
Eh...I think they'll make a push at the end. No way they go down without fighting. 
Jake fromm reminds me of tebow
TOO SOON
For which team? 
Not really stereotyping as much as statistics. 
Are these duck sized elephants?
Just watching foosball, drinking some alcohols
Thanks
If 48 was driving that Tim Tebow car, he would have smashed the elephant!!
U-C-F, FO, FO, FO, FOR LYFE. JUST TOO SWEEEET!
Michel is turning even the bad plays into good ones, running like a maniac, Chubb's just schlubbing around like this is a pickup game.
Magic City boi
Ugh, still no explanation for the Miami blowout though.
Not true this is the fourth game and we are 2/3
None of them are old enough, yet.
Did Vontaze Burfict play for Alabama? ^^^^/s
Anybody have a gif of Brown taking a swing at that coach?EDIT: Found in the GIF threadhttps://twitter.com/wonderousatx/status/950578700201885696
Don't really understand why Chubb continues to get the ball.
Why did they torture that beautiful poodle
Bama got them big boys up front
FUCK BAMA
Honda Accord says hi...it's a never ending quest.
Are you at a bar in Idaho with Bama and UCF fans? 
That's what she was sayin if Bama wins she was gonna give me a bj an if they win I gotta give her a bj but lol it's a chick I think thats just the way she was talkin. 
Michel has looked so much better than Chubb today I'd be sticking with him as much as possible
Based upon what I'm seeing of these teams, I think it is pretty obvious that UCF would likely beat either of them.
she's like every race and face type put together, apples going for everything
I went to the bathroom shortly after that little tiff with #48 and came back to the guy passed out. I was hoping it was the same guy and Saban straight jacked him in the face.
Poor thing 
I'm a teacher. I did two tours in Iraq, too. Iraq was easier 
half chubb, if you will
You mean like Bosa? DAE Bosa babies?
I heard he just had to poop really bad so he was doing anything to get back into the locker room
You can fuck right off with these commercial breaks ESPN
Is BAMA band playing "The End" by Linkin Park? 
Look down, look down, don't look him in the eye!
Nah dude, he knew they''d be getting a new one in a few days.
Uga''s defense has been stupid all game besides that one drive when they were just behind the 8ball. Felt like an nba game when elite offenses just go on a run and you need a timeout 
Maybe make a man miss.
What?
Thanks
Go Bulls!
You picked the wrong bar obviously... 
It would've been downed further inside the 20.
Why does apple always advertise their gimmicks instead of actually useful features? Ok, I know why but it's still annoying. 
Maybe y'all should want Bama to win. Every national championship loss is another year Saban will come back and try again ... 
I'm confused about benching Hurts
The voice, the Jesus facade etc. 
They ain't played nobody PAAAAWWWLLL!!!
I mean I hope they would have been rattled when they were losing to Auburn in the 4th quarter and that wasn't that long ago. This one is  higher stakes but it's not like the iron bowl was a joke. Wasn't that long ago
Georgia has a chance to win this with Defense. Make Alabama drive down slowly and come up with the stops. You should have enough points if your Defense plays well.
I got some bad news for you 
They can still run the play with 5 seconds on the clock instead of 15.
No I mean 3rd. 
Fuck Bama. Dirty plays, fighting amongst themselves...But I hope the player who collapsed is ok! Thank goodness he was awake and alert before leaving.
I believe Kiffin leaving was official before Bama won their semifinal last year.
How nice for them to get a taste of their own medicine
As an avid lip reader here is the gist of what they said:Coach: "your play this game has been subpar"Player: "I strongly disagree"
This game really favors the freshmen.  It gets older, they stay the same age.
defense please!
It''s just a 10 point game but Georgia has clearly been the better team  so far 
"Yeah, this is my son Richard..."
They were running Michel hard and have him a 2 play breather. That was all it took
I think we hit the 3 hour mark.... And only 12 minutes left in the 4th
Hurts coming back?
Cheers
FUCK CLEMSONOh - whoops
BUCK FAMA
They say 48 is still out there somewhere to this day trying to fight Nick Saban
So what's going on on tv when ESPN plays the commercial break screen on stream? Local commercials?
[removed]
No take backs!!
I agree that there have been terrible calls but that doesn't answer my question. Why would they do it? What's the motive? 
I will not buy an iPhone until it has a butthole recognizer
if bama dont score on this drive..the game is literally over...
I''m not one of those delusional UCF fans, but Georgia vs UCF or Oklahoma would''ve been way better as a National Championship Game.
I actually really like that commercial.To each their own
it's fucking insane
If you ugly that's going to cost extra
I-O!
As a buckeyes fan from Pittsburgh, go dawgs
Gotta respect their strategy of finding the most iterating indie pop song possible time and time again. 
The one with the weird bangs right?? That face makes me want to scoop my own eyes out. 
inb4 "refs"
Good game UCF money in the bank challenge. 
Number 48 swung on a player in the game and got a penalty. Coaches took him out and he swung his helmet at another coach after Saben got on his ass.
It's been 10 minutes without something happening on Bama's sideline. Must be preparing for a grand finale... maybe Saban will pull a Joe Pa and shit his pants.
Only way to get our life back from SEC playoff addiction
That happened in the NFL playoffs yesterday- he signaled for fair catch, let it bounce and then tried to run. The refs signaled him down. 
YAWK
 Go cocks!
I hope Mehki Brown is off the team. He should have been ejected from the game, but his sideline actions should have him cut from the team. If Saban keeps him, i will have absolutely no respect for him as a coach.
C'mon refs. You got one more in you. 
https://youtu.be/nsZi1fCwS8Q
It looks bad but he just reached for him it's not like he took a swing at him. Did look like he was ready to Sprewell him though.
You ever lived in Alabama bro?
I would say they are borderline strange looking.
You know how I be
"your phone dies at 52%? Fuck you we want you to having singing unicorn emoji and the ability to unlock the phone with a ten year old photo."
We felt it in 2014! Go dawgs!
...
Good bot.
I have a feeling this defensive grind will turn into a shootout for the last 10 minutes
Mekhi Brown is an idiot. Wtf was that. 
He's got a button on his desk in his office that closes and locks the door...
Yeah idk why they don't just use Michel to shove it down Bama's throat every play. I'm glad they're not, but they should. 
Yes
Peloton--> Black Mirror Season 1 Episode 2
Michel averaging over 7 yards a carry, he looks real good tonight. Shifty, runs with power and sees holes opening up nicely. I could see an NFL team getting great value on him in the draft.
Yeah we also should have got a face mask on us earlier too. Pretty embarrassing. 
They're all playing for their lives... I'm not surprised one cracks up and takes a swing at a coach
He has almost certainly killed one of them at some point.
We're not watching golf?!
i mean it's not like he could do any worse right
Here's to hoping that Alabama becomes the new 90s Buffalo Bills in the Superbowl.Show up and lose every year.
What can I do to help?
At least you tried bot
Thanks ESPN
Ayyyy we can be co-lessor-champs to uga 
I think they're one of those teams where it's impossible to feel like it's already a done game.
DO YOU WANNA MEET ME IN THE LOUNGE?
Thanks that's what we needed haha
True story 
I''m so sick and fucking tired of the photoshop.

Yea :(
Considered being a teacher, salary and benefits not competitive enough for all the BS put up with. 
INJECT DIES IRAE INTO MY VEINS!!!
What do you think Nick Saban is like to play Monopoly against?
You and me both
[deleted]
Georgia/UCF combine to make... UCGEORGIAF
End of game must be a hell of a lot cheaper--I've seen a few local ads the last couple of rounds.
If you''re using the WatchESPN app, try a different stream. I''ve only had 1 commercial this entire game with the command stream 
5 for each of the P5 conference champs, one G5, and two at large?
On the bright side you get summers off
Is he back in? I missed it 
He'll be playing for #thefaU
haha me either, I don't know if I could hang like I used too.  Bitches love Pauley's. I had a good ass time the week I was there 3 years ago or so. Moonshine bar, 9d's (lmao hell of a place to end the night) Flanagans?So many more , oh and that one strip club....don't remember the name.. so fun.
That commercial about credit card interest needs to be seen by all the fans at this game that couldn''t really afford their tickets.
Bama fans at the top level of this bar are spilling beer on the Georgia fans on the bottom level of the bar. 
Why don't the students have any taco Bell?
It's so bad. It picks the worst times to fuck up.
The facial recognition technology is not that cool to me, apple is trying to act like we all asked for that.. all we asked for is a longer lasting battery  
ESPN is hurting for advertisers
He's amazing. Best QB prospect Bama has ever had. He's making some mistakes because its his first serious playtime and in the goddamn title game against a good defense, but he's going to be incredible
And LeVeon Bell
A SOS of 100 does.
yes of course, even some of his players feel weird if a day goes by and he doesnt give one.
Who the fuck would want to watch "The Worst Cooks In America"?
Is Mekhi Brown still alive or has he been processed yet?
Am I the only one who doesn't see Alabama coming back?
That coach is leaving. If I had to guess, that was months in the making.No excuse for the player though. 
I'll always hate Iowa more than I hate you, just know that. 
Someone on that ad firm has a freckle fetish
He did forget the middle finger power move to force a camera cut, but agreed.
You call fair catch in the air.  If it hits the ground before you call for a fair catch, then it doesn't qualify as a fair catch and you can pick it up and run with it.
Then I'd say nah unless they're life long fans of one of the teams
 No, Espn, the app doesn''t choose me. I just downloaded this piece of shit because it''s the only option out there. 
Oh yis
They try way too hard to be ~swaggy~
Well....1/3 of Alabama is classified as Obese so....
I'm still proud, but I wish he'd chill out a bit. That'd be okay 
Nope
CBS streaming on ESPN
Fucking football game ruining my hard-earned and eagerly awaited commercials.
Oh no, why would you bring that up now?
It doesn't even matter
Pick a flair! Holy shit I almost threw up!
He's also not the starting LT
Hahah you Falcons fans will never recover from that.I hope you beat Gump though
Personally, he just makes me cringe on tv. Great football player, not the best tv personality.
Well, if he's pretending, then we kinda have to.
I know Kirby is a UGA Alum and is building what is looking like a team for the next few years, but how much money do you think Bama would throw at him if Saban left?I don''t think he''d leave or that Georgia wouldn''t match it, but he I''m sure they''d offer a huge amount.
What pay?
If that's your sister's name, I already had her.
I wonder how many croots Kirby promised a championship to? That always works. 
Chaos is our lord. Georgia is his disciple. 
ESPN Game Center has a video 
worst feeling
DAWGS FANS WILL BARK AT Y'ALL!!!\#BESTFANS
Defense
Ruined Cleveland's big ass
As someone who taught, the teacher ad reminds me of something I noticed.If they have to convince you to take the job, you might not want that job
I want this one to end........
What''s with the ambulance chasing commercial from the ‘90''s?
Najee, yes
I gotta believe that's gonna be a red flag on draft day
Introducing them to the reptilian overlords Saban can trace his lineage to
Yup
Sadly missed most of the game. Why is Hurts on the bench? I assume for lack of production.
Yes ESPN, let''s compare this game to one that occurred 5 years ago 
*former Alabama player Brown.
Yes
So did Sumlin really get/take the Arizona job? He probably would have been looking at his phone more than he is in the coaches' stream
Unrelated but this is just badass.:https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/tom-bradys-first-post-on-social-media-since-patriots-tension-story-i-am-the-storm/
GO DAWGS!
They're all over watchESPN even NFL games
take your upvote
Post game thread bud
Too soon 
They thought they would be winning at this point
The refs took over the first half of the 3rd quarter.
oh he loves it and the attention it gives him
Nah forreal shit was hilarious
This is looking way too similar to 2012 to turn out well for Georgia 
DON'T PUT THAT EVIL ON GEORGIA
Do you want to get shit on by kids, parents and bosses for $20k a year and pay out of pocket for supplies? Be a teacher.  Thankless job that deserves better pay.
Also why I've considered moving to the west coast... This game wouldve started at 5pm 
Less fun fact: there's not nearly as much of it here as there is in Georgia. Also, zero evidence of this ever happening. 
Calling a Tua turnover on this drive.
I hope so goat of songs. 
"They call it the remainder that's the number that remains"Forever the hottest line of 2017
Michel has been running like he has nothing to lose. Chubb has been hesitant. 
It would be cool if watch espn was showing the game instead of this odd white circle swirly thing.
Oh lord, how could you guys not get a better starter? Don't you always have the best recruiting classes?
*dominant2 ez
Lmao did they just jinx the dawgs?
C'mon dawgs
I only trust my own two eyes for that
Someone's getting some grits
Next week he''ll be in a Auburn uniform so he''s got that going for him
Tbh Lee Corso doomed us from the start
ESPN fuck off, i don't need to see that stat
 watchespn literally skips during the play but shows the huddles seamlessly every time
Nearly every girl ithat Apple uses in their ads affects me like that. 
Neutrals rooting for bama: who hurt you?
I wonder how someone decides they wanna try to be an Olympic bobsledder. Like how does one get into that as a kid lol 
#Go Gators
Lets go Najee
We are all true freshmen tonight.
Who the fuck does he think he is?
Ohhhhhh
Damn. Was he playing at all?
www.twitter.com/benreiter/status/907934854297346048This will get buried but deserves to be posted here
FRESHMANDRINK
freshman are taking over
Ha I thought same thing
Bruh don''t be dissing'' Justin Timberlake like that.
How do you know yet?
A WILD NUMBER 1 RECRUIT APPEARS
Do the opposite. Ask him why he didn''t invite y''all to the bar 
Bama's defense is physical enough to deal with Chubb, he bullies smaller defenses in a way that Sony can't 
Birmingham/Central AL is actually a huge market for CFB. ESPN loves the ham.
Inb4 Bama touchdown 
This is fun
Wtf... Why are Rachel Nichols and the blond lady playing beer pong right now?
2012 SECCG callback? I like this fun fact. 
Whoa...Oh. Rapper. Thank God.
yeah that was bad, that should have been a flag. i got mixed up :)
I bet Atlanta is gonna be one big bang fest tonight
So sad we didn''t get Najee
Who needs upperclassmen, anyway?
Damn it Dawgs you gotta make those tackles. 
I was making a joke in that Kiffin was hired out before the game and Pruitt is this year. 
If I hear the word freshman one more fucking time
Just put all freshmen on the field already 
Facemask no call 
Run those boys dowwwwwwwn
TRUE FRESHMAN DRINK
this made me lol irl
Ugh. The Steelers Buckeye fan, huh?
Catch-22, you can't
What was up with that fight on Bama's sideline??  
Poll: Have you Bama faithful forgot about the missed FG yet?
About time Najee got some snaps.
/r/fakehistoryporn 
We can stop the list after Clemson and Georgia
If Tebow has Fromms arm he''s still be in the NFL
FUCK IT. Put all the true freshman in!
RING THE KING.  PIZZA KING.
True freshman!
FRESHMANRESHMAN
freshmen over here, freshmen over there
Next year AP poll1. UGA2. Miami3. UCF4. U of Texas5. Bamma6. Clemson
F R E S H M E N G A M E
how is that different from your face?
do you wanna meet me in da club?
The Bama side is fights, fainting and fuckery
Pls pull a Falcons
Yes
It was his dream man, don't criticize him for having dreams!
"FUCK IT PUT IN ALL THE FRESHMAN!!"
How much does Najae normally play for Bama? Haven't really seen him whenever I've watched them
Got class, I have to be up at 9 so not too bad.
I see Apple finally took off that shitty "what's a computer" commerical
BOO NAJEE BOOOOOO
This was a good comment
I'd put my money on Chickfila.
We know
No bias they just made some pretty poor calls that got Bama back in it. You all are playing games great this half though aside from the 80 us bomb play
What is it with Bama running backs and dreadlocks 
An all freshman affair 
**CYCLONE**
Take a Shot every time they say "True Freshman"
HOT TAKE: Alabama and Georgia have played in the past!
What are they feeding kids these days good lord
Someone give me gold!
Lol not really that's a bit dramatic they are down by 10 not 20
Agreed, so glad I switched to that channel
Thanks
Stealing u/shittymorphs gimmick. Bold move Cotton
IS THAT?!IS IT?!BAAAH GOD THAT'S UCF'S MUSIC!SCOTT FROST HAS JUST THROWN NICK SABAN THROUGH A TABLE ON THE SIDELINE AND UCF IS TAKING THE FIELD ON OFFENSE AGAINST GEORGIA! 
FRESHMAN FRESHMAN FRESHMAN FRESHMAN 
Don''t call it yet
 Kirk is loving all these true freshmen!
College football streams fucking suck.  Will be so glad when this shit is done
I feel like I need a shower after that commercial
Yep
It will be an absolute tragedy if Jake Fromm doesn't get with State Farm to advertise after college football
I appreciate your principled attitude toward this
Damnit, now I can't enjoy it any further on account of your recognition of this historical fact.
Not the worst thing joe pa did
Good news for the Cleveland Browns...If Rosen or Darnold don't work out, they've got Jake Fromm to look forward to for sure.
That would probably still recognize your face...
I couldn't stand the shit quality anymore 
I go back to Funnyman Jermaine and wish I could watch them both lose at times like this (Aub-LSU 2016)
This game is pretty good in my opinion 
When they don't win? Yes. His team starts freaking out
IT'S THE YEAR OF THE FRESHMEN, BOYS
Thanks
Fuck your stat ESPN. 
It's the High School All-American bowl
That poor poor doggie
Fucking Harvard...
You know this is the way it has to be.
Oh god don't remind us ESPN
Got dam. Whisky.
Scrotum identifier.
I'd really just rather not have my face scanned and logged into some biometric database, thanks. 
found Bill Walton's reddit account. Why do you have TCU flair tho?
Bama mafia would be fucking scary 
It was #48 Mekhi Brown who plays for Alabama, not Georgia.
Portland.
I fuckin love mb me an my bros talkin bout movin there an startin a vape shop
Good ratings per capita but only a midsize market
I had a Motorola replacement phone in 2013 that had facial recognition.  Apple gets it in 2017 and the world loses it.  
I want to know too. That song so catchy tho
Saban must be getting nervous. Just shoving raw talent into the game now 
You've gotta love freshman huh?
rocke'dem
No worries thanks anyway :)
Someone please clarify, are there freshmen in this game?
someone please throw a punch im about to snore
Yes
Is this the same timeline that the Patriots fire Belichick and hire Hugh Freeze?
Yeah I fucking Love Brady. 
I CANT KEEP UP WITH REDDIT LIVE
He seems like a stable genius.
For a lot of teachers, that's two months of unpaid time
ThatsTheJoke.jpg
Jebus, that hit
Man, these freshman are awesome, the future is bright for them!
That's a big boi
Omg they should send somebody into the booth and tell the guys they are really overkilling the freshman narrative. It's getting annoying
I like how it reminds me of that time he beat the Steelers in the playoffs by sucking so badly he won.  
They are advertising their "neighborhoodofgood" service. Which is their search engine thing that lets you search for community needs that you're interested in taking part in.  Yeah, they're also advertising themselves, but I think it's a net positive
Pretty much, yes.
You left out Wisconsin 
Oh my Lord that hit
layin the wood yo
If Bama wins are they just gonna start playing like the 92 Knicks in every game from now on
Just as dirty as their players?
Yeah, done absolutely nothing in the first half.
I would not like to get hit by that dude
Thompson knocked his ass out
The battery on the new phone isn't bad
Laid him OUT
If Georgia loses this then that confirms that Georgia teams are doomed forever. 
So when are they bringing out the High School Seniors?
BAH GAWD
F R E S H M E NRESHMEN
Until next year when they revolutionize animoji
SPEAR BY GOLDBERG
[deleted]
#DAMN
Tackling has been horrible for UGA the past few drives
Oh shit, that's a hit
watch Alabama win
Bama isn't that far but yeah ATL folks have good reason to stubhub 
Dawgs: I just took my contacts out because I'm tired. I hope this doesn't fuck up yalls juju
All around fun play right there
The cool room megacast is just awkward 
Can we play the heel like Samoa Joe?
What the fuck is up with the Bama player swinging at his coaches. Dude cost himself a spot on a constant national contender over two actions in a 90 second span. Crazy. 
Jesus that HIT
I'd rather not get hit by 78
Alright alright alright
All freshmen all the time.
SsssStttaaahhhhpppp
Somebody check that man for a pulse
Damn. Talk about spinning right into a dump truck. 
78 killed 17 omg
holy fuck ow
UGA needs to force a turnover and out in one more TD quick here 
Freshman
I can smell the CTE on that hit from here
Holy shit how'd he get up?
ESPNEWS coach's room has the best view. I want to watch every game like this
HOLY SHIT WHAT A STIFF ARMAND A TACKLE.
https://twitter.com/sds/status/950580521578500096
17 just got fucking leveled haha
Big man destroyed his ass
What a hit
That waas a scary hit. Damn
"Great play by the offensive line, ~~holding~~ blocking their guys."
Does anyone else think the Alabama running back should have just kept running instead of juking.
Georgia needs to counter all these freshman for Alabama by calling up some local high school seniors real quick 
I hope we get nothing but punts for the rest of the game. 
Are you high?
Tua throws such a beautiful ball.Like it literally looks perfect
no. 17 almost road kill there
NOBODY TELL HIM! 
I believe so
BOOM
GOREGOREGORE
He got fking rekt
Man, what a hit
Don't forget their classic "All You Need Is Chubb"
BEST TWAMS OF COLLEGE FOOTBALL
ESPN: THERE'S FRESHMEN RUNNING ALL OVER THE PLACE DOWN THERE! THEY'VE GONE WILD!....wait that didn't come out right.
78 looks like a man you don''t want to mess with 
What is shit through a tin horn that''s a new one
Hey this might sound crazy but can Alabama run the ball more
Correct. They were scoreless going Into halftime.
Oh man, if Georgia chokes this away I just thought of a great "night the lights went out in Georgia" joke. Now I'm torn. 
Good play but holy cow 78 almost decapitated him. 
Fucking beautiful tackle 
That Man Has a Family 
nice pop
Teacher here, front office BS is infinitely worse than any BS your students give you...I tell my kids all the time the actual teaching part is the most enjoyable aspect of my job
THAT is a hit
Boy what a hit 
Murdaaaa
Looks like Last Chance U just got a new transfer!
You keep getting older but the freshmen stay the same age
Good.
God damn that was like getting hit by a truck 
fuck replay was killer on that
Let's just put in a high schooler at this point 
Big hit
Eat em up, Thompson!
http://www.totalprosports.com/2018/01/08/alabama-lb-mekhi-brown-punches-georgia-player-then-erupts-on-sidelines-at-coaching-staff-video/
Jesus, dude got hit by a bus
Holy shit, he's chewing on his own teeth right now
Those men are fresh 
Textbook example of laying the fucking wood.
Yeah that commercial pissed me off. I didn''t stop teaching because I didn''t realize the impact I could have, I stopped teaching because the pay was shit and parents are terrible.
It's a rebuilding year
That hit, man. That hit. 
Beastly 
Ow.
Damn son
That hurt to watch 
But I don't wanna die yet
oh, it could happen! I'm so nervous
I got a lot of enjoyment from this bot
Y'all better watch out. Tua and Najee Harris is fucking everyone's mothers, girlfriends, and fathers next year
Did anyone get the plate number of that battleship that just ran that poor man over?
Hell of a hit by 18. 
you actually think bama is gonna be ranked lower than second.
That's like an 18 wheeler hitting a fiat. Holy shit. 
Fucking rocked.
This is the first time in a long time I''ve felt myself pulling for Alabama. Partly because I want this to come down to the wire and partly because I made a lunch bet at work today.
And grading papers while watching the National Championship Game. 
 Damn that was a big hit
Dude got fucking smaaacked
Damn
Kabooom
That''s a great concept, I''d watch that
Amidst all this animosity, I'd like to take a moment to say I fucking love Da'Ron Payne
God damn 17 got destroyed
Tua throws a gorgeous spiral 
We have families man.
That would be the best time line
He is a good hire. Drew Lock sure loved him and he has thrived under him. If he had stayed with us, I would have thought Lock was going to be staying for his senior season. Now it is up in the air and we went for a less than desirable hire to replace him. You guys done good.
I really need a Karate Kid marathon in my life soon. Not quite sure why that has occurred to me. 
That was nasty
BAH GAWD JR
That was a big boy hit
I just realized Chick Fil A is making extreme bank tonight
Omg how did he get up 
How did he find a space there?
lol ohio state would CRUSH both these teams
Yeah roll my ass right off the field 
Nice? I don't want him to get beat up. 
Nice hit. 
#78 SCARES ME
Wheels on the bus go BOOM!
Daaaaaaaaaamn
Is rolling still a thing?  I had a blast being a frattastic asshole back in the day, but that was 20 years ago.  I always enjoyed the dawn in the fountain thing too 
Explains a lot 
alabama is an inside job
That hit was just straight nasty right there!
Dear lord
Did number 48 have a mental breakdown? First attacking an opposing player and then attacking his own coach? Doubt he plays at Alabama ever again. 
We are literally playing freshmen, and playing better. 
We need censorship for this
Hit
Instructions perfectly clear: died of alcohol poisoning 
Fucking hell that tackle
Yall got any... freshman?
I''m drinking crown royal
Trent "Blood-Pressure Cuffs" Thompson.
how are you Alabama and have to play a freshman at QB and RB for the championship game? 
5 hour CFB games are my happy place. 
gotta get up at like 7:45, long enough to make my coffee and walk down to my computer by 8AM.
Geeze what a hit!
this will come down to the final drive
Taco Bell paid for 500 tickets for each student section.
Honestly I''m not sure, but considering this is the true freshman game starring true freshman and featuring special guest star true freshman, it''s possible.
17 might need to go sit down for a little bit
The crawl lol
On the bad side, we look bad..on the bitter sweet side, Georgia would be the 5th SEC team to win the natty in 11 years
This is a recipe for disaster for georgia. Playing deep allows bama to run screens and build up speed
Hello police?  I''d like to report a murder.
Dis game good
That was almost a fumble on that hit too.
Thompson lit him up on that tackle 
Mobile has the Senior Bowl, Atlanta has the Freshman Bowl.
Big ups. 
Holy fuck
that's some r/dogberg material. 
:(
/r/nocontext
Touché 
BIG BOY
GOOOOOOLDBERG
Bill Belichick approves. 
The salt would be amazing but please no
Jesus fuck this is WWE. Y'all called it r/CFB lol
There was only one El Tractorcito mi amigo
Bama's kinda runnin the Auburn offense right now
NCAA 2005 Update: On the first offensive play, my QB for the Gators overthrew the receiver badly and as a result Arkansas intercepted it and will begin again at their own 15 yard line with 4:02 to go in the 1st. Score 0-0
2 tru
Is 2 Chainz on the Bama sideline? 
12
I hear Stanford has one of the best bands in the country 
Right, my bad
dude jumped up like it wasn't shit.  that's what's impressive
I wish they'd stop showing sad Jalen on the sideline.It hurts.
[deleted]
helluva tackle
Maybe... *too* perfect
It looks bad because it's bad 
Seriously though, this must be a record for number of different freshman in on a play in a championship game
Saban says fuck it, let''s play all the freshman 
Why is Bamas starting quarterback out?
Good fucking lord that hit
My god
"PUT THE CHEERLEADERS IN!!!"
Then why'd you bet it? 
What a violent hit 
Holy shit.
I heard he once ran with scissors
lol did the ref signal that it was ga's ball
I'll admit that neither offense is stellar, but the greatest thong about this game is each team's defense by far.
Thank you sir
my man laid the wood my goodness
BIG BOY HITS
Alabama is scoring on this drive for sure. They have it.
You know what I like about these freshmen?
Guinness extra stout. It's all I had left
Big hits really suck to watch now a days, all you can think about is the poor kids brain. Used to be one of my favorite plays just 5 years ago 
78 tryna send people to the shadow realm.
i just dont understand, it takes 4 people to takcle a bama back...
On the plus side, no more shitty iPhone commercials
Dude, share!
oof ouch owie my freshman
Ooooooh shiiiiit
I'd watch it.
RIP in peace
Big Baller Hit
Concussion 
Well, that was the most vicious totally clean hit I''ve seen in a while.
What a man getting up from that holy shit what a hit
“It''s Jake Fromm State Farm.”
He can walk back to Tuscaloosa for all I care. No room for that on this team. 
I think #78 is the last guy I'd want to get hit by tbh
78 flexing lmao
BOOM
That hit registered on the Richter Scale.
Screen their way downtown
Auburn'll take 'em.
17 doesn''t know it yet, but that hit killed him
Ouch. My bones hurt just from watching that hit
Pretty much - Bama couldn''t get anything going offensively in the first half
Did bama and Georgia sign a pact to only play freshman to make the rest of the world shit their pants as their future flashes before their eyes?
RIP
really impressed by TUA
This game is 1000 X better on ESPNEWS'' Film Room with Sumlin, Gundy, and all commenting 
Legit excuse. Thanks for your contribution. 
Wtf
Are the Georgians cancelling work tomorrow?
TRUE FRESHMAN DRINK
Current score.Alabama - 10 UCF - 13-0
He's going to feel that tomorrow, ouch
Trenton Thompson doesn't get to lay bricks often, so he makes good use of his time.
https://twitter.com/Deadspin/status/950578313302601728?s=17
Did you guys know that Jalen Hurts is 25-2 as a starter? 
Big Man Tackle
#OH SHIT THAT HURDLE.
What about a starfish/not starfish feature?
*runs alongside tracks trying to match speed*
it's like the story of Samson my dude. That's where they draw their strength from.
Go cocks!
nice hit
Holy shit, now that's a lick.
He ded
I want a gif of that
Correct
Fuck
Did somebody say defensive battle?
Got benched
Man how the fuck do players hold on to the ball after hits like that?  Football is crazy 
Uhhhhhhhhhhhh Texas is no where close to top 10.
FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK 
And that, kids, is how you break your corpus collosum
Yeah, shoulda seen him in the spring game, was beautiful 
Running game development 
Not a gif but https://mobile.twitter.com/Claudio_GSN/status/950578249888882688
The low crawl after that hit was awesome.
That tackle is what getting hit by a truck looks like. 
horrible tackling by G
We got a true freshman circus going on
Georgia? More like what the fuck happened to the defense 
Big ass hit but he had his head down bad. Kind of tackle where a bugger guy could seriously hurt himself. Edit: not sure why I'm being downvoted, I'm not advocating for a penalty I'm saying the dude was chin to chest tackling. He hits a big guy and he snaps his spine. 
You can have all the national championships you want as long as you remember that we were bulldogs first
Dat hit
NAJEE HARRIS
I bet you could beat Jordan 1-on-1....EDIT: nice secondary flair
I hate Alabama more than I hate the Pats
STOP PLAYING THE SAME SONG
I think every team should have a grad assistant with a dunce hat that players have to wear after they get a personal foul. Basically the opposite of a turnover charm.
Najee Harris is a monster
This just in bama is still in this game
Surprised that dude could stand up after getting hit by that giant ass human being.
Georgia pls
Alabama''s RB depth is absolutely amazing 
move to the skycam - no announcers just play
TY
FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUTTTTTTTTTTTTTUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRREEEEEEEEEEE
True freshman drink
NERVOUS
ok this 22 is good
Fuck all the not true freshman.
You gotta feel for Hurts, man. 
FUCK
JUDGE JEUDY WITH THE BLOCK
Shit Bama gonna win?
The interior aesthetics suck
Please don't blow this Georgia.
Drink every time you hear "freshman"
Why do they lock the thread after each quarter?
Coach: I bet you wont throw a punch at me during the national championship and jeopardize your careerPlayer: quicksaving...
What a fucking brick of a man laying a shot on a WR that far of the LoS
These bama freshman 
We've established that Hurts has a good record, so please stop talking about it.
Alabama needs points on this drive
Great bounce
Ate it 3 hours ago :/.  Meager rations for the peasants
big fuck
Georgia cmon 
when in doubt use your 5 star freshman
Is that Derrick Henry or...?
oof ouch owie
He's ass my dude
As I said...
hahahahahahahahaha
ESPN is already getting ready to suck Tua's dick for next year.
17 regrets making the first guys miss. 
F R E S H M A N N
GOOD GRACIOUS
we got a ball game kiddies 
Where'd Josh Jacobs go? Did he get buried on the depth chart?
Game shouldn't even be close 
Too bad Najee Harris didn''t come to Michigan, sorry Georgia 
Y''all got anymore of them Freshman 
/r/freshmanhurtingjuice
I boil it, dip it in ranch, and eat it. 
Saban may want to consider putting Hurts back in. They need to keep their relationship good if things get dicey, kinda like how Louis XII of France got to marry Anne of Brittany in accordance with a law set by his predecessor, Charles VIII this very day in 1499
Saban gonna start just playing freshmen from now on
Ominous
I say it again I love this freshman class
Bama breaking out the kids
Roquan loves him some late hits
Wrong account?
Besides like the first season 
Okay?
Goodbye, childhood memories
22sp00ky4me
Illegal formation 
wew that hit by 78 is what that dude LIVES for
Saban gonna win with highschoolers next year
Georgia gunna shit this one arent they
Blatant holding
Who the fuck is this guy!?
Come on now Georgia. Don't you start with this 
Damn that's a football hit right there
This game just couldn''t end quietly, huh
When did Derrick Henry go back to Bama?
Guys are the streams working yet? Been listening to the game in my car for an hour because all the streams were shit. I would like to go inside 
loved that hold on the shoulder pads
UGA don't choke this game away
Bama getting away with some serious holding tonight.
Which band is playing the show tunes? 
I have a sickness, and the only prescription is more true freshman
I wasn't aware I was watching a freshman football game 
Alabama is going to win this aren't they 
Playing poorly, no spark
LOL, added a comma to make it a little better
Return of TEH FRESHMENZ!!
The alabama true freshmen 
freshman v freshman game
Dawgs pleeeeeeeeeeaassseeeee
I had class with Cam Sims when he was recovering from his knee injury and I was so glad to see him healthy and playing. Hope he's alright.
 I thought crack backs were like targeting now? 
Fuck this is a fun game to watch
NICE HOLD
I don't know if y'all heard, but there are some true freshmen playing tonight.
that was a hit 
here comes bama.
Man if I''m UGA I''m shitting bricks 
Very *nifty*
My gollyNajee Harris is a baby Henry
Nice run but also nice hole by the bama o line 
Georgia is Georging 
OH GOD THEY'RE GETTING HOT
Maybe we shouldn''t be redshirting all these freshmen
Holding obvious
That slow-mo hit was so nice.
Yet another egregious hold on the line on that play 
the skycam stream is good
You can always tell when people just watch Pac10 football and no NFL 
No. 
Word is Mekhi Brown was upset when he overheard his coach saying he runs the faucet over the toothpaste before brushing his teeth. Mekhi is more of a squeeze and go kinda guy.
HOLDING
Falcons Super Bowl flashbacks..
NAJEE
Haha heyyyyyyy
*JESUS CHRIST ANOTHER FRESHMAN??*
The bama dynasty is clearly not over
Yeah they really glazed over a huge detail 
He hurts. 
Yea it didn't last long, it's back to crap
Bit (a lot) of holding there
This is a "go through a whole can" kinda game.
I fucking love freshmen 
LOOK AT ALL THESE FRESH BOIS!
Oof
where's our defense??
that's a fucking hold!
Why have they never used Najee? He was always ridiculous in those high school mixtapes you'd see on Facebook a couple years ago
You guys never were very good at following directions, or play calling, or counting, or anything really...
I just don't trust anything that insurance companies do
This is good hard hitting ball right here
Mised another hold there and Alabam is in business
Glad I have more beer
Lol I love it.
Nah I'm watching it on an actual TV like a pleb
Alabama is down 10 with almost a full quarter to go and we have people posting threads calling for Saban''s retirement lmao delete your account man
how are all these 30 year old men getting freshman status
Word on the street is Kirby didn't even speak to his players at halftime. Just put on the 4th quarter of last year's Super Bowl to remind them what happens when Georgia teams get comfortable with their lead.
Damn I''m pretty impressed with 22''s vision on this drive.
Apparently benching Hurts has led to Georgia forgetting how to tackle.
Fuuuuuck!
clean being the word.  I was shocked no targeting flags went up but the replay showed it was legit.  
Don't watch football then....?
You could see the moment the soul left his body on the replay
That was the clearest uncalled holding I've ever seen 
Fucking saban rolling the dice with these player changes. He's playing with a hot hand
that's one big motherfucker.
Alabama holding not called damnit
If ESPN could get their shitty streaming fixed they would have some nice broadcasts. I love not having announcers.
Trent Thompson looks like he eats people 
South Carolina UGAOUMiamiClemsonBama
Holding ain't a penalty tonight
Can we get Hurts back? I can''t spell the back ups name. 
Man, a lot of holding going on. 
najee harristoo much mass moving too fast
I swear to God if Bama comes back I'll go play in traffic 
Hey guys it's me the freshman
We''re missing every fucking tackle. Jesus...!
So weird seeing Hurts on the sideline
Ahhh sorry. Let me see if I can find one 
wtf... aren't crack blocks a penalty....
Wow that's a lot of holding
true freshman is their weakness apparently
my insides hurt after that one
Bama will be the top team in the West at least 4-5 more years
Missed holding call
Yeah I took the under of 45 on this game so if we could just not have anymore scores that would be great 
No, no. THAT was like an 18 wheeler hitting a Fiat. 
I kinda wanna see Bama win just to see 48 be denied any part in the celebration 
Holding
STOP THE TRUE FRESHMAN
Georgia defense looking a little tired on this drive.
As a neutral fan, please give us a Bama TD to make this exciting
Tackles guys
Saban playing his 2018 team a little early I see.
Too soon
Getting held
Great holding by bama
How do you not call that hold
Apparently Hurts can't hand off the football
fumble it!!!!
RIP
Did Saban murder #48 during a commercial break? I want to hear more about that.
Next year is gonna be so good.
Both these teams are going to be dead after his game. One of the more physical games I''ve watched in a long time 
Got taken out after half time
Dead
Geeze. He's done for. National championship game and at Bama. Hope he like EMCC.
Refs missed a hold on Bama
Please please please do this Bama
I wish
Replay showed a huge hold.
I guess holding is allowed now 
You just don't get this shit in the NFL. Fuck I love this sport
Hurts bb come back
Kudos, as others have said, to the Refs. There's a bit of extra pushing/shoving/lateness in the game and they're saving us from commercials by letting them play.
I love that Alabama is sticking with the run.  This is a great game!
If the refs would call just one single hold on Bama, I''d piss myself. 
You speak the truth
That feeling when it feels like the winning team is losing...
Alabama status:[Check] In business[ ] Not in business
Tua + Jeudy + N Harris makes me so happy
You guys hear that Jalen Hurts is 25-2 as a starter?
Thanks Harvard
Pooped his pants 
Okay okay so we will get a few second place votes, but overall still control the #1 ranking
Only Alabama could have a guy like Najee Harris and not play him until the 4th Q of the last game of the season. 
Score goddammit
Pretty sad that most of bamas offense has been replaced. Freshman playing better than vets
sucks ass
ESPN steam has actually been flawless for me
Oh no, I meant regardless of what happens with this game
Are there any freshmen playing in this game?
I haven''t seen that many sideways passes since Big 10 Title game. 
bama always has three good running backs
OT
So this is how the Dawgs die, with thunderous applause 
I'm still pretty indifferent about it.  People still choose to play football.
dawgs
No opi????
Lmao i giggled.All seriousness though, both teams have played nice 3rd down defense for the most part. Big stops by both sides.
HEATHEN
*TRUE* freshmen
Throw the damn flag, he is hooking him every play..
Can we get a call
Mainly hoping for this to be an entertaining end of the game. Good football is the most fun to watch
uh he just kinda jogged around on that play lol he may be a little tired
Game is secondary
Hold...HOLD!!
amazing what the body can do while in shock. 
Call him Tua
78 WITH THE SPEAR OUT OF NO WHERE!BY GOD HE NEARLY BROKEN HIM IN HALF!
I can't even imagine the memes if another Georgia team blows a 4th quarter lead on a championship game
Will Bama have a Cardale/Barrett situation next year or will Hurts just transfer? 
NCAA 19 PS4 exclusive: Confirmed
Bama's final form is playing all of their 5* freshman.
Jalen Hurts his feelings :(
Wait wait wait......did they say Trent Thompson is freshman?!
Fuck....Alabama is really going to make a comeback aren't they?
After the offense being ineffective they benched him at halftime
Nice try 
Last Chance U
oh shit. didn't Georgia lose in that game because of clock management? 
Alabama: Our 5 stars are malfunctioning, we must put in newer models!
Georgia needs to get some pressure on the offensive line, cause they're getting pushed around 
Damn Najee, that was one of the best runs I''ve seen this game, which is saying something with Michel''s performance.
Driving hard
Benched
I can say I'm pretty happy he didn't lol
"Now to unveil my master plan: A new freshman every quarter!!  HAHA THEY'LL NEVER EXPECT IT!!"
How is Alabama''s line not getting banged for holds on every play? It''s ridiculous how much they are grabbing jersey 
[I feel like we kind of glossed over this](https://i.imgur.com/hQ50GdE.jpg)
Bama should just start running the wishbone 
Did you guys know Jalen hurts is 25 and 2 as a starter?
Dis gonna be good
What a run
Heard that.
If Alabama could fuck off with these freshman studs that would be great
Back to back mossed holds
Get off those blocks. Yo ire playing like you don't want it
I wonder if this is gonna hurt Hurts draft rating.  
TACKLE SOMEBODYYDAMMIT!!
You couldn''t find a radio stream to play inside?
It's better than the first half but I'd still stay in the car to be honest 
2 chainz no rangz
I'm no longer impressed by all these true freshman who seem to be so prevalent now. Someone needs to start a middle schooler at left tackle, that'll get my attention. 
What''s jalen hurts starting record again. I missed it the last 10 times they said it. 
Tax cuts
Did you see the georgia player touch the lineman's butt lol
Lead block was a massive hold, ok because Bama 
big 3rd down here 
Pasadena 
It's actually a decent show tbh. Lota of tips for people to learn to be serviceable cooks at home without the ominous feel of shows where its all professional chefs that are light years beyond what most people even want to do in real life
Yall got any of them 5* croots?
Gotta keep them to 3. Can't let them score a touchdown.
So crackbacks are illegal in the nfl but allowed in college? Is that right?
It aint over. 
Why did Saban bench Hurts? I just turned the game on
Kinda disappointed Jalen''s still there. Is getting to see a player storm off the field and just leave too much to ask?
close but no cigar
Man, we gotta tell all our RBs to grow their hair for next year. How are they all so good?
These freshman for Bama are doing well. Too well... 
Clearly should have had a freshman WR there Bama
so close
Whew close one
I replaced EN with SP in the URL and no lag since....like what?  It's not even a spanish stream...
This is what we need more of 
I did but only for "true freshmen"Ded now send halp 
But think of all the great H8 memes
Fuuuuuck
So refreshing. 
True 
FR
Who would winA 2 possession leadOrSome F R E S H B O I S
Are we just about to witness bama wear down uga like bama always does to everyone?
The thing with Bama is their back up's half brother mother's friend's cousin's son's daughter's friend's brother is a 5 star player and will still eat you alive.
No....no....NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO 
I''ve thought for a while now that Najee is their best ball carrier, it must be pass protection or something else that''s been limiting his playing time
The refs agree
LEGALIZE RANCH.
Anyone seen 48 on the sidelines?
How do the commentators always praise Saban but give UGA no props, lols.
I''m finding myself rooting for Bama and I don''t really know why. Am I suffering from Stockholm syndrome?
Copy paste is your friend
He was playing like hot garbage.
He just didn't work his way up the depth chart.
YOU DONT WANNA MEET ME AT THE CLUB!?!?!?
Y'all got any more of them freshman back there. Bama not going away for a while.
Missed holding on Bama? But the refs would NEVER favor bama!!!
Hey. This is exciting.
holdem here D
Jalen....Hurts?
Another missed holding call!
Jake from State Farm couldn''t provide insurance for this game 
fuck
Me too(Also a Falcons fan)
*case
New shirt. New seat. New RB.
No holding????
FRESHMEN! 
His throwing motion reminds me a lot of Tim Tebow.
Put in all the Freshman. They don't know how to handle the Freshmen
LET THE FRESHMEN RUN THE GAME
If im bama its four downs here
Yaaaaaaayyy...
why is everyone on alabama the same fucking height?
Are Atlanta sports cursed now?
best comment of the night, thank you
Tua has overthrown like 60% of his passes
4.5 SEC speed is faster than 4.5 normal speed
both teams are falling asleep
Hurts wouldn't have made that throw 
OH THAT'S A HEARTBREAK 
Bama is holding like mfers
Landon Collins just saved that cameraman from a world of hurt
I don't think there are enough teams on the sideline
I am pretty sure Alabama's third unit could make the CFP
He''ll get cut and made an example of
Hurts is not very good 
>  hol(d)e 
Would be huge if UGA can force a field goal here
Maybe putting Tua in because Georgia was practicing and scheming for their starter instead 
Future Heisman winner Najee Harris...
Stop running and throw it more.
let's go Dawgs
Were still in this bitch
So many big plays are stymied because guys downfield don't just pick a block and commit to it. It kills me to see it happen so often.
Alabama came out with the energy in the 4th
No, but did you know Calvin and Riley are brothers?
None that I have heard of
Inb4 Rose Bowl OT
That's a lot of missed holding calls
Georgia gotta lock it up soon or their gonna lose it. Alabama was playing dirty and doing badly. Don't give them this.
FUCK it  we will do it with the Freshmen.
That was a false start lol. 
Herbstreit talking about late games and how they take a toll on players. Hmm...
I too, would not be able to tackle that man.
Georgia's secondary is playing soft as fuck right now.
Bama is such a runningback factory it's crazy.
Tua can't really throw it either. 
Sabin at halftime: Just change out everyone!
He's in eighth grade. 
Who?
Georgia need to hold Bama to a FG here, or the rest of the game will get too-close-for-comfort.
Dont care who wins, i just want an entertaining finish
BAMA AINT DONE YET BOYS
Have you seen UGA's incoming class?
No, none
I love this comment beyond words
How are you supposed to keep up w this thread on live df
Bamas best strategy offensively is to just put some guy in who hasn't played this season and theyll have some chunk plays
Yikes he missed a TD on that throw
Randy?
He didnt even need to turn it over to be benched 
reported to the police
Yeah when I heard that I was really surprised. I think I just became an Alabama fan today even if you guys lose. 
CFB is now college basketball. DIAPER DANDIES ALL OVER THE PLACE BABY
I need Georgia to score 1 point to win $300. Please don't fuck me Saban. 
College Bowl games are always so exciting. I rarely get a chance to watch the regular season but I always tune into the big games.
That man is tired 
Lotta buck sweep and power you're right. 
Lol let em shit post. They just having fun
Holding is no longer a penalty. Fuck it, tackle the defenders, they aren't gonna flag it.
Appurrrrrntly, Bama just had to utilize their freshman.
I wish I would have joined the marching band at a D-I school.
Crosses gone!
Lol same, it baffles me that everyone used to think that getting your head slammed to the ground repeatedly wasn't a big health risk
Alabama is a team of professional football players that aren't being paid and still have to perform like they are. 
Fix it again Tony 
Nick Saban is the last coach I''d expect to say fuck it and put in a whole bunch of true freshman to try to win a championship
Bama''s offense is way more aesthetically pleasing with this guy at QB
What is it with Bama runningbacks and dreadlocks?
Drink every time you see a UCF would be better comment and you'll be plastered in 10 mins
B1G REFS SUCK ASS
Oh. Well in that case, I retract my outrage.
Nice
Probably not gonna play ever again for Bama
It was #48 that did that to you
Jalen Hurts to transfer to Illinois??
ESPN hometown radio stream has been solid for me all game. 
Is this the army all American game 
I'm actually rooting for BamaMay god have mercy on my soul
Does Ridley have a brother?
Disagree 
This guy throws a really pretty ball even when he misses. 
Damn Georgia what are you doing
Glad our freshman came to play
Like Stephen Curry as a sixth man
[I got u](https://mobile.twitter.com/Claudio_GSN/status/950578249888882688)
I'm telling ya Hurts not being in the game on the final Bama drive is going to cost us
I want my boy Tua to be a stud and make it to the NFL we need more lefty qb's
My favorite part is watching these young, young freshman putting their bodies all over eachother
*Alabama does a good play*“HOLDIIING REEEE” - thread
I was under the impression they could only play well for a half.
Grabbing jersey isn't holding. That's why.
Better than hurts
In the national championship game is crazy. 
22 for Bama is good, but Bama O-line in making holes this drive. 
Cmon dawgs contain them pretty please
ALabama getting away with a ton of penalties while Georgia gets flagged for Sideline celebration. Smh.
SEC SPEED
It is like the movie Soldier.
At least he throws the ball.
Welcome to big 10 reffing. 
Who needs experience? We got true freshmen!
Is Bama band playing "Headstong" by Trapt? 
Alabama vs Alabama Freshman  CFP 2019 National Championship 
Dead by second quarter
True freshman
It's just gonna be gray people on their next commercial
I gotchu fam https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlkLWxf_hEc
Do tell?
This right here.....is fucking Huge
I no longer have any confidence that Georgia will win this game
Running out of quarters...
But damn does he have a arm
Refs are missing holds but I appreciate that they aren't letting penalies decide the natty
Georgia got the fear
He is a junior
Georgia football teams and bad clock management name a better duo
We will follow your career with great interest
As a neutral I'm happy for Tua and all but damn I'm sad for Hurts right now. He has to be in pain. 
I''m sure others have commented on the same thing, but the new “live” comments as opposed to “new” on mobile is unusable
Oh Tua...you're a bit rusty. You didn't get that playtime in the Sugar Bowl like we're were told was happening. 
It's the reveries Bernard, they're causing problems
>this tempo can't be simulated in practice*PAC-12 conference erupts in laughter at Kirk Herbstreit*
He's scored 10 tho. Jalen hasn't scored this game. 
I'm saying with all the freshman doing well
For real, this was just immediately swept under the rug 
no :(
I bet saban was thrilled when he signed Johnny tsunami I heard he loves that movie
Massive holds, every play. What the fuck refs, you could at least call Alabama on sideline interference or some shit
Now is this a Must Score or Can't not score? Sabermetrics guys I need you
Jeez that's a lot of holding.
That's cool, homie. I also think the commercial does remind people to consider volunteering in general too, with or without their search engine. 
[deleted]
It's gonna hurt Hurts draft rating
Bama is gonna keep introducing a new freshman each drive. No tape on them fresh boyes
I havent watched CFB all year. The Alabama QB is atrocious.Edit: Are these flair downvotes? Angry Bama fans? Or is this guy actually good and just crapping the bed
Seriously. The fuck is going on here. 
Career=over. 
DID YOU KNOW THERE ARE TRUE FRESHMAN?
Who's a freshman? Tua?
log? talking chew.
Tua wiped the crosses from his cheeks. Hes given himself over to Saban.
How many players did Saban sacrifice to coat this RB in unholy invisible fire to make him slippery and hard to tackle?
So PI and Holding no longer exist as penalties y'all
how dare u
I mean, is he any good?
Biggest play of the game right here. 
That guy on the sideline was holding them back
Adrenalin 
Alabama's oline's getting away with bear hugs
This has the pacing of a NFL game.
#RANCH ME BROTENDO
Talk about a moral victory
Dunno how the announcers are forming coherent sentences over that Bama dick they're gargling
How they not calling holding every. Fucking. Play?????
"Loading, please wait"
Georgia feels like they are losing by a few points right now. Just so much momentum away from them.
Yeah uh what the hell
Hes played some.
It was on their script LUL
T R U E F R E S H M A N
Yes.  Yes.  Use those timeouts early.
Bamas really showing out that 5* depth chart now lol
Freshman bowl 
Lmao...nifty? You mean nimble? 
Hard to watch game film on a guy that's never played before 
Yeah....sorry bout that
I want every flag we have to be fired at that man
Commercial break hells yeah
Hold for three for the love of god 
Swiggity swooty he throwin to that Jeudy
I hope not that was silly and then looked like he went after the coaching staff
Guineas is good! 
Ya gotta call a time out when you a true freshman.
I need to go to bed lol
Anyone else have the Hurts Over 59 1/2 rushing yards prop?  Dude had 53 at halftime... that should be a winner. Why does Saban hate. Me?
Alabama is now allowed to hold each play
RANCH ME BRO
> Good football is the most fun to watchFound John Madden's account
Najee Harris is like what you''d name a running back character in a TV show. 
Technically, Jalen will be 24-2 as a "starter" if bama wins this game.
Hold them to a field goal.
by 3 inches though
Shoot your shot fam.
You're already damned to hell. 
Sleep can wait give me that OT fam
As a GA sports fan the 4th quarter makes me really nervous. 
Little known fact: the quarterback is a true freshman.
Digging deep down the depth chart for a fresh set of 5 Star legs. 
Can bama''s truefreshmen ™ beat the Browns though
Alabama Qb hair donts
Looks like Bama is going to be better next year. All their best players are freshmen!
Seriously there's been a few blatant calls that haven't gone your guys way.
The Cardale effect 
College freshies are legal my guy
I want to see the save attempt where he broke through the other players holding him back, only to get supelexed by his coach 
Why does Alabama hate Scarborough 
Has there been an update on the guy who collapsed?
So are Bama fans finally able to admit that Hurts is a fucking awful QB?
I've been shitting on the ESPN app all season for buffering and stuttering during big games, so I guess I got to give it credit for hanging in there like a champ tonight.Sometimes I only get 11 pixels total, but at least the audio doesn't stutter and cut out.
Pawwwwwlllll
Always bark 
You're good! I've been searching twitter but can't find one. 
Commercials are such a buzzkill right now
Lots of holds on the O'line not being called
Georgia is gassed right now. Good thing they'll have this commercial break to recover. 
InB4 Bama uses a pick play for a TD
On both teams!
It was asking me for subscription info
The visors indoors gang is strong tonight
Judy Judy Judy
So many points left on the field
Jesus. This new QB rustles some jimmies 
LOL JALEN HURTS TOTALLY DONE-ZO. 
We talking about Draft?
Ok seriously how in the fuck have I watched blatant holding on three plays in a row with no calls
Aerodynamics.
Get out. 
That''s what I was trying to say typed too fast.
smith is ga's defense
Find you a girl who loves you as much as ESPN loves TRUE FRESHMEN 
The crazy thing is......the team that scores the most points will more than likely win this game. 
Now that there's a commercial about that fuckin hit
Hey Hurts, you like cheese and beer?
Well, yea of course you don't, you are a fan of that team. I am certain that UK will lose even when up by 30 until the absolute end of the game. 
Georgia threw it away. They had the ball with 10 points on the board late in the game and didn't have the weapons to advance.   
I'm watching peaky blinders now as an extra fuck you to ESPN. If the game thread is any indication I'm not really missing anything 
If I hear a reporter ask a question about how Jalen Hurts felt sitting out the second half I'ma be pissed. What a stupid question to ask. 
Notice Bama keeps giving it to the back thats running well.  Chubb could learn something from this guy.
Shit I''m rooting for Bama now. 
Oh shit I haven't thought about that song in years.
With this committee? I believe it 
I was just thinking that. He throws a really nice ball. Doesn't look bad at all, especially considering he got thrown in there and these are his first meaningful snaps 
Refs are going to have to call holding at some point
wtf a timeout? Has Georgia never faced an uptempo offense? what the fuck 
Georgia sports... Im used to it ):
lmao still can't get over 48. Mans gonna be on the next season of last chance U
THESE COMMERCIALS ARE BREAKING UP THE BALLS TO THE FUCKING WALL EXCITEMENT OF THIS GAME
I got work tomorrow ESPN! Thanks for all the commercial breaks. 
Freshman Bama is Scary Bama 
Dat elite 11
I''ve been hating this shit 
Hey now, Jalen Hurts overthrows PLENTY of receivers
Volunteering good, agree
I'm sorry but refs are NOT calling holding on Bama wtf.
This ESPN mega cast thing is quite possibly the cringiest thing ever. Listening to two dumpster anchors pretend to know college football is laughable. 
Whole game I''ve been trying to understand Gundy, he''s either too serious to be chatty or really doesn''t like being there/other coaches
Yea, I love having Tua in, but I can''t help but feel bad for Jalen.
I hate when people complain about the refs because I always feel like they exaggerate how bad it is.Tonight is the worst called game I've ever seen. 
I love nu-metal throwbacks done by marching bands.
How do you miss that enormous hold? 
Sweated his eyeblack clean off
Definitely. Third units are only required to play 4 conference games.
Nah, Saban doesn''t care how dirty his players are. Look at what is on he field playing for him currently. 
Even when Tua misses, he misses better than Jalen. 
B1G refs back on the Bullsh1t
Bama going full freshman. Bold strategy, Cotton
Who's a better NFL prospect: Harris or Scarborough? 
This is the epitomy of evil
Panacea potion
If Chubb doesn''t get some more action, ima be sad. This is his senior year hurrah. Let the man run a little Bama. 
You can't tackle if you're being held and there's no penlty. 
It''s driving me crazy. Every. Single. Play.
I want him in at RB.
Stairway to 7!
Wtb a holding call 
Any taller and the heart fails to support the extra mass
PUT ALL THE FRESHMEN IN!!!
From a sexual standpoint, this game is much closer than the score indicates
I''d actually pay for the pay-per-view to see that!
It''s not very big
Hunker down ya silver britches 
I'm so nervous omg
Buzz me mulatto
I feel sorry for yall
You''d think they''d mention that.
Bama strong. 
honestly would love that for Illinois 
I love you all 
Is anyone on the Watch ESPN app and watching the "TV Room" feed with all the coaches? Are you catching the stuff David Cutliffe is saying? 
>  for a grand finale... maybe Saban will pull a Joe oh, shit .. 
AND THEY WERE IN HIGH SCHOOL JUST LAST YEAR? 
Not allowed to call penalties on Bama
They will never call holds on Bama
Just tuned in what happened to jalen
[deleted]
*Looks At Flair*Wouldn''t you like that?
I'm sorry, I lol'd at your comment but I'm so upset at the officiating tonight that I'm downvoting all Alabama comments. Again, sorry, <3 keep being you.
 The media narrative of this game is going to be unbearable if Bama' pulls this out. Talk about a qb controversy circle-jerk. And its working for Bama. 
Good time out. Our line is struggling
 #notmychampions
This Hawaiian kid is already the best quarterback in Alabama history.
I love big linemen that have their bellies out. Something about it is so hilarious. Just so American.
Jalens problem isn't really accuracy, he just wasn't getting passes off
It's all about the run game with Bama.
The circle jerk is so annoying and I''m not even pulling for Bama
Can we get a gif of 78 murdering that Bama receiver?  
Bama Qb Is over throwing every ball rn

God I hate you 
Must win or cant lose?
These college football players probably live the best lives in the world.
Hehehe
Alabama is a little behind the times as a state
Freshman who replaced someone doing worse 
Tua gotta get over this overthrowing stuff. This is JPWilson type overthrows
Something something UCF
Calling the interception here
D is gassed. Good TO.
What's his record tho
these ads are true Freshmen
A D S A D S #ADS ADS ADS!
Probably used to throwing to 6'5" true Freshmen receivers instead of these short Juniors and Seniors.
Benched 
You should've seen the first one
freshman, freshmando something crazy, do something crazy
With both teams being in the SEC, the refs don't know who to be biased for
Benched
Hurts cost us 7 points in the first quarter. 
Jokes on you, you don't have a soul 
QB RUN IS TOO OBVIOUS
At least we can have that in common
48
That's how we felt against Cardale
Alabama player shoves Fromm's head into the groundBama fans: *silence*
I was really, *really* rooting for the Falcons, my dude
He wins, even though it doesn't look like it tonight. I was always in favor of Hurts, because he gets it done in the crunch, but he never utilizes the full potential of our wide reciever. He just dinks it every down, but when he gets a chance to go deep, he scrambles or throws it away.
Say the word "freshman" again. 
I've got a tinging feeling deep in my balls.
lol Bama RB 22 moved out of his stance. C'mon Stripes...
20-17 incoming. Then 20-24
He sucked 
Who decided it was a good idea to have this game so late on a work night?
[deleted]
He isn''t that good of a RB
SEC: It just ~~means~~ **holds** more. 
Benched
He did. I'm wondering if he got ejected by the coaches.
Billions
That's how the B1G feels about Ohio State
HAVE YOU BEEN LISTENING TO THIS GAME?
Benched
How do you plan on a football team scoring 1 point?
That's not hard
Probably transfer
Hell they put in a whole new roster.
**ESPN YOUR STREAM FUCKING SUCKS. FUCK YOU.**
You'll cowards don't even smoke crack
Benched
It was he right move he sucked the first half
Bama holding everyone 
I haven't seen a Georgia game where Roquan Smith doesn't throw someone down out of bounds. Fuck that.
I think Hurts phone background will be Tua this year...
Its like Samson. They are the source of our power.
Big 10 officials dude I don''t think there were any called on our opponents this season 
That's a 10 yard sideline standing-on penalty on Georgia.
Benched after 1st half
He couldn't pass
Benched
-Bleacher Report
Well, theres the guy that collapsed, jalen hurts, and the guy that punched his coach. So 3?
I don't think his knee could still be recovering from last year
Lots of practice
he ded
Benched
A field goal makes it a one score game.  No way you give up a FG now.
Can't wait for ESPN to hype Tua Tagavailoa all offseason if Bama wins.
^^^^^^true ^^^^^^freshman
I bet nick saban watches the Big Bang theory 
That was a blatant hold on that Long run by Harris
UGA been holding all damn game. these refs dont give a fuckkkk
Pulled
Riding the pine 
So brazy
Bama sloppy tonight, Saban gotta catch those types of mistakes. 
Hi yes, I'd like to order a guy impersonating the refs followed by a team brawl? Great, thanks.
Any chance this game ends by midnight? 
No not these fucking Nisan commercials again. Please I thought they were over
They all look the same.
No tell me 
Pulled for being a shitty QB
Benched.
I've never seen anything like this. Saban is just purging all of the upperclassmen in the second half of a NCG. This is so wild.
/r/OneTrueFreshman
Found John Madden. 
I was really impressed by his vision on that drive. He made all the right cuts to the right spots.
he got benched at the half.
He was poopy
Bama wouldn't even be in it if not for blown calls. 
You missed John o Korn
Like the bikers give a fuck that his car parks itself.
Played like shit 21 yards in the first half 
This AT&T commercial belongs in r/fellowkids
Jalen must feel like shit rn
LETS APPEAL TO THOSE MILLENNIALS WKTH GAMER STUFF!
The state of Georgia curse is creeping in
I''ve lowered the bar for tonight''s expectation:  as long as Oregon doesn''t win.
Watching coaches feed. They haven't said anything much. Was hurts pulled for injury or no?
Lol
Big if true 
Did not play well...at all...
Any neutral fans streaming the game on ESPN, I cannot recommend the homers channel enough.  The stream is smoother and it's awesome watching Aaron Murray/Landon Collins getting intensely into the game.
so much holding
Just tuned in what happened to Baker Mayfield?
Partially defatted peanuts
Yeah i was thinking if I noticed it...it was bad
He's not a good quarterback.
He got pulled after a shitty first half. 
Refs are missing a lot of things though
UCF beats both these teams don''t @ me
He was playing like ass, Tua came in and has been awesome.
Unless you're an Alabama or Michigan fan you can complain about the refs
Freshman, 25-2 as a starter, freshman.  Have I missed anything?
I haven't add that issue at all. 
THE BEST OF THE BIG TEN 
Pulled at halftime.
What's he saying?
Is that not Beck in that commercial? 
Got benched for Tua
You're one to talk. 
I know nobody cares but I have to get it out somewhere and I hope some ESPN rep comes across this.  You have the shittiest live streaming service I have ever had the displeasure of using.  I do not understand why a multi-billion dollar company owned by one of the largest corporations in the USA can't get this right.  I can watch an off the wall stream from some shit site that is better than your actual live stream.  It's honestly abhorrent.  I am done watching this game, which I looked forward to all day, because ESPN has absolutely ruined it.  The least you could do is stop blocking others from streaming so your piece of shit isn't so shitty.  Hell!  It may even reduce traffic and it wouldn't cut out every 15 seconds.  I watch 2 plays and then I have to reload your piece of shit.  I'm fucking done.  And I know I'm one person who probably isn't your demographic anyway, but if you keep up this putrid vile eventually you will lose even more people than you lost when you decided to dump all of your funds into shitty talking heads debating cleat sizes.  Whoever is in charge of WatchESPN should truly be ashamed for putting out such a piece of filth that it stops people from enjoying a sport with no viable alternative.  Fuck you ESPN.
The people who think it''s fixed are fucking idiots. They wouldn''t let it stay more than one score apart for most of the game if it was fixed, they would make it a back and forth game. 
I wonder if the sign their loi's with dreads or it happens once they get to campus?
Same reason they aren't getting called for face masks and punching our QB in the head. We just aren't allowed to know the reasons.
UCF: One natty for you and one natty for someone in your squad.
Brown was pissed that someone told him UCF were national champions.
He shit the bed
I''m a New Englander, our football doesn''t exist. Went with the trigger flair for bama. Nothing personal gamecock
Nissan: Hello fellow kids do you like videogames^TM
Your boo huh, is that what the kids are saying these days 
Tbh I'm just rooting for bama because if I can't be happy then no one can
AS GAWD AS MAH WITNESS THE SEC IS BROKEN IN HALF
He was shit in the first half
Saban pulled him after a half
He ded
Fuck look another shitty movie
In Kansas? I think that''s the new school of LC:U. 
[deleted]
[deleted]
Everyone sucks at the magic cock of Saban, haven''t you heard
Benched.
Bama you have UNLIMITED HOLDING . Garbage
My dad keeps chanting "Hoooold them HOOOOOOOLD THEM" like a young Michael Caine in Zulu at the Georgia defence. I think the Bama O-Line is listening too closely. 
Good timeout
For real man, he fudged up big time!
NEVER.
Have been for decades
Come on man. 
Offensive linemen can hold jerseys if it is close together. They just can't hold jerseys on the shoulder pad area or really the outside area of a player.
Anyone dumb enough to do this died in the first quarter
No but Tula is undeniably better.
Just like Iowa huh?
Which one of the bands is playing that tone that's going to give me a damn heart attack after every snap 
He got benched because he can't throw and Bama was down enough to consider passing the ball.
Benched at half 
Niftble. 
There's a new daddy in town, and his name is Tua
Feel free to call the holds at any point refs, jesus.
Buy buy buy
You should have seen the guy before him.
Regardless of who wins the game, this is more of a victory for true freshman everywhere
They haven''t called any holding all game... no one cares anymore I guess
he sucked, so he got benched.  although I think G's D is really that good. 
He sucks, this guys good. Thata about it
but that makes the joke less funny
I dun wanna Richted
Couldn't move the chains to save his life
What's he saying?
They are so much fun. Pick a team and follow the whole season!
Buttoning a denim shirt all the way up is such a hipster look
He's scared bruh
Still getting plenty of commercials. They aren't letting them play. Georgia can't take a step off the sidelines but Alabama can hold and shove people's heads into the ground.
They are saving it all up for a single makeup call that taints the victor.
AT&T just used the word "squad." I guess that word is officially dead now. 
Bamas O line getting gold medal judoka level grips and getting away eith it
My frienemy is commercials
Yanked
If Hurts was in, they'd lose before the final drive. 
Benched.
Ouch.
Saban better reach deep down in that playbook and find a freaking pass play that doesn't involve dropping gift wrapped-fades.Speaking of books, today is the anniversary of the first Lithuanian-language book, Simple Words of Catechism, being published in Königsberg, 1547
It started at a reasonable time.
It is
Les Miles and bad clock management. 
Benched after a bad first half
this freshman backup is better than any QB we've had in 15 yrs (2nd to russell wilson)and were a top 20 programchill out bama got damn
Georgia isn't going to be able to recapture the momentum until they start attacking their own coaches
"Cam Newton may need receivers, but I don't." - Jalen Hurts probably
Ratings are more important than anything. Duhhh 
Benched for the true freshman, held to 27 yards of offense in the first Q.
Am I the only United Kingdom fan still awake? 
zHe suck Tua not suck as bad.
https://twitter.com/Claudio_GSN/status/950578249888882688
so has georgia's
He's dead man. Saban chewed his ass out so hard it gave him a heart attack.
> now
Nick Saban is a true freshman
Nope fuck that, refs still blew TWO calls against Georgia that resulted in Alabama football and their first touchdownNever forget. 
I think the world would be a better place if we banned car commercials.
Think Hurts loses his starting job after this game?
It could be because of Smart not having film. That could be a major reason he changed QBs, wouldn't be surprised if that was the plan all along. 
That's what I've been told
They'd start the season ranked #3 so it doesn't seem fair really.
Telenovela has got to come up big here
Bamas 2017 recruiting class seems decent
That freshman QB for Bama aims the ball too much. Does too much with his arm, not enough with his back leg and hips. He needs to fix that.
I'll take pandering Nissan commercials for 200 Alex
Played bad in first half. Freshman started second half and drove them down for a TD on first drive. He''s very good so far.
Imagine a poo emoji sitting on top of a bed emoji
“Saban, unthinkably, just trotted a middleschooler from the class of 2022 our to play, really going deep on the bench this game”
H8 FEEDS THE GOOD BOYES
Any update on him? I saw him push that girl before he sat down but low key wish they would pan to him a few more times. 
Haven't heard that, You got any verification for that? 
Fuck that was brutal
She was designed in Cupertino
With 10 less minutes on the field?
I have never wanted anything so bad. 
I thought GT fans would be cheering for Bama
Can we get Lou Holtz to say Tua Tagavailoa
anyone know who the girl in the Nissan rogue commercial is?
Unless you''re #48
Wallpaper of him on sideline incoming.
Is the ref one of them?
ded
It looks to be paying off
Its way faster than Tebows though. I think its just because he's left handed it reminds you of Tebow. Mechanically its a lot different
lol what?
SABANNNNNYOU THINK VISORS ARE COOL?!?!
[Commercial!](https://youtu.be/MMvzMnjxHiY?t=19s)
During the game it''s amazing. Still better than same commercials over and over 
gotta try
Gotta replace Baker and Darnold with someone.
Strikeout.me may have it
They all come from the same basic black magic ritual.
Yeah but his bad throws are slightly better than Jalen''s bad throws!
Roquan to Tua " I want you smothered want you covered like my Waffle House hasbrowns." 
Hurts to Nebraska confirmed
How would that help Bama come back?
Someone on Twitter said that he responded.
noooo I thought mayhem guy was changed
New substitute for Bulldogs: true freshman Drew  Brees with mustache, Le'Veon 'true freshman' Bell, Sean Lee engineering major who happened to be good at football, and Julio Jones who was a swimmer for UGA who was recruited recently. 
Science, bitch 
That's literally what I just said to my wife. Dude saved him so much trouble.
The fucking holding...Jesus Christ these refs need to be fired and working at a call center by Wednesday
well yeah. I mean Darnold is gone dude 
Lol I said the same thing. No way in hell he can think he was right. Shit I'm agreeing with a Buckeye. What the hell is going on?
Already transferred to UAB
Glad it's not just me
They haven't been calling it on the right side of your line all night either. It's like they're blind.
M. Brown - 48 Bama
big stop needed here Dawgs
Bamas offense sucked ass minus jalen, they pulled him and now they're playing good
What's he saying?
I''m watching this game with my British grandmother who has never watched American football before and she''s just as into it and yelling at the tv like I am 
Hurts and Eason... there''s room for you guys at Illinois. 
They will do it either way. Bama will open at #1. 
He failed
Hearing Fowler yell JUDY! Was very amusing for some reason 
First game to honestly make me wonder wtf is going on with these refs. 
HUGE hold missed on that play, this is terrible
I don''t think he started the first game last year but I could be wrong 
I would be pissed if my sideburns/beard were that bad too
Congrats to Alabama for winning the 2019 and 2020 national championships
it would be fun
More monster running backs with dreads. Bama has to be making these kids in a lab. Basically the same RB with a different number every year 
We just gonna ignore all penalties because Bama right? 
how many fucking times will I hear about primetime nba
When have I seen that from a Georgia football team before... 
There were umm other things I wanted to do inside my car while listening to the game that I couldn''t do inside.
I meant that I wanted uga to hold bama to a field goal.
He's been ineffective.
Everyone who said this is a bad game have the football taste of people who eat nothing but McDonalds and Applebee''s when they travel abroad. 
1 4 ur squad
"One for you, and one for someone in your squad," wow this phone company totally gets us! lmao #squadgoals
Power source. 
Anybody else notice Tua took off his eye-black?
It started at 5 on the west coast
That's including the commercials.
Worse, he watches young Sheldon
benched
The Allstate guy broke his resolution! Madlad!
It was a blast. I just wish my school could have been more than a perennial 6-6 team.
/r/CFBstreams
"You can't prepare for that tempo in practice."Big 12 contingent: "This is a tempo game?"
Come on guys, hollllld
That's what she said. 
Riley Reid
If they go into overtime Alabama will be fielding kids who aren''t old enough to drive. 
Fuck this nissan commercial 
That was an incredibly tight window to hit that fade. Better than a turnover 
Piper Perri
Hurts is horrible. Saban clearly thinks so or else he would not have made such a drastic move in the best game of the season
Bama just casually subbing in a 5 star QB and the #1 RB recruit
buy ethereum
They know. They don''t care. :(
*flicks cigarette*That''s a name I haven''t heard in a while 
Pulled for not doing anything 
Holds holds holds holds holds holds...yep, these are our refs
Every year I say this
because they know we will watch it anyway.
Do you get automatically put on the Dean's List if you win a national championship? It would be hard to argue against it
bachinka 
It''s bad
Bo. That man looks like a fucking monster.
Yeah, this sub is so trashy to Alabama and fans, getting downvoted for saying exactly what they''re fucking doing
I'm nervous and shaking. Is this what Chihuahuas feel like all the time?
It's for speed...
To be fair, both teams have been holding a lot.  They're actually calling that the same on both sides.
FLAIR UP
Hell yeah! And fuck the pats!
true manfresh
Is it a requirement for Alabama QB's to put some blonde in their hair or??
So *that's* why he's still cheering them on
Here's a guy who wants to say something about a post, then he comments on it
You get a hold and you get a hold, EVERYONE GETS A HOLD!
But Mayhem I did stick to the resolution I never made.
Yeah, none of the blatant holding is being called.
You don't say?
Holds**
I'm watching a bunch of youths playing beer pong and talking about who knows what instead of commercials.
Is 48 still in the game or did he get kicked to the locker room?
Will jalen hurts be on the next season of last chance u? 
Man, I really don''t want either of these teams to win. 
https://streamable.com/anszofrom the gif thread
@u
Looks like a freshman
Wait are there any freshman playing? Why won't somebody tell me 
They're hyping him regardless.We're going to get 30 different segments a day over whether or not he or Hurts should start.Hell, I guarantee they debate it on First Take tomorrow.
Just my enemy 
It hasn''t even been two weeks from the New Years, mayhem guy. Cmon
MAYHEM IS LITERALLY THE DUMBEST CHARACTER EVER I'D RATHER SEE THAT CUTE LITTLE GECKO THING
I''m scared. Someone hold me
does anyone else think there is a 0% chance these are the two best teams in the country?
As if Alabama losing would derail that hype train.
I see you trying to copy my username....T-sips always trying to copy us Aggies #firstpublicuniversityintexas /s
at least 11
Out of your league
Holy shit. My cable just went out as soon as Bama started that drive.I ran as fast as I could to pull up Watch ESPN and now Bama is on the fucking 13.LIFE SAVER!!BUT FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK WHAT HORRIBLE TIMING
Effort. Effort and intent. And effort. 
[deleted]
And here I was wondering what Najee Harris had been up to this season....waiting for his moment, apparently
Chubbs UGA career needs to be over if they're gonna win this game 
Not exactly what I'd call a swing, but yeah.. Absolutely unacceptable. 
This is what we fucking get with Big 10 refs. I was hoping for ACC
I think they call that "the clap" 
Daisy Ridley lookalike #1
For sure
I just hope UGA wins for the Squidbillies episode tbh
Very British, honestly. 
Don't be jelly of the Florida National Champions ™ 
I love Chubb but he is averagin 1.5 yards. Sony is at 7.5. Even swift is at 3.8
o7
Oh no I thought I would never see that fucking Nissan commercial again
CAPTAIN PAUL WATSON WILL STOP THE ILLEGAL WHALERS
my ears are bleeding
Bama is selling out to stop him when he''s in the backfield.
Just remember folks the only national title the state of Georgia has won was because we played Cleveland
Assholes. That's who.
The fact that our starter isn''t playing. Our backup is in
*JT Barrett 
I'm watching through spectrum app on roku
I've been good up until now, but fuck it, it's time to start drinking. 
Nick Saban is the kind of guy who watches Independence Day and cheers for the aliens. 
Yay a new copypasta!
What time is it there?
Nope.
Yeah he's done.
They've been cursed for a while now. Where you been?
I understand
Darude sandstorm?That's all I got
can i get a link to this please
Is anyone watching on the command center? These "voices of ESPN" cuts during the commercials are sooooo cringy. 
Can this game just go ahead and have a fifth and sixth quarter? Ok thanks. 
Play it out
Don't you have work in like 4 hours?
Gonna need a gif of that hit
The offside call on the block punt is huge.
Has there ever been a team as stacked as Alabama this past decade? 90s Miami and 00s USC maybe?
Lay off the Gator Juice Breaux.
Most assuredly is. The Iron Bowl led to a white Christmas
So from why I''ve gathered: Then Dawgs is hell, Tua and Scarborough are going to be crazy together next year. And Minkah should be a top 10 pick
Has anybody seen Hostiles? Good movie?
ON AN OPEN FIELD NED
They purposely let the app be buggy to entice people to keep their cable subscriptions. It''s their business model. Disney can afford to have seamless apps. It''s a strategic choice.
All the network NFL streaming I watched this weekend was perfect it made me ever more mad at espn
RIP your inbox LOL
How long you going to be up?
It only works if it's a Strongbad commercial. 
We appreciate your loyalty.
No, it''s just easier to post from here since it''s where I spend most of my time.
Nah, the power is in the dreadlocks
Jon Bois?
https://tv.youtube.com/welcome/
My dick kinda hard
Man, what happened to Jon Hamm's movie career
This would be the first time a team from Georgia blew a big lead in a championship game since...oh fuck
Lol yeah what was that? They have problems over there on that sideline
Satan
So many holds that aren't being called
Tua with the save
No way. Tua gives them life. Georgia has Hurts number..
Upvote for the verb sprewell! Synonym for artesting!
5 hour long 4OT game in which my team isn't playing so I'm not stressed. Heaven.
So many commercials! Good grief, a 4+ hour game!
All aboard the Georgia train, next stop, national championship!!!
What bout pandering Chevy commercials?
lmao... my  bad dude.
We gonna get a holding call against Bama today? Holy shit. 
But have you gotten your taxes done???
Tua/Jalen QB battle is a valid discussion but will be beaten to death, revived, beaten to death, revived, until probably 3 games into next season
Harris. Scarborough is too stiff.
I'm drunk as shit now, got my first classes tomorrow. I just need UGA to pull through this last quarter
Bama like RBs with Dreads like I like women with curves. Can never get enough
They were talking about Jalen Hurts... not the freshman QB that replaced him.
The hell with that! If it''s blatant, call it!
Nah I naturally like to root for the team r/cfb dislikes. The subreddit gets pretty whiny at times.
I get older, they stay the same age.
I wonder if we'll ever find out where #48 will be sent off to
If any coach was going to put in a freshman and win I'd expect it to be Saban though
He''s trash 
Dude he was mid tackle... I hate bama too, but c'mon man
I have it daily. It''s almost like real life. Guess he wasn''t recording today cause I couldn''t find him on campus. 
Brothers. You missed the brothers. 
this bot is amazing
Shocker that the bama fan benefiting from this bullshit likes it
Sabermetrics stat of the day: 100% of Freshman named Tua do better than guys named Jalen in national championship games
georgia pls
I Always thought he was a little flamboyant 
He's a second string true freshman playing his first meaningful snaps in the national championship game. Dude is playing pretty damn well, have some perspective.
It''s the least I could do.
let's go Dawgs
Najee Harris would have looked really good in Blue and Gold....
I read this and I 100% agree. 
I want a show of Lou reading the dictionary 
Banished to the shadow realm
:)
Well good for you...I was lagging every  snap, it is very frustrating when you get perfect picture between snaps and then when a play starts..............go suck a dick.....
Hey guys, did you know Hurts is 25-2 as a starter?
It does seem like that....
HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF LEBRON JAMES OR BOSTON????WELL NEITHER OF THEM ARE PLAYING IN PRIMETIME THIS WEEK
this gonna go to OT and bama win 23-20 :P
No
They sure can't throw it. This guy has left 28 points on the field tonight. Even a mediocre QB would exploit the hell out of that slow ass Georgia secondary.
Dude that mayhem commercial hit me with the biggest plot twist ever
They don't give a shit because they just want you to subscribe via cable 
The amount of slobber he would generate would make uga jealous. 
Probably sitting forever but not kicked by the refs 
NFL Refs: If you breathe on this man wrong, it's a 10 yarder. CFP Refs: MORE FRESHMEN BLOOD FOR THE BLOOD GODS
I always wondered what kind of cowboy Batman would be
My neighbor is such an asshole. Shut the fuck up Dale.
Let spring ball play out, then we'll see
4.23am buddy
[Here's the vid of Alabama's 48 trying to swing on a coach](https://twitter.com/Sports_Burd/status/950578597932294146)
Side note: 37 minutes of commercials so far
Who would win? Two ESPN announcers versus a few freshy bois
Do I want a UCF co-National Championship, or delicious Bammer salt? This is like trying to pick a favorite child.
Sitting here thinking what other positions can Hurts play
Mekhi Brown to the Pit of Misery!
Go to the Homers channel, main stream is massively overloaded.  Fuck ESPN.
That backup db was the first sacrifice 
It's a big fuck you at this point. 
I'm baked af right now and this game is intense !!!
Even if Tua misses a few passes, he is sooooo much better than Hurts.
He got replaced by the best quarterback in Alabama history
Let's go good year blimp
Is that where the future felons congregate now?
Trust the process
I mean, he is in Atlanta. 
Obviously they can't. However 2 can be scored a number of ways, and a FG is obviously 3. 
After all this shit with NCAA MBB refs, these ones seem like Greek gods. Even with all their missed calls.
That doesn''t sound familiar.  I''ll have to double check that
He grabbed his dick and then died.
You're right, corrected. 
Yeah but it could have been much worse. All it is is bad. Not much more to say than a kid got heated and some dumb shit almost happened.
I can see that Bama is getting away with a lot of stuff, and I want them to win. 
Justice for jalen whos with me =(
Guess he''s had enough and is letting the young bucks out 
>Satan
I''m in a former colony, does that count?
...and RBs with dreads 
So, will they score?
I found it to be quite entertaining. Made me think of Twin Peaks.
...how have you not realized that college games take like an hour longer than pro games by now?
RIP "Squad". 2016-2018
A true true true true true true true freshmen 
Huge if true
wtf that app commercial was the worst thing I've seen since the "real people, not actors" Chevy commercials.
WAYNKAS
Yes! The song is Girl from the album Guero. One of my favorites.
Mayhem. NBA. Mayhem. NBA. Mayhem. NBA. Mayhem. NBA. Mayhem. NBA. Mayhem. NBA. Mayhem. NBA. Mayhem. NBA. Mayhem. NBA. Mayhem. NBA. Mayhem. NBA. Mayhem. NBA.
We can't get anything out of our backs. Better put in the newest five star player.
Thanks!  I''ll give it a go
I've been bad. Very bad.
The ESPN stream is garbage.
yea way better than Joe Namath
Finally time for Alabama to reach its potential, been a rough couple years. 
Oof
My chubby ass would have 15 wins minimum as Alabama''s QB
Don't do AJ like that!
I had Cam and McCaffrey on my fantasy team. Cam also doesn't think he needs receivers. Or running backs. Fuck cam newton
I said what I said. 
I bet ESPN still uses the Microsoft cloud and that is why the stream is so shit. 
Win or lose its gonna be great for that
Harris* not Scar
Welcome to B1G refs. Hold all you want and get a warning for slugging an opposing player. 
Jimbo Fisher, Texas aTm and reliance on Heisman trophy qb''s 
The B1G refs don''t like to call holding. You have to practically murder somebody to draw a flag 
I hate seeing players with their arms like that. 
If I hear the term "True Freshman" one more time during this game im going to explode!
All those fans are true freshmen!
I need to get a job in AT&T's marketing dept. Must be nice to be so rich that you're so out of touch with the world that you think people are giving away an iPhone, even if it is 'free'.
You just wait till our new wide receiver comes in. He''s still in high school. Will probably get 300 receiving yards in the quarter.
I need to watch more college football now that I''ve graduated. Third year in a row I missed so many games because of school.
Something close probably. I'm having heart palpatations. 
Why do they even have play callers and color commentary? The Stadium announcements per play have all the information you need. 
START???!??
Never forget lmao
Yaaaaaas mayhem is back!
So is Hurts the worst starting qb bama has had in the Saban era?
I wonder how many clueless fans are in that stadium just mindlessly cheering while not knowing how football works
There's too much blood in my alcohol system!
Yeah just pick them in the draft whenever you can. they just keep bringing them in.
Well we all saw on the first drive of the game what happens when you under throw   
Hot take: Georgia is going to have to stop Bama from scoring to win this game.
Yeah this exact officiating team won the 2016 michigan game for ohio state. I have no room.to complain lol
Your flairs hurt 
Not with JT at QB.
First I''ve seen of it. 
What? Of course not. I'm not salty about our 4-7 season at all /s
It's none of you have ever seen a SEC game before. They haven't called holding in like three years in this conference.
But these commercials have been seamless yo! Dilly Dilly
I still enjoy a lot of the other aspects, but watching some dude get his head knocked off isnt as appealing as it once was 
Hes a senior so...
Fuck ESPN. And fuck Bama. 
not another one of these games bro... 
Your flair is confounding me
My buddies and I are having that same conversation right now. It''s like Saban has a requirement 
If it were fixed, they would have ruled that long touchdown out of bounds and enforced the penalty from the spot.
I''m a bjj guy, I wish my grips were as strong as Bamas o line and my spider guard would be unpassable
Only Bama would have this much talent wasting away on their bench all season. Crazy what their "not good enough to break the lineup" guys can do. Send some of that to my Dores...
Downtown Atlanta looks nice. I gotta visit 
AND... We're at CBS level bad on these commercials
It's like watching any team against the Cowboys, with these lack of holds.
Yeah, this is just incompetence. It's one of the worst called games I've seen in a long time. Definitely in our favor overall, by a wide margin. But some God awful calls on both sides. It just makes the game a mess.
Tell them to all be freshman apparently 
Yep
What are the odds the girl holding that ROLL TIDE sign was there with her brother?
Just tuned in, where's Mike Shula?
I''d put Hurts back in NOW. 
Jalen Hurts gonna be the star of next Madden''s Longshot mode after his collapse
Fuck yes
He got arrested for stabbing that poor kid that they took to the hospital 
That's Harris, not Scarborough
It's terrible, isn't it?
“Tua, what kind of haircut do you want for the game?”“You ever seen Spongebob''s house?”
I wonder how much Disney likes ESPN playing beer pong during the NCG.
im sleeeeep lmao
Pls don''t Georgia sports this
Refs are just going to let the Bama oline tackle Georgia defenders soon

Why is Ryan O''Reily doing commercials for Allstate?
Everyone in America who has a job to go to tomorrow and read your comment just said OH PLEASE NO at the same time.

You know who should be in the coaches'' film room? Mike Leach.
I know, I don't like the guy but gotta admit he's ballsy.
BIG refs have called two holds for Michigan in two years. Rip you
Yeah Bama is going to be absolutely loaded for the next few years. Look at the number of true freshmen making plays out here

Oh shit that blimp almost hit the building
They don't understand. I'm not going to do that. I will sooner quit watching the sport. 
He's gone to the right guys, but he has been off more than a few times. Obviously right decision to put him in, but his accuracy has been iffy.

Probably not but 48 will 
Benched
Yeah we need to not recriut anuone with the last name of Brown. 
Switch over to one of the 5 other streams. No loading issues and no announcers. Its wonderful
Nah, Raise Hell Dale! 
No
I think it's a style fit issue.

Did you guys know that the Mercedes Benz dome has affordable concessions? /s
Congrats on your National Title. :)
UCF > * > Georgia > Alabama
Remember that time we were ranked? Good times
The browns 
Fucking portland
This Dutch on Dutch hate is just too much 
It's raining Freshmen. Hallelujah, it's raining freshmen -Kirk Herbstreit
don't remind me of those commercials
They should keep him on the front of the sideline and sub in players standing behind him for the rest of the game
P R E A C H
Siberia, hopefully.
They're playing all of the lights 
glad these players got to compete at the national level
lol. i think its a super entertaining game, its cfb .. how can it be bad?!?
dont worry we'll settle for a field goal.
Pass that shit over here bro
CAN THEY STOP WOTH THESE HORRIBLE PRIMETIME COMMERCIALS
Did he catch that in bounds?? 
wow
Yo that's a pick
What''s he saying?
That's a pick!
This is a B1G ref crew and we don't know what holding is
review that
Georgia D-lineman was offside.
U C FCF
Wait is that a pick 
THATS AN INT
Roll Tide
If you're a football junkie, and aren't already switching back and forth to the Coaches Room stream, check it out tomm in its entirety. Really, really good stuff. 
Which championship is your team playing in?
holy shit I thought he caught that at first 
What coach did he swing on?
Beautiful
Called it
Well luckily for Atlanta, they haven''t seen much of a change in traffic since the game has been in town
All aboard the Georgia train, next stop, national championship!!!
Marched bass and tenors, it was mostly brass that dropped for us. It was weird, like an epidemic. 
Inb4 10 minute Bama drive ending in a field goal
Jalen will follow Russell Wilson's footsteps and go to Wisconsin 
Nope, does not have possession
Turns out, Nick Saban is still mad at those who think Texas would have won in 2009 if Colt McCoy hadn''t got injured. “Fuck you, I can win with a freshman quarterback.”
Farewell D1 career 
true* freshman but nah youve got it
In the locker room waiting for the game to end so Saban can flay him living. 
I spy a juggle
Didn't have control
nah bruh
Go for it, fuck it
Holding is like icing in hockey and offisde in soccer. Nobody wants to see that shit.
Damn. Didn't realize he was local talent. Shame CAL couldn't get him, that would've been dope.
He cracked Kerryon Johnson's ribs doing that in the SECCG. This isn't about Bama. It's about him playing dirty in every damn game.
So close
i'd fuck her
Let's get your thumbprint, facial ID, and keep the mic on
It is when the guy is past you and you are still holding onto his chest 
wow close one
thats a pick!
how true are these freshman though?
The ESPN stream through SlingTV is pretty damn good to be honest.
oh he got that shit!
42 looks so done with his shit
January is the month where movies go to die
I want Cutcliffe and Patterson on the same coaches analysis table
Didn't look to have possession 
20-13 GA, bama in the red zone
They said, here's ya one chance Fancy, don't let me down 
Yeah he bobbled it 
I thought nobody could cover Jeudy
WatchESPN sucks
ooh, that might be intercepted
THATS A PICK??
The Flyin'' Hawaiian looks like Johnny Football
lol georgia lined up offsides, but of course no one is going to care about that.
Fuck yeah
At least they have a championship game to blow scUM
Not a pick. Didn't have control until we was out of bounds.
Thought it was a pick
Holy shit that receiver got at least five different cases of whiplash on the way down
Nevermind, not A pick.
has anyone checked on #17 on Alabama?  that truckin he took....
Nope, that's not a pick.
Not an INT
that's a fucking interception.
Lol, holy shit these lucky ass plays
Lol no that's Proud Mary
That's a fucking pick!
I don't think that's a pick cause of the double clutch
With a metal chair!
These refs tf is going on
Um yeah, thats an interception I think
I think that was an interception
FUCK YES I am here for that 
Mods can''t ban me if the chat is moving too fast
Has it after his foot is out.
damn would have been a nice pick
Real MVP
Not an interception
Not sure throwing into triple coverage is a good idea there bud
Go for it!
Not a pick 
He bobbled it. 
No chance is that a pick 
That was good
No possession 
That wasn't a catch but I don't think you can get any closer
Oh man that was almost God-tier.
Touchback patriots
I don''t know what a catch is anymore in this sport
WOAH, YOU'RE RAMADAN STEVE.
Man so close
there''s the pick I calledITS A PICK REFS
He could dye his hair blonde, wear Jorts and a fanny pack and he''d still be the coolest person in Alabama 
It didn't look like he even meant to catch that lol
4 got knocked the fuck out daamn
refs
[deleted]
That is an int
Are you there? What are the prices like?
They weren't holding hands or anything, so I'm going to assume they're unrelated.
Not a pick. 
[deleted]
No matter what happens, we know that one of these fanbases will be partying with no end in sight.It will almost be as crazy at that time on this day Jan 8th, 1454 when the papal bull Romanus Pontifex awarded the Kingdom of Portugal exclusive trade and colonization rights to all of Africa south of Cape Bojador.
That's a catch if you don't move it from your leg
ESPN gave Alabama fans 3 shots and only gave 2 to GeorgiaIt''s biased and unacceptable/s 
TIL
Oof he popped it back up as he jumped
thats an int. give it to him
Close but no catch. I think it''s the right call 
The Band sounds great!  Is that Kanye they're playing?
Nope
REFSSSSSS
That's close, but I'm thinking not an interception. 
Lol 
Not a pick. Bummer.
No catch 
Lost possession after jumping in the air. 
not a catch
Nope in the air
i don't think he had possesion
dang, a few inches from being an INT
Ah my b. I''ve been watching on my phone, with no WiFi since I just showed up in my new apartment tonight 
Damn, that would have been INT had he not shuffled it.
[deleted]
nope not a pick. ball moves when he doesn't have his hands on it
Close but the bobble makes it incomplete, right?
Jeudy almost got decapitated there.
Stomped out his throat there
Alabama literally fucking sucks. Can't even throw the ball
so glad we have Goodyear covering a closed dome
He juggled like a circus clown 
hmmm... did he control it?
He was out of bounds
Pick!!!
WHAT IS A CATCH CFB EDITION
Damn that was so close. Not a pick though 
Not a pick
Yeah I knew the refs didn't do anything to him, but was hoping Saban kicked his ass to the curb.
Not enough evidence to overturn. 
Ball went in the air, re-established out of bounds, no catch. Sorry, SandersJeudy got crushed though
Don't think he had possession when the feet were down.
THAT play design just sucks.
Interception time!
"WHAT IS A CATCH?"
This one?https://twitter.com/CaseyBake16/status/950583255035777024
Dean Winters is a national treasure. 
I just don't want to be reminded of the Super Bowl. We don't talk about it. 
Didnt have control of the ball in bounds.
Fans logic. Just cheer regardless of wtf happens
"Stands"
INT!
It moved a ton after he first caught it. 
Yeah I guess so, if anything I just see them as being the benchmark of excellence which isn''t a bad thing.
This is a replay we actually need
Oooooh that readjustment. 
Should be a pick but technically not
No control, sorry
Definitely not a catch.
OK that's a bobble and out of bounds right?
Hey, I guess you're new here. 1) Yes, we've established that bama doesn't get penalties this game, 2) UGA seems to be holding up okay to that, 3) UCF are the undisputed NCAAFB champs for the 2017/18 season, 4) Purple Wizzard.
Oh yeah??
He keeps yelling Roll Tide
Yeah, I just haven''t seen bama, namely their defense, take so many cheap shots, and that guy even went at his own coach 
As a neutral fan, these controversial calls are amazing.
Not a pick. Ball moving. 
That's not in control
INCOMPLETE 
Hard to say if he had control on the replay but I thought he had it live.
No you creep
I hate being an “adult” and having to “work” on weekdays. 
Nope
That''s a catch 
I need healing. 
Besides when the ball was in midair after he got his last feet in?
Not an INT. He juggled going out of bounds.
bobbled before he went out
I mean, my heart is tellling me no
That's gotta count. This ain't the NFL. Catches are catches 
That''s a pick to me but it won''t be overturned 
INT INT INT
Classical reference.
2001 Miami was pretty good.
Bobbled it at the end 
Not a pick 
Throw in triple coverage.... c'mon man 
But he survived the ground /s
He was like, "wait, I intercepted that!"
Rooting for Georgia. Not a pick
Hmm, that is a bobble but it is a controlled bobble. He did it on purpose.
Kirby Smart just owns Daboll tonight. 
While you have a valid point, these are B1G officials.   ^^/Oh ^^shit.  ^^You ^^think ^^it's ^^contagious?!
FUCK YOU ITS JANUARY!
Jeudy got railed. 
Looks like a pick to me
[removed]
Das a catch
only if we can get coach O as well
NOBODY KNOWS WHAT A CATCH IS FUUUUUUUUCCCCCKKKK
No possession
There is no possession 
arguably a pick, but absolutely not enough to overturn
That looks like a pick to me
I didn''t know I needed this in my life until now
Nooooo don't adjust your dang hands there and that's an INT
ITS ABOUT TO GET CONTROVERSIAL
That ball 100% moves in mid air and he doesnt get a foot in
Ball moved. 
Tbh I thought of Proud Mary by Creedence when I heard "big wheel keep on turning"
TIL
These references are out of control 
Oh man, I'm all for shitting on pro-Bama refs, but I think that *has* to be incomplete.
I like the call to put the Hawaiian in but Saban should have put Hurts back in in the red zone. 
no, its not.
Didn''t have possession
Oh no I don't need more controversy on what a catch is
Fuck these refs. That's a interception.Edit: Woops, guess it wasn't.
That is not a pick. He lost possession in the air and didn''t get his foot down
Not an interception 
Damn. He didn't secure that but that would have won the game imo.
Better than Seattle sportsing it
Oh man that was so fuckin' close.  Holy cow what a great play by him though.
he didnt have possession.  
man in football that's a catch.  in slow mo, fuck slow mo.  that's a fucking catch. 
Don''t talk shit about maze runner 
Or if you are Alabama
Oh shit, he did let go for a tenth of a second. DAMN. 
Holding is a dirty word.
No way that guy wasn't lined up in the neutral zone.  
This isn't your typical Georgia team. #over
Wasn't sims a similar qb though?
Oh shit!! Here we go. What an effort! 
Well, good luck to the refs figuring this one out.They've been bad today but I don't envy them for having to make this decision.
I hear everyone complaining about holding, but the only holds I've seen have come after the ball is out of the zone.
Sadly no...out of bounds
Pit of Sarlaac
That would be a real bad decision. A fg makes it a one score game. 
No
*breaks erratically*
It''s been once people are past them, should have been more clear on that 
Being a lefty is definitely part of it, but the way he brings it back is really the part that strikes me. Footwork/follow through is definitely different, but the pullback is super close.
If that was Alabama, that's a pick 
they'd never call that a pick. Good effort though.
Pick on the playground, not according to the rules or replay
Dude shoulda never let go of it. This'll get confirmed though
I think there was a bit of movement of the ball after he jumps and is in the air.
Helmet off. Not smart. 
Just got off work, is Jalen Hurts hurt or something
No pick most likely but hell of an effort 
That's not a pick.
he caught against his leg and moved it up to his hands
For real though, but he doesn't get full control until a step out of bounds :(
An assistant coach or looked like. Don't have insight into the staff names
What's a pick?
As much as I want it to be an int I don't think it is.
Don't think he got it 
With these refs. That's not a catch.
Good call. He doesn't control until he steps out.
HOW ARE THEY TRYING TO FUCK GEORGIA ON EVERY SINGLE PLAY
Atta boy 
Great try, but its definitely incomplete
Falls out of bounds that's an INT. 
He's got to go. Send him to Auburn. I mean...
Official literally had no idea where the ball was.
I've been barking loudly in my apartment for a couple hours now, trying to cheer on Georgia. My neighbors think I'm insane now. 
That''s 100% Georgia''s ball
He has to switch it to control it in his hands, and his feet are OOB by the time he secures it.
Close, but i think no INT
That should be a pick, the catch rules are such bullshit 
Fire up chips!
who isn't?
Might have gotten the call if he swung at the ref
Bobbled, no possession 
Ehhh
Lol why
how georgia get 4
Not a pick but so close
If Sanders hadn't taken his hands off the ball.....
Lol that ref didn't even know that he had the ball. 
It came loose for a split second, stupid asss throw. 
Did he not pick that?
I've only watched the second half but it really feels like the refs have a cursive "A" somewhere on one of their shirt labels
I''m leaving.... on that midnight train to Georgia
So close, good call
That''s a fucking interception. 
I don't think it's a pick, sadly.
That's not a pick
Damn it was close but the ball moved when he was in the air.
Review it for commercials!!!
It took them that long to review it? REVIEW IT RIGHT AWAY
It'll stand.
I... I have no idea lol
That's a pick
I hope so
*The world is a vampire* *DUN A DA DUN DUN DA DUN*
no, it's not. at all.
If Jesse James didn't catch it neither did he sorry I'm still a salty Steelers fan 
No it wasn''t, the let go of it and then jumped out and regained the ball.
Nah
Then again, I have no idea what is or is not a catch anymore
Don't think so. There was no control but heads up play.
when your ex shows up at your funeral but she's actually the one that killed you 
Wow.  Good one
I don''t think he had it but it was a damn good play 
I really don't think that's a catch.
Can't imagine them overturning it, though.
Any other Michigan fan suffering from recruiting PTSD right now? Nauta, both Harris RBs, leatherwood, hardman, etc etc. how many of these dudes we finished 2nd for wow 
Did he just say "big wheel keep on turning" was the start of "Sweet Home Alabama"? Um....that's from "Proud Mary" 
This game is so fixed 
Makeup call?
Not a pick. 
Don't worry Alabama, refs still have your back.
Wrong side of the field boundaries actually
FREE!after you sign up for 3 plans and put down $600 deposit 
I don't think that's a pick sadly
TIL Jake Fromm was a Alabama commit in 2015... awkward
I don't think that's a pick 
Alabama can't win this with field goals
that's tough 
This isn't the NFL, that's a catch
Lesson to be learned here, keep stuff trapped against your balls 
So so close but he lost control of it. 
Not a pick
lol wtf
not anything, he didn't have possession with feet on the ground. but really cool looking.
If they're going to let Georgia's RB step on a sideline but call it inbounds I guess that's an INT. 
Worse than I thought
I''ll upvote this. I don''t know why, but I will. 
Alabama fans calling people hicks
Ironic 
I'd be surprised if they rule that an interception.But I hope they do! 
Almost exactly like that.
Confirmed
a lot of dudes who looked like they played the rich bully in 80s college movie at the game
Lol good luck deciding that 
100% not possession.
Damn that was close
If that was a pick would that be safety though?
This ref is a clear communicator
no catch
#intercepted
No control
Great catch but unfortunately not going to be overturned. 
Nahhh
would been school all time  record too
Kirk, you suck. Be neutral. That was an interception.
switched out in the third quarter
With any refs it shouldn''t be 
Don't most teachers get paid salary?
Close, but did not establish control until after the player was over the end line.
if he held it against his dick he had it
So close to an int!
Is this where we complain the officials are reviewing the play?
Microsoft's cloud is pretty great.
Nope just benched
Not sure what that has to do with anything.
He has no possession til he''s out of bounds. Ball is moving until his feet hit white.
https://i.imgur.com/UCYxoWn.jpg
EEEEEEEE
I actually liked them. But then they became delusional. Great season, great bowl win. The need to realize they played a cupcake schedule, undefeated don't mean shit with a sos in the 70s-80s. 
Not a catch, sadly. But MAN, what an effort.
That would be ruled an interception if it was Fromm throwing it to a Bama player.
Nah he got benched
Benched my dude 
Ooh you got them there. 
oh man the amount of crying over the refs when this gets upheld is going to be epic
Pulled
Ahhhh got it
C A T C H C O N T R O V E R S E Y 
Too much bobble
No INT.
How can the ref possibly make a call on that?
lol the ref had no view of that, this is why the call on the field being important is bs in some cases
This Triplett crew might disagree....
No, CRAZIER
MMMMMM, does he have control?  Wow, close.  
He didn''t have control, of course this sub will think he does 
The front of the jersey is fine, regardless. It's just the side/back of the jersey and the pads. 
Haha nice, I can't believe I missed that reference
No way that's a pick 
So no hit to the head calls in the Championship game huh?
WR4 got a foot to the throat also 
No catch :(
/r/nfl is this way...
Never-ending commercial more like.
No catch, but as a Steelers fan, who the fuck knows 
How is that not an illegal hit to the head?
Too close to call
We all would. Damn she was fine.
If he left it on his leg, that's a pick. But when he pulls it up.
Gotta be upheld, right? Never established possession in-bounds?
Kinda looks like he got control against his leg before he went outEdit: Just saw an angle that showed it clearly out of his hands
Definitely not a pick.Fuck of a play, but the juggle loses it.
No pick. And damn, great call by that ref.
Not a pick.  As much as I want it to be.
Nah 
Controlgate

I dont think they can call it a pick cause he juggled it 
Clearly not a pick. Bobbled it before establishing possession in bounds.
no way the ref call that in our favor
These players need to stfu and just play football. Waaay to much yapping going on.
I'd like to take this "was it a catch" moment to inform you that DANNY COALE CAUGHT THAT PASS 
Not a pick
I don''t know why but this is so funny
It's not.
There is zero chance that is a pick. If there wasn't enough evidence to overturn the dude being out on the long touchdown, then there is no way they can overturn this. He's bobbling the damn ball.
#DICK-ERCEPTION
INT
the darkest timeline
No but 
Reviewing the play just to save Bama from a delay of game smh
Will no one think of the commercials? 
Benched
That''s not s catch
That receiver got clocked
That is clearly not a pick
Bobbled, no possession. Shit :(
We was obviously using his leg to secure the ball.  This should be an interception 
Not a pick. Lost possession of the ball
Sorta in the same boat. I got offered the chance to at least audition and turned it down. Wanted the college experience without the commitments of that. I still don''t think I was good enough, and don''t really regret it. But it''s always in the back of my head. But on the other hand 2 of my best HS friends did join, one at MSU and one at UofM and they both only did it for a year, said it was way too much of a commitment for them. But they always have that memory, which is really cool. And that was the last year that Michigan was really good too for my one friend. 
lol what the fuck y'all have to be blind. 
JUST CATCH IT WITH YOUR DICK!!
How the fuck did the ref call that incomplete?
The both should already see the call is confirmed
PICK
This aint the NFL--that's no catch.
Absolutely was not
Nah
Should be a Georgia offside anyway - RT was lined up in the neutral zone.  This would be pretty shitty if it gets turned to a pick.
Yeah... dont think so
“The officials were notified that the play is under further review.”What the hell?
Pretty obvious that''s not a catch 
If I was Hurts I''d refuse that. 
This is going to end up being a sideline penalty on Georgia somehow. 
I want to call that a pick, but it isn't.  If he kept the ball pinned it would have been, but he popped it up into a better grip before going out of bounds.
Yeah there was definitely a split second while he was in the air with no hands on the ball
incredible effort but not a pickmore of a catch than Mike Adams in the NO/Carolina game tho
He needs to push that against his junk and just fall
I care what the rules are, that''s a pick. If a guy does that, you reward him with a pick
ooooof
Never forget. Those were the days.
No, Saban came out of halftime with the new guy
I want it to be a pick but the reasonable person in me says it is not 
Doesn''t have possession until he''s OB
Not am INT
good play but hes out
Not a pick 
If the rule says this isn't a catch the rule should change. He clearly caught the ball
That''s not a pick but refs these days will do anything. 
How is it a catch if he bobbled it. And his feet weren''t down
Nope
If I''ve learned anything from the NFL, there are no catches.
I agree
I think that's just an SEC thing 
A bama fan calling someone a hick?
Got eem
Took his hands off of it just for an instant. That'll stand as incomplete.
Nah they better not give him the interception
He looks like 21 savage 
By rule not a catch. By how rules should work, catch. 
That isn't control while in bounds. 
Got benched at halftime inexplicably 
Caught the ball with his dick
48's hissy fit: https://mobile.twitter.com/wonderousatx/status/950578700201885696
C'mon refs you owe us a couple 
that isnt a catch
Hell of an effort, but that''s bobbled.
Lol, that isn't a pick. Nice try.
Yeah this school thing is bullshit too
They asked Saban. The Emperor gave a thumbs down. 
That line is also in sweet home Alabama 
Bench
If Alabama loses this it''s because Saban''s last horcrux was buried under the Georgia Dome 
Espn wants Bama to win so fuckin bad
not an interception
Not a pick
No catch
Reported
Lol I''ve been before. They always usually talk about it. $5 small beers $7 large beers. $2 popcorns $2 peanuts 
Should''ve just held it against his leg.
He did not secure possession inbounds. Clearly not a catch. 
It was in the air
He's clearly out of bounds.^^^I'm ^^^a ^^^bama ^^^fan ^^^and ^^^this ^^^is ^^^biased ^^^AF. 
This catch or not shit is getting real annoying.
That was close, but not a catch
That's crotch control. It's a catch. 
How people can say it's a pick is beyond me
Really tough call... I think they''ll call it stands because it would be so game changing 
Would have been a better case for a catch if he kept it against his leg. Kinda like the helmet catches and whatnot
He never even held it
No it was not
Doesn't look like a catch to me
I thought he might have been locking his knees from all the nerves of being in such a big game 
Right? 
Yeah man..I think having Dykes as coach cost us a lot of croots
Don't think that's a pick but it's damn close
Time to repeat that time-honored zen koan of football: What is a catch?
This ain't the NFL! That's a catch!
Nah man, he didn't have possession.  
OK come the hell on he's bobbling and then lands out of bounds. I know my flair says Bama but he doesn't control before landing out of bounds.
Sometimes I wish we could go back to the day before reviews.  Games are taking a long time.
The refs need to check which jersey he''s wearing so they know how to call it.  
I've really been impressed with the ref crew tonight
So close. That would have been huge.
that shit was not close at all...wtf? what are people complaining about?
How? He was in the air
weird little hop to release control. so close.
That's incomplete, as much as I wish it was a pick. 
He bobbled it for a split second. That sucks for those guys though
BUT DID HE SURVIVE THE GROUND
Who the fuck  knows 
Could go either way 
I want this to be a pick, but it's not. 
Doesn't kinda, he absolutely moves it. 
You have to be full of shit..... stop being bias that was obviously not a fucking catch.
Depends on the union
Damn, I think the readjustment lost it for him
That's clearly not an interception
He didnt have control over the ball until out of bounds imho
[deleted]
That was not an interception, he lost control
Why would you draft two Panthers when Mike Shula is their OC?  You are terrible at fantasy. 
Amazing play but no chance anyone who isn''t biased as hell thinks that''s an interception.
Easy incompletion. Lost it in the air and then he was out of bounds. If you think that's a pick you're an idiot and don't understand the rules.
Not an INT 
I don''t really envy any fans playing in the championship game but at the same time I want to be you 
I love the unnecessarily verbose head referee
Nope. 
Oh. My condolences. 
If he just falls-down with the ball rather than makes that hop he'd have had the pick. 
This is what happens when you put big 10 officials in a SEC game.
What *is* possession?
Username tho
.........plz......your bias is showing.  
There's no way he has control. If they overturn this y'all all have to stop saying the refs favor us.
I'm just happy it's 4th down
That would've been such a hype pick but that's gonna stand for sure
No, it wasn't. Both hands come off the ball.
No catch 
NCAA 2005 Update: 3 straight run plays gets the Gators on the board and they get the 2 point conversion to go up 8-0 on Arkansas with 2:11 to go in the 1st
He should have kept it on his thigh, either way he had it the whole time, shitty rule 
Yeah didn''t quite secure it 
He was bobbling 
interception in college, incomplete in NFL
He has possession 
SHIT WAS DOPE
The dick catch
Benched at half.
No its not.  Im rooting for Georgia but thats not secured
So why was Chris Fowler singing "Sweet Home Alabama" exactly?
This is perfect, thanks friend
That's the right call, unfortunately
oh man had he just collapsed holding the ball in his crotch it's an INT, but the readjustment  made it incomplete 
I would say that''s no int 
Jalen Hurts to UCF confirmed
Interception if he drags the foot and falls over.
How is no one saying how Jeddy should be getting checked for a concussion?  That hit scares me man the two and then he loses his mouth guard from it.
we deserve like 10 makeup calls
the ball literally leaves his hands, what are you talking about
I hate Bama, and that wasn't a pick.
After the review of the play... it was a True Freshman!
lol at people saying this is a pic. obviously bobbled it
That''s tough, but I don''t think it''s a pick
So do these refs know what a catch is or 
Rule says it''s not a catch but it should be.
Fuck the Patriots so much. 
thats not a pick youre stupid
This announcer nearly jizzed his pants when he saw the ball move.
“How does it feel to be benched in the National Championship final?”Jalen: “Hurts.”
Dez caught it.  Sanders didn''t.
[deleted]
Alabama WR's gotta help the Freshman out...
BS
Well they thought you were insane before. You are just confirming it.
Lol wishful thinking
He juggles the ball when going out of bounds
Incomplete
That's what I'm thinking
nope
It's close, but clearly incomplete
Hell of a play, definitely incomplete. 
He didn't "lose it." If it looks like a catch, it is a catch. Screw all these rules
Fuck Dale
Nope, just wasn''t doing well so they switched it up at halftime because YOLO
Eh I wish he got it but that bobble
Bama ties do you go for two? 
No he's bad. 
I'm neutral and he doesn't have control until he steps out
Well it's 23:26 here in Columbus and I have to be up at 6:00 for work.
Obviously not a pick.
He didn't have possession inbounds.
Its no wonder People think refs favor bama with this kind of bullshit going on
I agree 
Because he was air born
It also bounces a bit before he gets possession 
SABAN BALL BITCH
Ball moved
That wasn't an interception... the ball was moving when he jumped in the air (inexplicably).
Tua as QB with Scar as FB and Jalen as RB with Harris as a Tight End and Ridley out left
I want that to be a pick because it looked cool but good call.
Shoulda just held it against his thigh
Not a pick.  Both hands came off while he was in the air.
false sophomore 
He had control wtf....zero chance UGA gets any call though
Unless it was bama who picked it off.  Then the refs would make the cal. 
Lost control after his foot touched. Obviously not an interception.
so close
WOW THESE REFS 
Good call. Georgia fans triggered
nice quick reviews
Good call. 
He's not playing very well. 
That extra pump will get you everytime
should've held it against his dick instead of moving it to his hands and it would've been a catch
Yeah not an int 
They *know* you''re insane now*
"look ma, no hands!" 
Bullshit 
Um, I think. A lil drunk, I think if he didn't bobble it up it's in an interception. 
DICK PICK
Don't see how anyone can think that is complete. He obviously bobbles it and then doesn't get a foot in.
Hmmm, I don't think that's an interception.
Alabama's kicker is so shook lmao
I hear Lane Kiffin is tweeting for him to come to thefau
Hey you know what would help? Throwing a few punches at a coach
That's the right call.
Good call
Football is so lame with rules like that, I mean that's a damn pick come on lol.
Because of the NFL hate circlejerk on here 
“Let''s check the Pylon Cam, that will probably gives us a worse view like usual”
bobbling until he got out of bounds
Garbage
Jeudy too a heel to the neck on that one!
no pick he bobbled after the last step in bounds :(
Not even close man... He had to reestablish possession after he last touched in bounds.
Don't think they'll overturn it. Not really possessed until after he's out of bounds.
Never had control
9:28 left in the season y'all
Big Georgia fan and rooting hard for them tonight but that isn't a "catch" in today's sense of the word (althoguht I think it should be)
I hate Bama as much as the next guy, but he clearly didn't have control of the ball. Also, fuck UCF.
He leapt and got the ball back. Should be a pick. 
It's a Big 10 officiating crew.
"dumb hicks"
No, it clearly wasn't.
right call
 You can't tell me what to do
Damn.... regardless great stop
Definitely not an interception. 
He didn't establish possession until he was out of bounds not an INT
That is clearly not an interception. If they couldn''t over turn a heel on the line they can''t overturn this...
Ok, refs favor you guys
We're in potential ESPN classic territory boys!
Good luck trying to overturn that call
Super close though
He didn't have control should be fine
I mean being on a sideline with 90 other rpeople all wearing full unis probably doesn't help  
Nope. If he would''ve kept it trapped it would''ve been a pick. Good call.
Shoudve cradled it with his nuts
He doesn't have possession.
don't think its a pick but wish it was
Go for it!
I''m not sure you understand what literally means.
Bama has gotten away with way too much this game
Andy Pastas
[deleted]
Because he wasn''t going for the player, it wasn''t helmet to helmet, and do you even know what an illegal hit to the head is?
Why are those pylons so far behind the boundary line in the end zone?
How can anyone have a name like Bacari Rambo and not be a badass?
Hahaha true
If they do, I will. But they won't.
Lol negative 
in the air
Man... If he just got his foot down and fell that would have been an INT.
CATCH
I've never seen someone have possession of the ball without touching it...
He popped it back in the air. No possession. 
Not a catch. That bobble did done that one.
Not an interception, unfortunately
I'd say that wasn't a catch, but if there's one thing I've learned this season it's that I don't know what the fuck a catch is
If it's control and a foot down then it's a pick before he moves the ball upward.
If a receiver pulls that off they call it a TD on the field, not necessarily after review though
It's fuck you down
How dare you! This is all he has 
It's not that clear. 
Was clearly bobbling the ball when he went out of bounds. Not an interception.
That was pretty blatantly not an INT. 
Can we just not kick this and try for it? I have ZERO faith in the Bama kicking game.
Sanders didn't get the interception. No grasp until after he was out of bounds. Close and would have been a hell of a pick.
So close
But what is a catch?
*Banned.*
He had it, but then lost control, no interception
I think Georgia takes this game, but having not watched him before, Tua looks pretty damn good for Bama
Now we need a blocked FG
Good effort 
#TRUTH
He didn't have it.  The refs still favor you.  =)
The ultimate test. 
Hey. I agree. 
Oh shit. Bama band just started playing "Time of your life" by Green Day. Saban's getting his yearbook signed and is crying with all his players. 
Ref making the call had a great view of \#24's back and zero view of the ball.
I'm rooting for UGA but that's a drop
Don't think that's a INT. If he didn't adjust he would've had it.
We should be up 31-6 or some shit like that.
Fake field goal for 6
Fowler has called the wrong players name like 10 times already.
Can''t even get a make up call which should be a catch
Guys look on the bright side: we get another field goal!! 
lol you know these big 10 refs wouldnt give us that even it was a good catch with control.
This game must be hell for you.
That's what it looks like to me
That was close but I do think they got it right.
good call refs
Wide left again come on
He''s gonna miss it
Catch
That's not a catch. No question about it???
You only need one foot down in cfb right?
Cfb isn't as shitty about catch rules. No catch here but Jesse James caught that fucking ball!
They're also the first words of the first verse of Sweet Home Alabama...>Big wheels keep on turnin', carry me home to see my kin.
Glad I'm not the only one that noticed that 
and no one is going to complain about the georgia player who lined up in the neutral zone.
Good call, sadly.  Go Dawgs, block this kick!
Refs got that call right. 
I bet that stands, maybe even confirmed.  Definitely not enough to overturn
That's not an INT.
At least there were no ads during that review 
By the way, whoever booked that horrible halftime show needs to be fired tonight, that was awful.
Oh shut up it wasn't even close
no way these refs give UGA this
Played as much football as anyone in the country? Tom Brady would like a word.
Idk I kind of thought that was a catch, but tough to overturn.
Come on man..
Rollercoaster kicking time
Kick six pls
Confirmed? That''s surprising. I think it''s right, but confirmed is a little strong. 
No u 
that wasn't a pick yall
It''d be a shame if he missed 
Anyone going to break the circle jerk and call the DPI? Calls going both ways
If Bama had made that interception it would have stood, 100%
Kickers are always so handsome 
Big if... not mine :(
Don't think any fans are playing
He has to steal a few laptops first, you know the rules.
What''s a computer?
In light of that Bama dude doing stupid shit... here's more stupid shit. https://streamable.com/3lqfx
**Fuck these refs.**
Miss miss miss miss
INT!!! Lets score now Dawgs! #over
Calvin caught it. 
No, but one here is still big.
damn that couldve been dick catchwouldve been the goat of all catches
Clearly didn't have control due to the bobble.
No. Didn''t have possession.
I really, really hate to say it but that is 100 percent the correct call. Can't have that bobble.
the WR got rekt on that play twice. 
Block
THE OFFSEASON APPROACHETH
[deleted]
Good Boy Alabama Kicker
Assuming there is stats. When was the last time Alabama ever had a holding penalty? 
Alabama : reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeGeorgia: reeeeeeeeeeeUCF : LoL 
Suck. My. Balls. 
Good call. Would''ve been a hell of a pick though.
That's why you never skip leg day
Don't bark at them in the morning please
Fake news
Can Georgia play two overtime games in one playoff?
That's the right call.
 Don't be that guy.
if bama loses this game do you think saban's gonna have nightmares and wake up and yellDAWGS!
I'd buy that's a pick. But I can't argue either way
War Damn Dawgs
Also, Oregon State. 
That's a catch in every highschool, peewee, and backyard football game and so should it be in college and the NFL. We've become so obsessed with codifying everything and have gotten away from the spirit of the game.
Definitely close lol but not a catch. 
inb4 miss
This is just a lose-lose situation for you guys lol sorry.
Ok, Hunker Down you Junkyard Dawgs! Hunker Down for me and crush their hopes right here! You've been in a bloody fight all night I know, but just hang on a little long guys, just hang on! Just keep chopping at em, boys, just hold, hold for us here
Andy Flopadopoulis
It's a pick cause f Alabama
It was incidental, the DB wasn''t trying to hit the WR, he was trying to get the ball.
Woke up. Thank god I''m waking up to a game
Holy shit
uhhhh. no it's definitely sweet home alabama
Benched. 
Those in glass outhouses should not throw stones
Close, but no control in bounds
Damn its a shame that Georgia player didn't have an Alabama jersey or that would have for sure been an interception 
Refs doing everything they can to help Bama. Jesus
[removed]
I want it to be but it's not 
I wish it was a catch, but it just isn''t. 
No. You can''t catch it with your groin. 
Were we suppose to pay extra to hear the referee's mic?
I don''t care what that rule states. That''s a catch and interception. He had possession touched inbounds and kept the ball under control. I know that''s not the rule but that''s how I feel
r/prequelmemes
You can''t logically tell me that he maintained possession of that ball can you?
Papa Nasty x2
PAPAnastos
If that was a receiver they would have called it a TD then maybe reviewed 
Turn in your gun and your badge.
Brb, gonna go make 25 alt accounts to give you an upvote from each one, just for the Twin Peaks reference. 
He definitely didn''t have control 
I get the rule but I mean he has 2 hands on the ball and its pinned against his body 
As a mostly objective Clemson fan: Carolina had a damn good season compared to their projections, and that defense is one of the better ones in the country. Next season, with more Muschamp players, they''ll be scary good.With Debo back and a new OC breathing some life into that offense, i think Carolina competes for the SEC East crown and could be in the national conversation if things go their way.
Fuck, we have to kick?!
Damn I thought he missed for a sec 
B-BUT HE CAUGHT IT /s
Yes and no. Sims sat for 3 years before he got to play which made a difference as well.
In lieu of a review both teams have selected a champion to fight.In the white corner, #48 of Alabama....
WhAt Is A cAtCh
I probably would've called it an interception but it was definitely close. I'm happy about it though
Catch according to the 10 drunk guys at the bar, but not according to the current rule book.
That's a dumb rule. If you maintain possession, it should be counted. 
Shit it''s hard o beat Bama and the refs!
Would you like a cross?
Can't believe this is a one score game
I just find it amusing the ref called it incomplete without even knowing where the fucking ball was.
True
If he had just held it to his dick that would have been a catch. 
Not a catch. I am loving this review process right now. The last two reviews haven't tried to over analyze and get the play "correct." They've just looked to see if it is obviously wrong. That is how replay should work. 
Issa ballgame boys
odd how they have reviewed every close play for uga but none for bama
I want to say INT, but I can't make that call.
That looked awfully close
Why aren''t they going for the block?
I do not trust this shifty ass kicker. 
Blatant hasn't really meant much so far with these officials. 
This game does not feel as close as it is.
We got a game folks 
What if I told you.... 
Hot take. 
Nope I agree correct call
But it didnt look like a catch are you kidding me??? He fucking juggled it lmao. keep being bias though.
Get glasses. 
Pappanastos is a funny name. 
hiphopanonymous makes the kick!
Good call.
Nope, not a catch. Not close.
Do you need to be in complete control of the ball for interception too?
Miss it noonan
Why was it outside?
I can only assume this guys nickname is Papa Nasty
Remember: you must catch the ball with both hands, have 2 feet in-bounds, land a backflip, and smack a cheerleaders ass. 
[deleted]
Georgia has to score here.
If Urban Meyer was this cut throat with his starting QB this year, OSU would be playing right now.Oops, did I say that out loud?
I haven't seen a show this entertaining since the premiere performance of George Frideric Handel's Ariodante at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden ***this very day*** on 1735!
I see you!
I've seen this game before. How does it go MSST?
damn that angle was shitty
And that is how they cheat...
Every conceivable call has gone Bamas way
Nice flair ;)
Timeout Georgia. This is a 19-minute timeout. Their first of the half. 
Authentic NFL catch ruling here
Here comes the inevitable comeback 
Would love to see it stand, but there's not a chance in hell it will.
Great fucking call. Of course the big ten refs have their best game of the season in an all SEC matchup.
Don''t you mean the AT&T Pylon Cam brought to you by AT&T? Don''t wanna get sued there. 
Andy Pappanastos sounds like the owner of a steakhouse 
You're right, I'm not your dad.
Bama....Made two field goals?Is that even legal?
Call me crazy, but I think Bama should be playing the sophomore who is #2 in TDs all time in Alabama history. The problem isn't the QB. The problem is Smart absolutely fucking owns Daboll tonight. 
this is going to OT isn't it
Time for another score bulldogs!
So damn close. Hell of a play
Give the make up call!!!!
Everytime I use watchEPSN I can''t believe how fucking awful it is. Can''t watch the game either 
im watching the skycam stream on espns site with no issues, and no subscription. try move to that? its working great and no annoncers
upvote
As a SDSU/Oregon fan I know my team won't be there any time soon
Dumb hicks? Really?
Common sense would tell you that''s a pick but then again “maintaining possession” is kinda like looking for the lochness at this point. 
Speak for yourself
You could if it never bobbled right?
Nah, you gotta complete the catch. 
Lol. You're fucking blind
Someone hold me 
The natty is a one TD game in the 4th quarter. Here we fucking go
Dawgs need to grind out some first downs.
There is A LOT of football to play. 
lmfao do people not know what a catch is? don't let your hate of Alabama deter your football knowledge. 
I don't know about you guys, but field goals and punts is what I came here to watch.
I like you 
That's the right call. 
thank the beer I've been drinking
That bama redhead cheerleader though
I have an all-you-can-eat at Whataburger bet with a friend so I''m gonna need Fromm to drive for a TD here
Wish Tua would have been in all game:/
he shouldn't have jumped
i can see them calling that either way, i didnt think he caught it though
we all know that would have been a touchdown if he had a white jersey on
Bullshit.
My argument for it not being an interception: He used his knees to bobble it as it was slipping from his hands.
Georgia's  head coach looks like the get your Dr. Pepper guy with a visor.
Wasn't pretty. But it's in. 
Fuck auburn 
Being in the championship and losing is much more impressive than never getting to it. It's hilarious to see people bring that shit up over and over when their team didn't even have a chance to lose. 
Auburn lol
Thanks for reminding me of all the ways Georgia beat us. *drinks*
Oh great it''s this awful basketball faced woman
He literally didn't have control how were people calling that a catch? Lol.
It just means more ok
I don't see how the receiver being wrapped up prior to contact with the ball didn't count as pass int? 
Horse shit call
That missed touchdown by jalen on the first drive really hurts right now
Georgia, I'mma need more points from you now.
Looking like this one is going to be a nail biter...
You mean except for the part where he clearly lost it, right
He tossed it back up to himself while in the air. 
And the Falcons should've won the Super Bowl..Sigh
It was actually good, you're probably just an older country music guy tho 
I just wanna see these young, young freshman share the balls but these fucking refs man!
this qb throws a lot better than Hurts
uh
8min drive with TD plz
We absolutely need points on this drive.
I'm getting super bowl feelings and I don't like it 
Don''t let the result of this championship game distract you from the fact that the Falcons blew a 28-3 lead in the Super Bowl
That is the right call.  He lost possession of it.
#BIGDICKPROBLEMS
doink it
Wasn't that DPI?
Dawgs getting screwed by the refs
If he kept it pinned, it would have counted. It's cause he let go of it 
certainly not **ball moving in the air with hands on either side not touching it**
Yes
Pass plays and give Sony the ball for runs. He's the only one of our backs doing work tonight
Still hope!
Overtime folks?
[deleted]
100% confirmed. indisputable evidence he bobbled the ball then landed out of bounds
As in no more carries in this game...
This is a great national championship game 
Yay! More commercials... said no one ever.
Shutting off a championship game early for the first time because I have to get up at 5am for work...getting old sucks, kids. I advise against it. 
It feels like Georgia is up by 20
Why didn't Helfrich recruit Tua. What an idiot
OMG, bulldogs please get a TD here.
Totally a pick.  Fuck these refs.
Well. Here we go.
I see this whats a catch bullshit is hitting the cfb too
A FG and TD by Bama may give you overtime and you'll get your wish
Or, just control it and not bobble it like he did
And one foot  inbounds
that first lady's face paint in the chik fil a commercial lmfao wow
I like trucks, Auburn sucks.
ANDYYY
G
Is this in Illinois?
No it's not. He bobbled it and didn't have possession till he was out of bounds. how should that be a catch?
the most overrated football player of all time who none of us would have ever heard of if he played in any other NFL city? Yeah.
Just a reminder LSU plays both of these teams at home next year. *drink*
LETS GO GEORGIA BROS YOUVE GOT THIS! 
O N E S C O R E G A M ENESCOREGAME
Damn. He had it too. But I guess it's instinct to adjust. Ah well.
is this a joke
Fuck these refs 
I really don't see how people could think that was an interception.
Only fitting a dong catch would seal the game for us, but good call.
[deleted]
Maybe we just get to call him winner later today 
I wouldn''t exactly call it “pinned” when it''s fingertips and he has to bobble to secure it. 
Why are you showing this commercial now? No one cares 
ANDY PAPPANASTY
Baw Gawd! That's Jalen Hurts' music!
dont fuck this up papanasty
ROBBED
God what an idiot.
Damn I shoulda been a wide receiver
Yes.
Yes 
Why fuck UCF?
no because he was in the endzone on the catch. if he was out of the endzone and ran into it then yes
Fair. 
That woman with the face paint hasn't been within 100 yards of a college lecture.
I'm so sick of this Auburn Georgia commercial
I am Pac-12 ref. That's an interception and a first down in the 40 yard line. 
TIL: I do not want to be a WR for Alabama....
And survive the ground 
 This commercial is outdated
B1G refs want bama. You''d think they''d be salty. 
O
Sounds like a challenge. 
Go Owls.
yeah. 25-3 now ;)
This
but then he lost control
Yeah, they thought I was weird before. Now they think I'm a crazy east coast lunatic for sure!
Crazy that the SEC kickers are actually good now. Guess they learned from that LSU/Bama kicking nightmare.
Trent Richardson, Eddie Lacy, Derrick Henry, Bo Scarborough, and now Najee Harris?So. Many. Dreadlocks.Did I forget anyone?
*Alabama kicking*“Just a 30 yarder”L. O. L. 
Nah, that's not an interception. The catch rules are dumb like that. The fact that he readjusted lost it for him, the dumb thing is that if he had kept it pinned against his knee the whole way it would have been a pick easily. 
Even the drunk guys should be able to tell it's incomplete.
?? Shit was incomplete at any levelFuck outta here
Do not become a meme UGA
Georgia just needs a score and that''s a wrap.
HA. FUCK AUBURN
Hell of an effort by Sanders, made it look close.
that's...what she said?
That bothered me too. 
If that's how the rule worked, almost every dropped pass would count. 
Lol if that's the case then he ought to be a Heisman worthy player. We might need to keep him. 
It's moving all over the place, he doesn't have control
Agreed
You mean a touchback? Your comment makes no sense.
Good ol mel Tucker. One of the worst DC's the Bears have ever had.
With the Money in the Bank Briefcase
If Alabama wins we riot
Is my heart supposed to be hopping around on the floor? 
What is the story behind Georgia and Auburn?
I honestly don't know what a catch is anymore
Do refs in all conferees have some fucked up agreement to favor bama in every call possible?
Miss it Papastamos
[crazy angle that shows he caught it in bounds what the fUCK!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)
They shouldn''t, it wasn''t a pick.
Yes
yeah saw that on the replay and commented in-thread about it. 
Don't let them do it dawgs
I wonder if next year Saban will recruit an Air Raid style quarterback just in case.
Reminder-Actors are not real people.
Ha he does
Its not pinned. It floats for a short moment
That's a pretty generous interpretation of that play.
Papa Nasty!!
He didn't retain full possession as he went out of bounds though.
Damn, this is a crazy game. Bama players acting like asses, players passing out. Let's just get out alive people.
fix fix fix fix hahahhajajajajajaj555555
I'm gonna throw up
HE DOESNT LOSE THE BALL HES FRICKIN JUMPING. 
So he caught the ball. Yup. He stepped in bounds after catching the ball. Yup. He kept the ball from dropping the ballYupSo it was an interception... No...
We got a TD on a close call
Lol. Yes. Yes they did
How did refs not call penalty for stopping bama from getting a touchdown? Blatant
They''re kinda like the Seahawks. They hold a little on every play so the refs can''t keep calling it 
To whoever asked why Georgia didn't go for 2 on their last TD, this is why.
I bet Pappanastos curves to the left. 
PEOPLE IN THE SOUTH DEFINITELY ASK MY NORTHERN-MICHIGAN-ACCENTED ASS WHERE I'M FROM JUST SAYING
LMAO, trying to make Bama out to be the third wheel.
Could they have pleased picked someone else to rep AU other than the crazy cat lady? Asking for a friend 
Fuckin hope not it''s a work night 
Yep, wife pointed that out live. Glad she didn't get knocked down.
Catch rules are so dumb. He didn't bobble it, he readjusted the ball. There was never doubt that he would hang on to the ball. I don't know the solution, but something needs to change on catch rules.
Lets fucking go defense!
Is the Bama Auburn rivalry over? Is it all about the Georgia Auburn rivalry now?
Which always seems to bode well for the team that''s down, for some reason
Never totally had control until he already was entirely off the ground
Living in the south, no one has ever asked me where i was fromOr who i was forOr even talked to me at all
It's still deeply unsettling to listen to deep southern drawls talk about how different groups shouldn't mix based on their color associations
Who's your bigger rival? Tech or Auburn?
It will happen! In this stupid ass commercial 
This is the longest game ever. I just want to go to bed. 
You can, though. If he'd kept it pinned there, he might've gotten the call.
Lets go, Dawgs, don't fuck this up!
[Obligatory "Auburn Sucks" music post.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m6Sw26gUQo)
Guys...I'm not ready for CFB to end.
“People don''t ask ya where ya from they ask ya who ya for”
These rival commercials are so cringey
I come to live feeds just for comments like this sometimes 
I don't think many UGA fans would think it should be called a pick but are wanting some balance from other missed calls
So does this mean we get to keep saying it?
Yeah, it''s gotta be complete control.
lmao if you think thats a catch, I can't help you
Dude there was no way that was a catch
[deleted]
It blows my mind how slow "the worldwide leader in sports" is to adapt to technology. They wouldn't have lost as much revenue if they'd just offered standalone stellar streaming service that was reliable and good by 2014 like every other industry leader in programming. WatchESPN as a standalone service if it was as good as HBOgo or Netflix would fetch $20/month easy.
You absolutely can catch with your groin.
Good lord everyone is whining about the refs favoring Bama, but it isn't actually happening at all.  Just a bunch of people who don't understand football.
Only the Lord's food could bring together Auburn and Georgia
This is so dumb wtf we always tailgate with other teams. Off the field we're bros.
Or just have complete control while in bounds. That wasn't really that close to an interception.
Gotta suck for Jalen Hurts.   Benched during the NCG, but he's handling it like a pro.  
bruh why they gotta show a commercial about AUBURN during this game
Surprised it wasn''t called as an Alabama TD.
Papa Nachos, actually. 
But he took his hands off of it to adjust his hold and wasn''t inbounds when he grabbed it again. 
BOBBLED
Hot Take: I still haven't spoken to one of my uncles since the Kick-Six.
AUBURN WE ARE DONE WITH YOU GET OFF MY SCREEN.
That was as much of a catch as the one earlier when the Georgia receiver hit out of bounds and the ball came loose. 
Okay Georgia, burn 7-8 minutes going down the field to get a score.
This commercial needs to die 
This is the only good commercial on the night
 Our pizza joint
I hate this commercial they make it seem like they''re doing a real public service but instead they''re just eating chick fil a lmao get outta here 
Damn this game is really not about to be over before midnight. Fuck these long ass commercials!
Should've kept it against his thigh
 Why do the refs H8 us so much
it's only a matter of time
The Ref that called it incomplete didn't even know where the ball was.
Wrong Alabama team CFA
Too much time left. Bama wins
We only like football uhround heyuh
Plz no I work tomorrow morning
Watching for a fake fg.
No he didn't he bobbled that and didn't have full possession till he was out. Don't be a homer 
I''d tailgate with UW fans if they were giving me chick-fil-a 
weak ass rivalry, also fake tigers
Ref didn't see the bobble, and what if bama had snapped it? No review call?
Auburn-Georgia has nothing on Ohio State-Michigan.
Look at all the southerners...
SHOOEY SHUNGABAIFUCKIT
There have been some confusing rules about what constitutes ‘a catch,'' but this was pretty obviously not one. Guy was still honking it as he flew outta bounds. No catch 
Thighception ruined
[deleted]
Saban will make it legal
They should award the championship to UCF if the game is tied at the end of regulation imo
He should be kicked out of the game, but to me, it didn''t look like he swung at him. He used his helmet and gave the coach a kind of a push to instigate as he was yelling at him. It wasn''t really a swing or a punch. 
God damn he tried to karate chop his throat. 
That''s not how rivalries work. 
God damn it really flew by this year.
That wasn't a catch though?
Flair up, and don''t give me the “im on mobile” excuse. Its not hard
At least Chick Fil A got an actual rivalry for this commercial and not the fictional storied FSU-Bama rivalry
The commentators have the nerve to say, "it's been a very well officiated game".
I keep saying he should open a chain of pizza restaurants.
You take this shit too seriously.  It's reddit - people make jokes about other teams.  It happens.
Crazy to think about. Georgia was in position at Alabama''s 40 to go up by 3 Possessions and then it turned all of sudden 
I'd eat Chick-fil-a with Hitler, I don't give a fuck
nice commercial
That's bullshit.  It was touching his body the whole time with at least a little pressure.  He never really lost possession after he pinned it to his leg.
Wouldve much rather seen that little girl scream "WAR DAMN EAGLE"
Seems like he didn't lose control,  but rather purposefully repositioned it.... 
lol Auburn
dick pick
It is? Oh, I guess I don't know the lyrics that well then
Chick-fil-a solving world peace.
Now do this for the Iron BowlLets see how many people die 
how cute, chick fil a brought you guys together!
I, for one, welcome our commercial overlords.
He fucks
Yes
And landed out of bounds after he go the ball under control. 
This game is pretty good.
Cringey AF
Can they stop airing this commercial? The SEC Championship was over a month ago.
I'm with you dawg, whether we like it, here it id3 heart attacks already 
Fans tailgate together at literally every game, as long as you're not a complete fucking tool
Imagine having to beat Bama AND the refs on the same night. 
During the Rose Bowl I was being driven mad by constantly hearing Boomer Sooner.
This chick fil a commercial was relevant a few weeks ago. But they just keep playing it.
That's a real nice chick fil a ad 
how many relatives can you fit in one commercial 
Is that rivalry really that big of a thing 
[deleted]
So if he had caught it one handed with a foot in bounds, would that have been an interception? 
Lol Chic fil A
That was an interception. Fuck the refs 
This is such an SEC game. As in, it's boring as fuck. Field goals and punts. Woo.
Chickfila needs to stick to sammiches
You really think that was a catch? 
It hurts so much 
You'd think UGA would have a much bigger lead than they do given how this game has went.
ESPN radio host just said, "a well officiated game"
Chik fil a acting like they've curing cancer
Who would win the commercial playoff? 
The pregame O/U looking on point
That made me laugh.
In the blue corner. Alabama coaches. 
twss
Can''t they just leave us alone with these commercials 
Bama coming back.C'mon DAWGS!  Fucking do something!
New way to review if it''s a catch: show the video to a panel of three 6 year olds, majority opinion wins.
[deleted]
How''s 2005
Lol at a Georgia Auburn commercial during the Georgia Alabama game
Thanks Chick-fil-A, I really wanted a longer version of that commercial.
Could bamas kicker be anymore greek?
LIVIN IN THE SOUTH
What is you best example of "*it just means more *" tonight?
How did you deal with the bowl game this year? 
so this is what cocaine feels like?
This Chik-fil-a commercial is despicable 
It bothers me how the put Georgia on the left and Auburn on the right in that ad
Auburn fans don't bathe
Not a catch. 
D
They paid actors to get that done lolz.
I don't have a good feeling for Georgia about the end of this game at all.
I fucking hate it 
This commercial is so stupid I've seen tons of Auburn and Georgia fans tailgating when we play.
The viewer and commercials are like two rivals balling
That Chick fil A thing seems like such a waste of time 
We figured out a way to bring Auburn and Georgia fans together: mall food court chicken!
The worst rule in all of football. Gets feet in bounds and the ball never touches the ground yet somehow it's not a fucking catch. They need to fix the rulebook. 
SMH HIS NAMES LARRY GET IT RIHGT MAN!!-
Hurts just wasn't moving the ball.
IT what you doin friend?!
What I'm saying is that was definitely not dirty...  I don't know what other games you have in mind (prolly didn't watch em)... But that play wasn't dirty
[deleted]
Really got to be alert for surprise onside kick here.
The problem is Saban has a god complex and nothing can ever be his fault.
This would be the most Georgia sports way to lose since the Falcons.
Thanks Kirk Herbstreit /s
Auburn did, and beat them both. Yet here we are...
I'm getting to the bottom of how to say it one beer at a time. 
Holy shit, the mullet on Mike Gundy.Goddamn, that's impressive.
with all of these calls the b1G refs might as well chant"WE WANT BAMA"
I want this to go to OT. I don''t want CFB to end
Big if true
I didn't notice
Chick-fil-a fixed racism
Did you guys hear that Auburn lost to the national champs?
[deleted]
If you whine hard enough daddy will buy you a pool -whatever the fuck this ponzi scheme is
That''s what I took from this!
Nobody talking about the fact that the guy was tackling him as he jumped to catch it
Miss me with this segregation Chik Fil A what the fuck
Chick Fil A 2nd best fast food jointDon't @ me
We coming back baby. 
Don''t want to take a penalty to give bama a first I bet
Auburn-Georgia commercial is a bit late
*insert "become a meme" button*
Me neither. Let''s hug
He was bobbling it the entire time and by the time he caught it he was out of bounds. This isn't one of those weird ass NFL surviving the ground type shit. This was blatantly obvious and makes sense.
Coach''s film room is great. 
If I was Georgia and they lost this game I'd burn the stadium to the ground after all those missed penalties and botched offside punt penalty. Just saying. 
Pretty weird they're talking about a Georgia-Auburn rivalry and not Alabama-Auburn 
It seems like they''re always really hesitant to call pi in the end zone, despite how obvious it is
Hey look, a commercial about Auburn. In a game their two rivals are playing in, that is for the co-national title.
First time I saw this commercial. I thought that was cool.
Since they have cams in them being back like that gives them a good view to see if someone is in or not in front of those cams, instead of being too close to see or interfere in a play.
I agree but I also got downvoted for my joke so I''m just gonna not comment anything else on the subject lol
Yeah we fixed rivalry tailgating problems a long time ago with beer and brats. 
Gameday wouldn't be the same without each other. So, in the nicest way possible, fuck you Iowa. 
This game will go to OT and end at 2am 
I guess nobody told chik-fil-a ...
The guy that fell out on the sideline. Same guy that went after a coach?
well wasn't that a nice comercial
I'm not even invested in that rivalry and that was an abomination
The gold Georgia logo looks like the Green Bay Packers logo.... I wish we were in the playoffs.
Auburn Georgia was a month ago and 2 months ago. There should be a limit to how many times you can show the exact same commercials.
What''s your chic fil a order? I''m all about that spicy chicken. 
That is the nicest rivalry I have ever seen
DAAADDAA
That replay clearly showed pass interference, come on r/cfb, but Bama gets all the calls.
Saban with a hood on: "I will make it legal."
Which is ironic since he will def not be a pro.
Wasn''t even close to a catch lol
I like college Football. College football is my favorite sport When I see college football on I say “yes” When I see something that''s not college football on I say “no” 
me neither.
We''re one of the like top 3 most played rivalries in the country
By calling plays correctly?
D
Spend $20,000 so your shitty kids will like you.
Chick fil a lives up to the hype.But honestly when it comes to In & Out or What-A-Burger I'd rank them behind Cookout.
No they didnt.
I don't think it's close at all. he bobbled it until he was out of bounds. if he was a WR, would anyone call that TD? 
Little does that dad know his kids won't think shit of that pool after a month
You would be surprised. I had a professor with a southern accent thicker than that.
Well he''s 19, so.........
They rarely get hit in the face. 
That's a weird commercial considering fans tailgate together, ya know, every single game.
Petition to nickname Andy Pappanastos as Andy Pappa Nasty
The worst part is the stock music to act like it''s inspirational or some shit
This off season gonna suck ass 
What a dramatic chick fil a commercial, acting like they solved world peace. 
i knew there was no way some cherry red wearing team would actually win. alabama has this in the bag
In all likelyhood he fainted due to heat, or locking his knees. Shit happens A LOT in the services. Ive personally seen it at least two dozen times
I remember one of the greatest catches in history was an Alabama player trapping the ball against an apposing player's back. 
Yeah but you can''t let go of the ball and then catch it again out of bounds, he didn''t have possession.
This is turning out to be a good game after all
That's not how hot takes work
and yet he was still correct
lol no
"Down her they don't ask where you're from they ask who you're for".No, that doesn't happen very often. People most definitely ask where you're from.
If I'm Georgia, I run run run.  Dance with the girl that brought ya.Please don't tho.
I'm sorry Georgia, I can see the writing on the wall. The refs are going to fuck you out of a natty so Spoiled bama fans can have another one. 
Says the fan of a team that''s also watching this game from their couch.
It's times like that, that remind me. Fuck you Michigan,  i will never eat Chic fil a with you
Lol, with all the production they put into that commerical the turnout was low as fuck. Chick-fil-a underestimated the depth of SEC hate.
Except he didn't, it bobbled around yes, but he never dropped it and never was going to drop it. Ever. So dumb.
Lmao get over it snowflake
Big series coming up. This is big time.
100% knew this was a troll but I had to click anyway
Nah
Swish
Was she in a dancing dress?
Guys I just played a 99 point word in Words with FriendsEdit: [Proof](https://i.imgur.com/hql0pp2.png)The word was feeders. Not a very strong word, but it covers two triple word bonuses
Mike Gundy looks like he should be playing in the NHL
Dead
Pulling for you, bulldog bros
No, its dumb in both leagues. It would have been a pick if he kept it on his thigh but because he readjusted it doesn't count? That's dumb 
Truth about football is that folks tailgate with rivals every fuckin week. You're not special, company.
ay yo anybody got any of them true freshmen up in here
You're probably right..
Can't tell if pun intended or unintended, but here, take my upvote anyway
I have no horse in this race.  The ball was clearly moving and in possession as he was going out of bounds.  Not a catch.
It's the reshuffling of the ball in the hands that rules it incomplete, I think.
Don't you put that evil on us
Last years final was nearly 5 hours long...
not sure what game you're watching if you think its boring
Certainly hope so, I dislike you guys (respectfully) but trust the coaching staff to deal with that kinda shit swiftly and kick him out. Saban et all are the best because they don't put up with shit no matter how good you are
Whatever. I watch games with auburn alabama and Tennessee fans. No biggie chick fil a. Don't need you
I''m more likely to be asked where I go to church, not who I''m for or where I''m from. 
[deleted]
lmao right
Nah there was some bullshit early 3rd but it''s been at least competent otherwise imo
So you forgot the "offsides" and the facemask that Alabama then scored next possession?
This pool commercial is the dumbest commercial I've seen in a long time.....
Nice attitude. She should be cutting the lawn
Nah man, all the cool schools are doing it, join us.
It''s an old commercial from the SEC championship 
Not with Auburn fans were not
Chick fil a unites us all. 
Welcome to /r/cfb
Well sorry for having defense, we understand the PAC isn't big on that
...we can?
If my daughter mouthed off to me like that I'd backhand her.
That was blatantly not a catch by any definition
Any longhorns looking to get Chikfila? wait does that still count?
Chicken and Pepsi can save the world...
Can you take me to Jessicas house?
That is a dope ass pool
Video plx
Same dude.  Basketball is my drug to hold me over until next season.
You forgot where he just says Notre Dame for no reason.
Yup
*2015onsidekickintensifies*
Anyone that thinks you can momentarily pin the ball between three fingers and your crotch and have that count as possession are crazy. That has always been and will always be considered a bobble as he's going out of bounds.
Please get Tim tebow off my screen
That was kinda cool chickfila
Agreed 
"The best offense is defense"
A
Ah yes, pools are great financial investments.
this is the same situation in which Alabama kicked an onside kick in the '16 National Championship (January '16). Watch out. 
If bama wins georgia is going to go on suicide watch
Make chicken great again
Whats /#1?
WE GET IT CHIK FIL A
WOW ugh 
Right call on review, but how the hell did the ref see it on the field from that position?
The Ref that called it incomplete didn't even know where the ball was.
48 totally took a swing at a coach, I want to know what happens to him.
He missed the middle aged coach with his swing after punching a helmet.. I want a repick.
How dare they make the right call!!Also, flair up
Good food. Bad policy.
Great camera AT&T 
Do we want OT guys? 
There it is
Finally, someone sane
You look dumb to me
No, I won't drive you to Jessica's house. Pick up a shovel and get to fucking work
Can you drive me to Jessica's house?No you obnoxious bitch.
Username checks out
No
you lying sack of shit
Pump the brakes, kid.
Well it made sense in the SECCG
I'm from south Georgia and I couldn't understand half of the people in that Chickfila commercial
Auburn
Your flair and comment do not compute
That's what I'm saying, the two big catches leading to Bama's touchdown should have both been reviewed!
The catch rules are good. They are clear and concise.
A
Dude, if you can just up and build a pool in your backyard, you aren't mowing your own lawn with a push mower. 
Fucker
gotta love all of the "IF BAMA DID DIS HUR HUR HUR" statements being tossed around. The anti-bama circle jerk over like one actually missed call (the facemask) is fucking gold to watch.
Auburn.
What's a computer?
Thanks guys wasn't sure, knew it had to be for a regular catch. Definitely wasn't in complete control of that then. 
It's okay the subreddit already gave them a trophy. Nothing but respect for MY national champion.
Fuck you, Chick-Fil-A.Auburn-Georgia rivalry isn't like that at all.  They tailgate together every fucking year.Now *Bama* on the other hand...  Fuck em.
Drive her to Jessica's house for a few bucks and minutes or spend weeks and thousands of dollars building a pool?
It's like watching a slow crash, can't look away.  How is Georgia going to fuck this up?  
Fuck chick fil a
It''s hard getting along with the in laws 
I hate em worse than Bama if that helps you
He got an MBA from Tennessee. He only made it worse.
Creepy ass dad just trying to get a bunch of teenage girls in bikinis at his house. Disgusting
Yes, and they could potentially lose to both.
I''m all for UGA here but he didn''t have possession until he hopped out of the back of he endzone. 
We can not 
Georgia has one good offensive play in the second half.
I'd take that girl to Jessicas house about as soon as I'd put 48 back in the game
Ungrateful daughter is ungrateful.I'll just build her a pool.
All bias aside, if you think that was an INT then you need to read the rulebook. 
[deleted]
I hear that
He''s been shaky anyways, and you give up the three so as not to give up some kind of fake.
Don''t talk shit about Chick Fil A. It''s much more than food court chicken. 
We in the Big 10 approve.
Can we put Jalen and Tua in at the same time and just direct snap to either we feel like?
This consolation match sure is exciting!
THANK YOU
Chick-fil-A beats cookout any day. 
If he'd done that, that was a catch.
No
It clearly wasn't a catch according to the rules and the replay showed that, so it was confirmed.
So that Northwestern commercial can go fuck itself... It wont be pool weather here for 5 months.
Nope. Different player
How?! He was juggling it the entire time and only had it secured out of bounds. This isn't one of those weird ass NFL surviving the ground type shit. This was blatantly obvious and makes sense.
Lmao
Tha's the worst part.
If anyone is watching the film room Gundy is a football psycho. I fucking love that guy. I also REALLY want to have a beer with Pat Fitzgerald. What a cool dude.
I agree
Negative
Too true
didn't say it was
Next commercial: Chick Fil A attempts to mediate the Israel-Palestine conflict 
ACCORDING TO BLEACHER REPORT THE NATTY IS OFFICIALLY LIT
Someone trying to do a commercial like that with the Egg Bowl would be interesting....
If there is a God, Dawgs will hold on.
Must make things awkward at the Father-Son Breakfast at Church.
What's cookout?
This has to be one of the worst officiated games. 
That Chic-Fil-A commercial was neat.
Hear Hear!
No, I fucking love chicken sandwiches
I dont think he tried... I think he did.
Dad, can you drive me somewhere? No! I'll spend tens of thousands of dollars on a pool instead.
Lol surprising comment with those flairs.But yea. Uga is getting away with a lil, so are we. Refs damned when their harsh, damned when they let em play.
Hahaha I appreciate it man! I'm a HUGE NBA fan and a little part of me dies inside every time she's involved with a game. She's horrible. 
Tim Tebow is such a good sport 
Christ what a bad commercial that chic fil a was. Makes me want to blow my brains out
GTHOM
And the replay officials who confirmed it, did. He switched hands while out of the field of play.  It was a good call.
that seems like a reasonable tradeoff .. 
These damn b1g refs.
He really is terrible :/
it's^the^sweet^one 
Lol how did that Chik Fil A stunt not end in several drunken fist fights?
My argument for it being an interception: He had so much control, he purposely bobbled it to show off.
Why don't you have a seat over there...
Still have not been to Cookout.  Never heard any recommendations for it (good/bad/otherwise).  I take it you're a fan?
Also that missed facemask against bama was huge.
Alabama wildcard and Auburn beats Georgia 6/10 times...so no?
>Being from the South, people don't ask where ur from, they ask who ur for.Lol what?  
What's up?
Pic?
I don't think there are any actual QBs on Bama's roster. If they had anyone with any accuracy they'd be up by 14.
"The ruling on the field is *MOOOOOOOOM HE'S TOUCHING ME*!"
You're my national champ, btw
NO
the nice thing about streaming is no commercials, just a nice, peaceful silence.
Tebow is a shitty driver. 
No
@
YOU TAKE THAT BACK
The fourth quarter thread moves so fast nobody will know I cried the first time I saw that chick-fil-a commercial 
How the hell does Tebow still have commercials?
Georgia?
Panal of 10 moms
No please, I need to sleep.
Ah ok. That makes sense. Thanks. 
The dad just built the pool so he could creep on his daughter's friends
Let's go 3OTs
Hey Chik Fil A is manna from the heavens. 
In my heart (not by rule) that''s truly a catch . He secured it in bounds and then when he readjusted it adjusted to better position if control all before any other foot landed
Lol no, Raekwon Davis is our champion. 6''7” 300.
If he didn't reset it he had it. Falls forward with the ball trapped on his leg and it's Georgia ball. 
I kind of agree. But I also think the ground should be able to cause a fumble, so my opinions on rules might be questionable. 
You''re in the wrong place to say the refs gave Georgia a break
lmfao it's an obvious joke
That's why I played tennis 
On a scale from hula hoop to making diamonds, how clenched are y''all Bama fans'' buttholes?
CAN YOU TAKE ME TO JESSICA''S HOUSE? _dadlike glance_UGHHHHH
I'll never totally understand the south's full time obsession with chik fil a. It's delicious, but like a a cultural cornerstone thing
probably the only good commercial all night
Lil sweeeeet
I like this commercial about Georgia and Auburn fans- they are brought together by their mutual losing to Clemson and Alabama Loser bros for life!
Same here. Once it hits the stadium though, all bets are off
Just Bama Things
I mean it''s nice of them bringing together the players of the consolation title after hosting the natty for UCF
It's better than the NFL
He didn't have control of the ball.
Are you stupid
He left his wife for his mistress.
I was just trying to hope :( saw a clear angle right after I posted comment
I like how in Alabama, auburn and Alabama fans like legit hate each other lmao. In Michigan it''s a rivalry but nothing like it is down there lol
These Northwestern Mutual ads have been all over the fucking place 
Looks like Kirby made a deal with the devil that is finally coming back to bite him
Build a money sink with 3 kidsSolid financial advising northwest
Gundy looks high as shit. 
Georgia NEEDS a field goal here. 
We still have our Spring Game to look forward to in April
Not the worst I've ever seen. As long as it's not that NHL bullshit where the large and small drinks are actually the same size.
I think I'll refrain from having children just to keep the word "DAAAAAAAIIIDDUH" from ever being directed at me. 
BUT DAD!!! 
Are they side burns if they don''t connect to his hair line? 
Dr. Pepper can go fuck itself 
Ah yes, “let''s make catches more subjective!”
Telling me you can't get a grilled cheese as a side? Nah I'm going to cookout 
I get a 12pc nuggets with large fry and medium drink, cause they can always refill the drink for free 
Welcome to football lol. If the refs aren''t screwing you, then you complain about how they have before and you''re surprised they aren''t now. 
Georgia-Auburn is literally called “The Deep South''s Oldest Rivalry”
One G must win it all this year. 
Care to support that assertion with any backing?
Fuck you as well sir
True. No flags or warnings for bama
Always
Ues
I feel like Tebow would have run over the mascot without the car intervening 
Could someone explain the ruling of that incomplete pass/interception?
Didn''t matter, it wasn''t a catch.
No way lol my heart can''t take it and I''m not even a regular fan of either of these teams 
Alabama's overabundance of mascots is oddly enraging
I believe!!!
You''re not mowing your own lawn at all
the only time i ate at Cookout I was in the hospital for food poisoning the next day. 
No. Different guy but happened shortly after that incident 
WatchEspn is soooo fuckin bad
Are all Bama games like this? You guys win these close games because the refs are scared of saban or some shit? This is so hard to watch...4-5 atrocious calls, about 4 noncalls, and about 10 blatant holds not called. Honestly. Wtf.
Me irl
Spicy chicken sandwich, no pickle, all day every day
Uh no.  Chick-fil-a is the best. 
I like how that commercial implies Tebow wanted to straight demolish the guy in the elephant suit
THIS IS ALMOST OVER WHAT ARE YOU DRINKING?
Free food
You can''t bobble the ball out of bounds
except he tried to readjust the ball and when he did, his feet were out of bounds
Yeah it''s just his fucking neck. Who cares, right?
Goddamnit, now I want some Chick-Fil-A
Eat a dick Buckeye.I agree.
Did he jinx the FG attempt? Or did you just pick a random family member to ostracize after it happened?
They know we are powerless to their shit. 
Agreed.
at least that Apple “what''s a computer” commercial hasn''t come on yet.
What an unappreciative little shit
UGA kickers have always been stellar. 
No. Different guy.
Hey, chic-fil-a might just be the best damn chicken sandwich out there.
I'm convinced Tebow wants to kill that elephant 
Fuck fuck fuck fuck 
Georgia is gonna join the Pac-20 in 2122. Go Georgia!!
I'd rather have zaxby's
checking in, fuck bama
In the Red corner, wearing Silver ~~Britches~~ Trunks, tag-teamed by Terrible Trenton Thompson, its Rowuan! Shut Down! SMIIIIIIIIIITHHHHHH!
Nice username. I met Isaac last May.
Wut? I love Chick-fil-A
I left sad and then I was happy and then I was sad 
Easy fix for the catch rule:  completely forget "control."  If you catch the ball at any point inbounds and prevent it from hitting the ground, it's a damn catch.  Who fucking cares if you bobble it or bounce it off your torso for a split second, if you're coordinated enough to prevent it from hitting the ground that's impressive enough and deserves credit.
Lol, I just told my wife the same thing. No one has ever asked me that.
He didnt keep possession? He juggled it out of bounds
You're a total homer or don't know football if you think that was a catch. He bobbled and didn't have control until he was out of bounds 
R
I'm from the East Coast, but the In-N-Out outside of LAX blew my mind the first time I had it.
Yes
I'll take it, just run a long, clock-chewing drive and get a td pls. 
His anger was more important than a national title game, good luck staying on Saban''s team. 
would prob work
For reference: not that near interception. He never had control of the ball in-bounds.
Right, holds are *defintley* legal. 
He ain't my daddy but he my papa. 
He caught the ball in bounds, got his foot in and moved it into a different position. I mean come on, you've got to be delusional to think that shouldn't be a pick. I get the catch rules, but it's not like he hit the ground, bobbled it all over and all that. He clearly was coming down with that regardless.
Let''s be real here.  Chick fil A isn''t the rivalry restaurant for UA and UGA.  It''s more like Waffle House. 
Tim was tryna hit the elephant
I love me some sports ball! 
Nah bro that's Pepsi 
With Pepsi
I remember 2009
Seriously. I mean we play it up sometimes, and there are definitely some fans that take shit too far, but for the most part people are still cool with each other. 
Anything. That shit is like crack. Not a fan of waffle-fries though but I don''t hate them either.
That was definitely incomplete
2nd to none 
But he didn''t control the ball until he was already out of bounds. The rule is fine 
Fuck Nissan. I wish I had a GT-R just so I could sell it for a bunch of Vanguard ETFs because fuck Nissan.
Chick fil a is so good... I think it has a chance 
How? The ball clearly came loose. 
he was on on old player tweets and apparently he does bc his twitter name in hs was "jake from state fromm"
The big one always goes in the back.  Which is what she said.
Anyone want a corndog?
Fuck Bama
It's a smart move.  Georgia's entire game plan is based on Hurt playing. 
Just let it go dude. Every unbiased viewer agrees that it wasn''t a catch. He secured possession in the air and landed out of bounds. 
In & Out > Cook Out > What-A-Burger
Ok stop the commercials you greedy fuckers 
This made me laugh
What was the word?
PLOT TWIST
No.
This anti-bama bias in this sub is blatant. 
That''s fine
All i can say is "Lol"
thanks
Nah. Saban seems to be endorsing this shit. Alabama has been playing absurdly dirty all game. 
What was it???
Me 2
If you really think that you haven't been watching. That call on the INT right now was correct but there have been multiple no-calls on Bama and BS calls on UGA.
> So he caught the ball. > Yup. It wasn''t a catch. 
No such thing as make up or balance. Refs just want to get the next one right even if they foul up.The only bad call this game to me is the offsides call on the punt block.
Oh, so your team didn't make it to one? Gotcha. 
Why is it that Bama never seems to get the top tier qb prospects? I would've thought being the best college team would make the best qbs want to go there.
Lil sweet suuuuuucks
Making new super dense matter
Bad driver though.
Is this a question?
I assumed I would turn back into a Clemson feline at midnight. No more barking. 
Decorative pillows and soaps are fucking dumb.
We better get at least two more field goals and three more punts before this game is over
Rome is falling and we're all happy as hell
Because they didn't do it anywhere near either campus
What was it
Well, UGA did beat Auburn in the SEC championship game, but it's a little early to call them the champs. ;P
The deep south''s oldest Rivalry 
Quality Turnover
way to alienate yourself
That girl in the Northwestern Mutual commercial is too good at being obnoxious. I wanna bodyslam her.
Little Jalen had the whole first half to set a tone and he scored nothing. Tough Tua has helped the Tide put 13 points up so far in the second half (almost double Georgia's 7).
3 hour commercial break 
Nothing ever happens in these games until the final minute,.
Even the pillows have pillows. 
Underrated comment ^
My ex wife. 
Yeah, exactly. It's like the person who came up with the ad campaign had no concept of what a tailgate is like, and neither did anyone who signed off on it
In 6 days a week
teenage daughter an awful bitch? build her a pool with your retirement nest egg!
Hey, guys.###I got something to tell you.### You know when I said that I love you?## You've been lied to. 
I had a number 1 no pickle from chick fil a for lunch. Top notch.
Omg
God bless spicy chicken sandwhiches, polynesian sauce, and (of course) Chick-fil-a sauce.
I cringe every time.
No. It's Monday. Tuesday comes next. Tuesday is not a day off. Therefore, this game should end at a reasonable hour.
All i can say is "lol"
Flair up
Hello Auburn!
People hate Alabama so bad they are literally campaigning for a ball that is falling against a defender while in the air to be a catch lol
Fat man interception for the second game in a row for Bama. Our DL has more interceptions than our DBs in the last 2 games...
I''m nervous for no reason 
Clemson guy knows ;)
The only reason this game isn't tied is because the refs gifted Georgia a TD. Lmao.
I don't think you asked a coherent question but if you're asking whether the dude that lost his shit is the same guy that collapsed then no, they are different people. 
Nope never had possession 
these chic-fil-a commercials are so bad... the south loves football but off the field most of 'em are normal folks
I was just saying that
We got called for holding in the first half. I guess the check didn't clear until halftime.
Georgia already is after the Super Bowl last year
It's not a story Nick Saban would tell you
Does anyone else think Mike Gundy is fucking hammed right now on the ESPN film room?
These games start too damn late. I''m tired and I live in mountain time.
They just reusing the commercial from the SEC championship. 
Bling bling
UGHHHGHGHHHHHH
This Dr Pepper commercial makes me so uncomfortable
Subscribe 
No, they don't actually. 
Suck Tua''s 
They've been decent overall, but there have been a few no calls that have been blatant. 
Bruh wut 
I'd go to Chick-Fil-A with anyone are you kidding me? Their food is amazing
ESPN "Milking the fuck outa commercials during the 4th quarter to make this a 12 hour game"
please baby lord jesus, let us pull this out.  please
[deleted]
Link?
30 mins and then no more college football for 8 months.ENNNNNJOY IT
"The big one goes in the back." --She
DaaAAaaAaAaadD!!!
I haven''t talked to your uncle since then, either
I''d generally say Auburn but there''s lots of Tech salt in these threads. So fuck Tech, but I do like driving in my truck. 
No
lil sweet is a national treasure
Fuck off Lil Sweet how did you get in my house
Lil Sweet wants to watch them fuck in the pillows 
The ammount of hatred for Bama is making me wish they comeback just to enjoy the aftermath comments.
Chick Fil A chicken wil bring us together as humans
Florida 
Let's get a cushion here Dawgs 
Shit, how clenched are Georgia fans you mean
Boring big hits, 80 yard YD pass, interceptions...yawn
no sir
No prob Bowl bro 
How many times has he said we've got ourselves a ball game?
Unfortunately not.
Georgia don't blow it
Damn you got a laugh out of me haha
He saw incomplete and was looking to  his sidejudge to see if he saw differently. His incomplete signal is to his co ref
They have to happen at the same time.  Not that complicated.   Otherwise I could run to the locker room batting it from hand to hand and it's a catch?   Nah. 
The bands were playing inside
:)
My feed doesn't have the chik-fil-a ad :(
BearDoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooown?
I SAID DON'T
This being a one possession game now, I'm getting nervous.
Big series coming up. 
Hershel looks like he can play another 10 years in the NFL
Someone is mad they got beat down last week. 
Butt catch should have been incomplete
Ohio is the armpit of America. I fucking hate that state and I have never been there.
When did he lose it? He adjusted to grab it with two hands. He was in control of the ball the entire time
dawgs please
With Kendall Jenner
Ain't got nothin on Wisconsin/Minnesota
Absolutely not 
Not anymore, it's 2018, we're woke now
But the ass smack has to be with your left hand. Right hand smack, it's incomplete
There is a lot of jersey grabbing on both sides (and some of it IS holding, but not all), but I'm glad they're letting them play.
TIL if I would've just been an annoying ass kid, my dad would've built me a pool
I say Bama gets the stop, scores, then Fromm is tested with a game winning/tying drive, then we get OT. 
Perhaps you are new to watching UGA games..... sir, that is not the Georgia way of playing.  =)  please see the Falcons super bowl.
Nah we''re pretty much numb after last years Super Bowl 
[deleted]
How are these Dr. Pepper lil sweet commercials still going? Does anyone like them? I've never met a single person who didn't find those mind-bendingly annoying. It just makes me not want to drink Dr. Pepper ever.
Urban is going for his third title at OSU if he just trusted his RBs and played the throw first QB....
spicy chicken, diet coke, chickfila sauce
What about the offsides call on the blocked punt that was called back?
this game is so long...but I don't mind. think about it.. it'll be another 8 months until we see CFB again :(
Did UGA have Todd Gurley, Nick Cubb, and Michel at one point?
What hair product does every Bama fan use that makes it perfectAsking for a friend
You would think our B1G crew would be out to get Bama for the OSU snub but whatever. Fuck bama anyway
I bet Lil' Sweet can play safety
it wasnt an INT it mighta been PI though
notthat.exe
Yeah I'm surprised Saban didn't make a show out of kicking him out.
What demographic am I a part of where I see that fucking Diet Dr Pepper ad all the time?!
Tua is a top Prospect 
Heat stroke still wouldn't happen in a temp controlled environment. Especially with water/Gatorade everywhere around you. 
Chick-fil-a: We gave rivals free food and have 10 seconds of footage of them not fighting each other. Are you impressed?
Do y'all think it would have been to our benefit if we started Tua the entire game?
Can we got some OT!
I like the Lil' Sweet commercials. Fight me.
No. 
https://www.google.com/amp/s/genius.com/amp/Lynyrd-skynyrd-sweet-home-alabama-lyricsThere you go wiscy bro! Have a good night bud :)
Chik-fil-A: food for football games that don't take place on Sundays
This might be the wrong subreddit but does anyone know why cleaning your ears with a cotton swab feels so good
Georgia has 10:30+ extra over Alabama in TOP and counting. #BigDeal
I grew up in Athens and the Ga Fl rivalry is way bigger than auburn rivalry...
Jfc people it's the same catch rule as the NFL, except one foot instead of two. It is absolutely positively 100% not a catch.
Someone would get shot if they tried this Chik-fil-A thing with Auburn and Bama fans
Seeing the Falcons logo gives me flashbacks...
There might be something to this whole true freshman thing. Our two leading rushers were true freshmen
Auburn let UCF win so the Dawgs would have to share their first natty in decades... don''t @ me
Been getting a little rowdy, nervous if the bartender will serve me another drink. 
Ok if he catches it and gets to feet in and then it''s loose when he goes out of bounds, would that have been a safety?
Agreed. Can you imagine if an Alabama player would have caught it, people would be going apeshit over why it's obviously not a touchdown lol. 
*Computers**1942*???
This Saturday Prime Time commercial can fuck right off.
For real we've had plenty of teams tailgate with us at Clemson.
Sorry for poor English, who ur for?
Then it comes off and he kind of recatches it. I think it would have been confirmed no matter the call, it could have went either way. His right hand never came off, but it went from hand and leg to hand and hand. I like the no int call, but I wouldn't have been mad if it was.
Nah, they CRUSHED Mercer
Yeah, that's gonna be a no from me, dog. 
2nd to one
Am I the only one who thinks the Dr Pepper guy is annoying as fuck
Why is Kevin in the Film Room if he isn't with a&m anymore?
How many “true” national titles for Bama?
When Fromm's head got shoved after the play on 3rd down and we can't get a call? Yep. This ref crew is crap.
He is BAKED.
You're grounded all summer
Lil Sweet rubbing his dirty ass boots in to the sheets
Trick question.  They can't control their bowels.
;)
Then our TD out the back of the end zone earlier counts too.
Georgia auburn rivalry is the oldest rivalry in college football
I swear if these dudes spit that lame ass shit about NBA Primetime again
Could be worse. I have watched "what time is it, primetime" like 500 times. Horrible commercial complements of espn. 
Man Tebow sucks at driving
Why did I think Vince Dooley was dead. Huh.
Lawn not gonna mow itself.
Like lil Sebastian
Did you just...
Sadly agree :(
WatchESPN is playing the NBA Saturday Primetime ad five times during every commercial break.
They just showed a Falcons logo, oh noI'm so sorry Georgia 
Idgaf what anyone says, Diet Dr Pepper pillow commercial is hilarious.
I had Chik-Fil-A for the first time in years today and I realized that I'm an idiot for not going more often. There's one less than a mile from my house, though it's in a mall which is a bit less convenient.
As someone from here, they always ask where your from
It's called the "Deep south's oldest rivalry"
Yes vanguard etfs!!
ClearlyNotThat.docx
You need jesus 
Well fuck, the rest of the game is going to be a Ass clencher, and I'm a neutral fan here.
QBs know Bama is a run heavy system
We just have one mascot though. Maybe you're thinking of Auburn? 
So Musgrave with Katherine Webb the whole game?
True. I just figured it would be easy to prevent dehydration on the sidelines and thought it would be more serious. Definitely possible though 
Tua Tiagolaothahsvduf?
I wish I had a GT-R just because.
Yes, but the ball was moving as he was going out of bounds.  Need to have complete control of the ball.
Defense, or just two shitty offenses going at it? 
Chick-fil-A is full of shit. I've tailgated with Auburn fans and sat in the student section with black and red face paint with no problems.
Dude. Can hershcel get a few snaps in tonight ?  Dude is still fit AF. 
They rely more on running than most teams.
Yeah just lemme drop 30k on a pool so I don't have to give my daughter rides to her friends
Did someone say.. Ohio State?
Lol cute (eastern time)
Your team, like your opinion, is irrelevant. 
With the Auburn/Georgia success, Chick-Fil-A is building another table for Israelis and Palestinians right in Jerusalem
Lady is contemplating her existence haha
How is 48 still playing? 
Auburn IMO
OSU-Michigan on the other hand...
We can''t let the shit of CFP commitee screw up and make it look like Bama didn''t belong or anything 
Chick fil A is a delicacy 
Except on Sundays
Horse collar?
Oh look, it's that annoying commercial from last week with the billion dollar pool and the most obnoxious kid ever.
I hope he is too, and dont mean to downplay, but in all likelyhood he fainted due to heat, or locking his knees. Shit happens A LOT in the services. Ive personally seen it at least two dozen times
Just the language that would be flying would be unacceptable for a wholesome place like chickfila
Josh Lambo's moustache gives me the vapors
Computers in 1942???
Daboll underestimated Kirby Smart. Smart is a better defensive coordinator than most of the guys in the NFL. 
How did a computer pick UGA in 1942?
Face mask??Edit: Apparently not
What made the Kick-Six extra special awesome for me was how Saban threw a fit to get that last second put on the clock so he could try and win it before OT... only to lose the game in perhaps the most memorable and amazing way that I will ever see in my life.
We've always had great kickers
GTR is the most overrated car on the planet
Aww! Its imitating some of Tua's throws
Fuck that. I got work tomorrow.
Computers picked the 1940 national champion?? Da fuck?
You deserve the sweeet reward of no bullshit commercials
He is back in wtf
Starring Kendal Jenner
Jalen Hurts hasn't played in the third quarter and is still our leading rusher in carries.
DAMN THAT KID HAS A FAMILY
wtf is going on with georiga backs, whose the rb1?
They said *Ford Escape* and I only heard Florida State 
No way Tebow would lease that wimpy Nissan 
That much drama I expected them to be uniting Israel and Palestine
> You guys win these close games because the refs are scared of saban or some shit?we're one of the most penalized teams dude, wtf are you talking about? 
Lol why is that?
It popped up in the air for a half second, how did he have control the entire time?
Herschel walker must take nugenix.
Lil Sweet os the guy who lost the first season of American Idol to Kelly Clarkson.
I''m really starting to hate those Northwestern Mutual commercials.
1130 in eastern. Fucking sucks.
That''s exactly how i feel lol 
You watching the Losers Lounge?!?
Man, there have been some huge calls and non-calls all in Bama's favor this game.
Instead of driving, the dad installed a new pool?What kind of shitty financial decision is that? 
I hope that the Alabama football team has fewer points than the Georgia football team when this scrimmage is over
Try switching to the espn 2 stream. Seems to be much less people using it and it''s not lagging for me
Welcome to the B1G and you're playing OSU.
first time I've agreed with a Stanford fan in years
Ya. After the play. Strike to the head. You can't say he was trying to 'get up'. That was a clear penalty for unsportsmanlike conduct.
WTF 48 is back 
Nice job dude. Proud of you. 
You mean Waffle Home
Lil Sweet was a NY firefighter on 9/11
No
"Dad, can I go hang out at a friend's?"    "Fuck you, I'm gonna build a pool now"
There's 48
K Georgia, play to win, don''t play to not lose
how is he back in?
Okay but where is the flag on that
Nice horse collar. Edit: on replay never mind. 
Uh... 48 is back in?
I know.
Man seriously. Any "big" play that might be in Georgia's favor gets reviewed (and kills momentum) and bama has had a bunch of missed calls go their way.  Last weekend's games were much better and evenly officiated.
It's 4th down. Damn right it's good
LMAO THEY PUT 48 BACK IN
Baw gawd! That's 48's music!
threw him down by his neck
bitch thats what feet are for.
False start was pretty straight forward. 2 people jumped and defense moved after the ball was moving.
OH SHIT 48
told you he was going to kill somebody
Im not buying any Dr Pepper products till they pull the fucking Prince commercials of the air. To be fair, I don't drink soda but whatever. Fuck that commercial.
Lil Sweet is def fucking that dude's wife
He never had possession of the ball while in bounds. 
Because they have no history of QB success in the NFL other than.... Joe Namath?
Something strong
Oh hell no you can''t pull that
Georgia needs to quit bringing it out
IT'S 48!!!!!
hes back!!!!
You have to have friends to play that game. 
48 Strikes again!
A CLOSE LINE DID THAT JESUS
Lol fuck this guy and Fowler for sayin he was “fired up” 
Uhhh
REKT
Who would win: Generations of racism or one fried boi
Tuhluhluhluh was the top rated dual threat QB, though.
48 back in the game? Seriously?
The fact that these offenses were competent enough to win their bowls games says something, honestly. 
Why the fuck is 48 back in the game?
The fuuuuuuck
Hershel still looking like he could come in and play right now.
HOW IS 48 STILL PLAYING WTF
Get this 48 mother fucker off the field.
Fuck these refs.
That looked....Violent.
Damn really expected that to be a flag...
HOLY FUCK THAT HIT
damn that dude in stronk
Maybe 48 wont be cut
Probably has something to do with literally hating throwing the ball.
I guess they're worried about being benched halfway thru the natty
Yes
Stimulating nerve endings that never get stimulation 
Perfect
If it was called correctly, it would have been a false start on like three players, with the same result as what we had. Try again, I'll wait.
HOLY SHIT. Get him off the field
dawgs please
I'm sorry, how the fuck is that not a penalty?
No flag?
BAH GAWD JR
crazy tackle
48 still playing?
I'd say Auburn. Tech is a fun game but it's not quite as heated. And that play (last year?) escalated everything
You can't possibly be complaining about that end zone non INT? The punt block & facemask sure... That almost pick by Sanders? Nah 
Yes.  When the ball moved he lost possession and did not regain possession until out of bounds. 
Your definition of control is vastly different than the rulebooks definition of control.  You can't say he bobbled it around while also saying he maintained control.
You can try and punch a coach and still play for Bama I guess.
Holy shit, Saban let him back in the game?
Holy shit
Oh shit, 48 is back
WHERE THE FUCK IS THE FLAG!?!?!
I clicked the link expecting it to be a video of it or something, what an amazing surprise. 
Tua was a 5 star? A bunch of the guys who Hurts beat out were 4/5 stars as well
WELCOME TO MY HOUSE
yes
Bama will let anyone on the field. Dude literally punched a coach and he''s still playing 
Fuck 48.
That was violent! I'm shocked they're still letting him play
Wait, THEY LET HIM BACK INTO THE GAME?
Oh gosh Brown is back in!?!?
The fuck was that
Good thing he's still in the game.
Thats not clean
about to collapse on itself forming a blackhole.
Jalen and Tua were both pretty highly rated. I think Tua was the 1 or 2 QB
no, not even close
He just made a tackle
That fucker shouldn''t even be in the game. 
Fuck this 48 dude
What  A FUCKING CLOTHES LINE
They act like asking people to go to Chick-fil-A is a chore.
TRUUUUUUUE FRESHMAN
Stupid return
WWF
THAT WAS THE DUDE WHO PUNCHED HIS COACH
Use that aggression in a good way kid
I would not. He HATES Iowa.
Same as yours, buck
Fuck 48
48 WITH THE CLOTHESLINE!!!
I can''t believe this kid is still in the game 
BRADSHAW WITH THE CLOTHESLINE FROM HELL
HES STILL PLAYING????? Whatttt
I guess that's legal.
Damn took him out with one arm my god 
oh my
They fucking let that piece of shit play again? 
Hot damn what a tackle
Nope
Tua was a 5* and one of the top dual threat QB recruits in the nation last year.
Typical BYU behavior
How is that guy still in the game?
Wow, that guy is in, huh?
Who let this guy back in?
I just have this urge to take out a policy with Northwest Mutual,  for some reason. 
What the fuck?
Alvin Kamara for a brief moment in time. Ok ok. Doesn't count. 
Was it truefreshman
I think it was the offsides on the blocked punt actually. 50yd difference in field position in a 10-0 game that would have made it at least 13-0
How did Saban let him back on the field 
Lol.  Have a good night man.  Hope your team wins
I cannot believe they let that guy back in the game. Wow
48 is in the game????
Jersey
WTF 
Hmmm. Is that clean?
Yes we will
He juggled the ball trying to move it to his hands while going out of bounds. If he would have just held it against his thigh, it probably would have been an INT.
Longest running rivalry in the sec. Been playing since 1892. 
I calculated it. 
i dont have a team xD. i need to find one.
48s back in? Bama that's nasty
> 48Why is he still playing?
48 still in
WHY THE HELL IS 48 BACK ON THE FIELD
How the fuck is 48 still playing.*He swung his helmet at a fucking coach for crying out loud.
48 is dirty
They put that dick back in?
ITS 48!
THEY LET HIM BACK ON THE FIELD 
48 just murdered that guy
Is that legal? I think it was but it looked like it shouldn''t be. 
48 emerges from the pit of misery!
Oooooookaaaaayyy. Yikes.
Ball was moving around on his body/not fully secured in his hands until he was very clearly out of bounds.  If it was actually pinned securely against his body and not moving I would call it a catch, but that's not at all what happened.
Thats dirty
Holy shit he's back on the field?
Get this man out of the game before he hurts someone.
That fuckface should not be in the game. 
Where the fuck is the call
Just stand on the other side of the restaurant.
AU
WHY IS HE STILL IN THE FUCKING GAME
manhandled...
Oh look the guy that should've been ejected.
Wait. He''s still in the game?
I can believe 48 is still playing
https://i.imgur.com/3QSjRS9.png
Sounds like you've never been to Bama.. 
Nope
Can confirm, will collapse with low blood sugar. Takes me a minute to get up sometimes.  
Why is 48 still in the game
Why is that guy in the game
Yo this kid needs to be kicked off the team 
Nick Saban going to put Lil Sweet in for the 4th 
Oh the guy that shouldn't be in the game made that play?  Neat.
That tackle was hard but clean, but he shouldn't be in the game at all
HE'S ANGRY 
i hate that diet dr pepper ad
holy hell what a clothesline
I''m already over yesterday to agree with you on that one. Also, as much as that hurt, I have a lot of respect for how awesome your arena seemed for that game. The pain is why I love college everything over pro anything. Tomorrow I''m back to hating you again though. 
why is that guy even allowed on the field? HE PUNCHED A COACH
For the life of me I can't figure out why, but I love those lil sweet commercials. The actor just sells it so well. 
How is that motherfucker still in this game?
runs over and knocks out Saban 
Clothesline''s are legal?
Wtf horse collar
I'll take what is a horse collar for 500 alex.
Of course, it's still cool though.
lol 48 is back again, Saban has no morals
Why the hell is 48 back on the field
he fucking closelined him
Why the fuck is he even still out there?! 
“Comes back with bad intentions” *makes a clean arm tackle*But why is he even playing...
HE COMES AGAIN
LMFAO GUESS WHO
OH SHIT HE'S BACK AND MAD
Damn that dude is so freakin strong 
#48 is a baaaaad mannnnn
Bama has always relied on the running game and offensive line way more. There have been some standouts, but most QBs end up just being game managers. 
These refs aren't calling shit on Bama and it's fucking ridiculous
How the hell is 48 back in the game
How do you put that dumb motherfucker back in the game? Nothing is too low for Saban apparently.
The person who made that tackle should not be in the game. He threw a punch and tried to go after a coach on the sideline.But we're just gonna ignore that I guess?
48 back to punching
Run heavy team identity for a long while
they seem to find the biggest rednecks they can
Mekhi Brown shouldn't even be on the field...
They let him back in and he promptly clotheslines someone.
uh can you do that
IT'S FUCKING 48 AGAIN
48: You shall not pass! 
He sent that boy to the shadow realm.
How was that not a personal foul? My God
Greatest redemption story ever 
refs...
At this point I'd actually be surprised if Georgia manages to hang on. Fucking Alabama
Refs won't call that? What the fuck..
REDEMPTION FOR 48
And he got back on the field
How dare you
All that special sauce belongs to me!
Grabbed his shoulder not a horsecollar
Eek, he clotheslined him
Lmao got his ass
LARIATO!
horse collar????
How was that not called? Wtf?
Y'all eat that trash Wendy and White Trashle anyway
Fuckin closelined
I'm honestly unaware, is that tackle legal?
Why is 48 back in? Disgusting.
Why the fuck is he even playing?
Yikes
Was a clean tackle but still fuck 48
No way that's the same guy wow
Clothesline
i starting reading your comment and it struck a cord in my heart. i truly had a pleasure reading this. FUCK ESPN. eventually, if enough people say it they''ll change 
Pretty sure chicken means rat in Michiganese anywayIt's for the best
How is 48 back in there?
I'm amazed saban let him back in. 
He hit a coach and they let him back in the game smh losing respect for Saban 
That looked painful.
Saban is gutless for putting 48 back in. Pathetic 
Can't believe that dude is still in
BAH GAWD WHAT A CLOTHESLINE!!!
Hands to the face
How the fuck is he still playing
Leave your mom's basement buddy. Someone will say hi.
Im thinking, why you gonna build a pool for that ungrateful shit of a daughter?
HOW IS 48 STILL ON THE FIELD AFTER ATTACKING A COACH. FUCK ALABAMA.
He just one arm slam tacked his ass from a sprint lol. 
I guess Bama really did bribe the refs with more than they bought the Playoff committee. 
That was 100% a viscous hit. How the fuck did that dude get back in the game.
How the fuck did that dude get back on the field
Nick Saban is a disciplinarian!
LMAO THEY PUT THAT DUDE BACK IN THE GAME. Georgia dude must''ve said some awful shit to him.
Man Tim tebow seems like such a genuine nice guy. Can't believe he used to get so much hate
If CFA made an Army/Navy rivalry restaurant, it would just be mids and cadets stealing each others' hats
geeze, grabs him by the jugular
I always imagine the actual response as: "Bring your big ears back here! Don't talk to me like that. This is my house! Don't like it? Fly away."
How great it is to see him next to an old white guy though, eh?
Nice 
48 is back in!
Ahh 48 is still playing after trying to punch a coach!
WHY THE FUCK is he still playing, get his trashy ass out of here, I don''t care if he forced a fumble and scored there, fucking classless
Oh fuck you Alabama, all the talk of tradition and you put 48 in 
That dude is enormous
Clean hit but that guy should not be on the field 
Bama dity? Who would have thought
pulled him down via armpit jesus
how the fuck is that not a penalty
I swear to god Bama''s gonna get an interception on this drive
Last game of the year Brent, can't hold anything back
They fucked up the punt block too.
Not true. You could be like Hank Hill and love your lawn, but then you would 100% have a riding mower. I mean if you have the space to build a pool, you would definitely use a riding mower. 
I can't believe they put 48 back in lol
Idk who 48 is but I hate him
Why is 48 back in the game? Dude seems like a POS
How many penalties did Alabama get called for?
Dooley and Walker. Love is real.
Hershel Walker would have 180 yards in this game
I know that tackle felt so good for Brown
They have two on the roster right now and had a couple transfer last year. Their style doesn't really lend itself to awesome QB play though and they're playing with underclassmen at the position for the first time quite awhile.
MY FAVOURITE COLOUR IS RED MY NEIGHBOUR 
48 being in this game should tell you all you need to know about Saban. 
Why is he back in the fucking game?
So that's why he's still there
The Homer''s Telecast is getting weird
Oh, the guy that should have been thrown out of the game makes a big play for Bama. Shocker.
Bama letting 48 play?  Dirty...
I'm definitely want to play with#48
Horse collar? That kid is absolutely reckless. Surprised we even let him back out there.
Is that Derick Henry?
I do not like the Dr. pepper commercials.
For the reason you just seen lol
Pshhh, who needs discipline when there's a football came to win?
That you did. Yes. That you did. 
THEY LET 48 BACK IN THE GAME ARE YOU SERIOUS
48 is such a piece of shit 
He's still playing?Saban is clearly soft.
THE MOST HATED MAN... IN THE WORLD
I guess if you're good enough you can take a setting at your coach and get back in the game.
Of course, M. Brown still on the field after assaulting a coach. #FuckBama
Why is that piece of shit playing 
nasty as fuck
God that kid is so annoying 
I honestly don't mind them getting it right. Its just every catch I reviewed and it's a huge thing every week.
Wow, Alabama is trying it's best to be hated by the rest of the country.
Scholarship reinstated.
Well well look who it is
You can attack a coach and Saban wont even bench you?
Ok cool, clotheslines are legal
How is 48 still in the game?
lmfao, Saban really gives a shit about discipline when he's down in the Natty.
I am rooting for UCF
We clothes lining people now.
What the fuck
no character...smh
Yea I agree with you on this one.  He shouldn't be playing.
Wasn't Tua highly recruited? 
The strength that probably took... damn
Horse collar ?
STAY AWAY FROM 48 DERRICK HENRY 
48 doesn't care what team you're on! He is going to take you down!
48 might be a murderer
I want that guy gone. He''s gonna kill someone. 
My espn stream keeps freezing.. blah
Obviously you can. No flag 
he needs to make it out and then back in for safety, it'd be a touchback
Saban put 48 back in? Wow
thats the kid who punched a coach right? lmao fuck alabama
THAT GUY WAS BACK IN THE GAME?!?!?! WHAT THE FUCK!!!!!!
How the fuck is 48 not off the team
Dude attacks a coach and they let him stay in? lol that's pathetic E- coach 
No way 48 should be on the team let alone playing 
Called it.. 48 is back on the field cause Saban don''t care as long as you''re good 
How the hell is he on the field 
How in the fuck does bama always get away with shit
Surprised he's back in honestly.
It's okay when Bama clotheslines  because it's Bama.Also cool to shove the QBs face to the ground cause Bama. 
Herschel is still swole as fuck
Return of the Sith
48, bitches
Damn these one arm close lines
Nah, he just went out of his way to talk shit. I'd call him a dumb shit if he weren't an MD.
His two main friends and WRs Jeudy (beast) and Ruggs are both Freshmen. 
GTFO with 48 still playing. 
Duck that guy 
48 is back. He''s like the Hulk you just wanna get him on your side.
I didnt think you were allowed to do that...
That looked vicious, but was clean.  How fucking tall is Bama, or how short is UGA?
That was a legal hit why are yall complaining lmao 
Say ya to da U.P. eh?
That''s not what that is 
Alabama showing low integrity allowing 48 to play
Look who didn't get benched for punching a player and shoving a coach. We back to early 2000s levels of Bama discipline.
HOLY FUCK THAT ARM TACKLEHow is this guy still playing? He punched a Georgia player and swung at a coach.
Holy shit! He's back in! LMAO
That's the dirtiest clean I've ever seen. Good tackle. 
Of course Bama lets that dude back in
LMAO 48 
Who would win? Georgia or one little punchy murder boii
Ironic since he should have been ejected.
Thought clotheslining people was illegal? No? Ok then..
I''m actually shocked we put Mekhi back in 
BAH GAWD BROWN WITH THE CLOTHESLINE FROM HELL
Horse collar.
What the hell is he doing back in the game?
Just a reminder that Bama under Saban has won every single championship except the 2009 one as the lower ranked team 
Yeah seriously. I'll bet we know soon. 
??? The dude was clearly fumbling the ball the entire time, never had a good handle on it. Yeah he had a foot down but that doesn't matter when you don't have control of the football.
He had control against his leg. Even shit NFL refs could make that call, BIG10 refs I guess not
That''s one strong armed man
Why is that guy on the field and not in jail?
Throws a punch that lands, and comes back in? Fuck Saban.
Sabin does not kick kids off teams
Alabama is playing Pappanasty
Was that really legal? Holy shit 
Thanks big 10 refs...
Couldn''t agree more. 
Not a facemask or anything
Literally a point where he is out of bounds, in the air, and neither of his hands are actually touching the ball.
Why the hell would Saban let him back in the game???
Did they just say "the computers" voted UGA national champions in 1942? Uhh..
Oh that was 48.Good to see that Saban cares about disciplining his players.
That Bama kid is on a warpath
SABAN DIDNT KICK HIM OUT WTF
They rely on running so much its not a great place for nfl development or qbs who wanna put up mad numbers
Preferably a donut shaped cushion
Nope. Touchback.It has to get back into the field of play, then georgia would have to put it back into the end zone, then dead ball for it to be a safety..
I'm outright shocked that they let 48 back in the game after fighting a coach
Saban let that dumbass back in the game???
I want to spend time with my daughter. Let me go build her a $40,000 pool so she doesn''t want to go out 
YOU CAN PUNCH A PLAYER, GO AFTER THE COACH, AND STILL BE PUT BACK IN THE GAME??? WTF BAMA. 
48 is still in the game???? Shows you what Bama cares about attitude 
Fucker should've been ejected. 
I like where this is goingEdit:never mind
So this is a pretty big drive 
To destroy that kick returner.
Because Bama
Yeah, but you have to catch the ball in bounds too
no because you have to get in play on the field and not in the endzone first
that fact that 48 is playing is a diagrace
Wait, they put that fucker back in? He should have been ejected!
No way, is he coming back out there?
I agree.https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DLGPkCEX0AAkV9Z.jpg
Can someone honestly tell me how they put 48 back in? Makes me sick man
this motherfucker
JESUS CHRIST WHAT BEASTS HAS SABAN SUMMONED UP FROM THE DEPTHS FROM WHICH HE CAME???
Update, now I need a gif of that clothesline
They just did, and damn was it entertaining 
How the heck is he still in this game...
My question too! I thought he would be in the locker room by now. However, that tackle answers the question 
I hate that commercial
I love this version of the broadcast, but that Duke coach needs to shut up
Im angry that our offense was too trash to expose your terrible team yes
pfft clothesline +  horse-collar tackle  perfectly legal for bama
WHAT A COMEBACK BY #48
you never played football shut up
Didn''t grab the face mask 
I want Bama to lose solely because I don't like #48 lol 
I was sure 48 was gonna get kicked off the team after that tantrum. Saban getting soft.
Saban showing his true colors 
Clean ish hit. Dude has to cool those emotions some. 
Everyone saying it''s dirty but that was a huge momentum play
Bah gawd, king. He clothes lined bim 
Got damn
Flair up 
If you're Bama
Their style of play isn't really conducive to getting guys drafted high.  Top QB prospects want to play in a system that lets them throw a lot and develop in a pro style offense.
For what
Then why didn''t they call the false start?
The fact that #48 is still even on the sidelines is ridiculous.
Ah yes, the guy that should have been ejected by the refs and then by his coaches. Glad to see he's still playing.
Fuck you refs
48 for Bama shouldn't be in the game.
Shit that daughter got some sass. "UGHHHHHH" SHIT, bitch you gave your dad .5 seconds to respond to a question while he was using a loud ass lawn mower.
Who said this game wasn't entertaining?? How many fools missed out and are missing out because it's two SEC teams. 
Ball bounced out of his hands and was juggled after his foot went down in the end zone. Have to have full control and a foot in for it to be a completion
That goes without saying. People fucking hate Alabama.
Why the hell did they let that dumbass back on the field? He took a swing at a coach. Way to stand for something, Bama. 
clean man tackle there
He wanted to grab the face mask there 
Alabama fans are slowly perking up. Not moving too fast as to not jinx anything.
Damn, that hit reminded me of Night Train Lane!
It really is an embarrassment for Bama to do that.
lol 48 is in
Nick Saban is a fucking coward 
Looked dirty but a clean hit
NCAA 2005 Update: Arkansas was forced to use a WR as their punter in this game due to off-field issue and this time it worked out as my Gators muffed it right next to the coverage team so Arkansas has a new set of downs at their own 36 yard line with 1:09 to go in the 1st
we need to go after browns knees and end his career
That oversimplifies that situation. The ball was bobbled in after he left the ground and landed out of bounds when he had established possession. Definitely incomplete.
48 don't give a fuck. 
48 still being in the game is an embarrassment. 
Damn what a clothesline
I guess trying to kill your coach on the sideline subsequently makes you an insane tackler
yea...please stop doing that.
Hey Dawgs, y'all got any more of 'dem points? Plz
What the fuck
At this point, it's about supporting the AAC and the G5. Also, if UCF can declare themselves national champs, then we can declare Quinton Flowers the Heisman winner. 
Lmao is that #48
Really can't believe that shit head (48) is back on the field
Wtf 48 back in!????? Wtf bama
God damn it, Bama are going to win this shit, aren't they?
If I hear these guys rap again I might blow out my brain
Chicago suburbs. Pool weather is June. Math checks out. 
I hate you guys, but I hate people who cry about the refs more.  Sometimes people have legitimate complaints, but people on these subs cry over every fucking thing.
Georgia if you Andy Reid this game so fucking help me....
WHAT THE FUCK BAMA, you''re literally the villains of CFB. Dude actually punched a coach.
"Wild dawg"...I'm glad it went for negative yards
That''s a clothesline not a horse collar. Think about what you say
YOU TAKE THAT BACK
48 told the coaches he'd kill them if he didn't get put back in, huh?
Embarrassing that Saban let that guy back into the game. 
Alabama would get away with murder in this game
That's a legal tackle???
THE CURSE OF THE FALCONS LOOMS
nice playcalling
If you play for bama everything is legal.
Lol my friends call me crazy but i love them too
A clean arm tackle?
DILLY DILLY
Live in Georgia.  So no.  I'm not fucking new
48 visualizing Saban with that clothesline ala Bobby BoucherEdit: if you''re not first you''re last
Wait so the point of this commercial is that he's trying to ~~murder~~ vehicular manslaughter all of the other teams' mascots but his car won't let him?
So the guy who punched a player and swung at a coach is back in the game. Tell me more about how Nick Saban values discipline on his team. 
CHubb taking the snapOnly an idiot thinks a pass is going to happen
Seriously Saban you kept your player in who punched another player in the face? Spineless
Wilddawg lul
ok, time to cancel the wild dog
I thought he literally tried to punch a coach but did not land a punch? Also, kid has passion, probably best option at that position. There's no trophy for a moral victory.
What would you call?
bama
He''s back in the game
He fuckin clotheslined him
How the fuck is that not a flag!
"Fired Up". That's one way of putting it.
moral standards
Such a stupid play. Not like he's gonna throw.
Did dis dude just say Wild Dawg?
My stream keeps playing this NBA Primetime rap commercial over and over and I want to die
Unless bama pulls their pants down and shits through Georgia's facemask its considered clean
I agree but that was clean
Yes it did, he had it pinned against his leg then let go and readjusted and he was clearly out. Easy no catch
I have no clue this has been great I hope other games have this option as well
Classless to put 48 back in. Realllll high standards in the great state of Bama
So fucking sad that Saban let 48 play
How is that guy still playing.
Did they seriously let the dude who took a swing at a coach back in the game
direct snaps are fucking stupid
Don''t fuck this up Georgia
The one playing was the top rated dual threat QB in the country. Define "never seems to get".
Is the joke that he's trying to commit vehicular manslaughter and the car won't let him? 
Wow I didnt think Saban would put up with 48s actions. Guess hes cool with it. 
I bet the daughters friend only has a pop up pool and he felt the need to shame them by building his pool.
Christ, nice tackle or not that guy is going to kill or maim someone
Holy shit, I can't believe Saban let that guy back in the game. Does he know he swung at a coach?
They paid people without actual affiliations  money to sit at a table. There's only like .4 seconds of footage at the gate that isn't drone shot.
Touchback. Have to leave the endzone into field of play and back into endzone for safety to occur. 
Except if it was called correctly, the false start on three different players would have been called, leading to the exact same result as what we had.
Alabama gonna win in the most soul crushing possible way cuz there is no god
Seriously, Michel needs to run the wild dawg over Chubb
That dude shouldn't even be in this game. Punch on the field, swing a helmet at a coach? Gtfo
Run run pass?
Extremely simplified answer: run heavy offense, QB avoids mistakes rather than make plays
Only from behind.
I guess you can attack your coach at Bama and keep playing in the game.
Georgia scared
Retribution for 48
wait..... they let him back on the field? THE FUCK???
Lol, can attack a coach and still play
How the everloving *fuck* is 48 still in this game??
I''ve said it like 5 times nowWHY DOES GEORGIA KEEP RUNNING OUTSIDE 
Wow y''all have no idea what a horse collar tackle is
What a stupid play call. The whole country knows what's coming 
Let's stop with the wild Dawg
Yep, no facemask or horse collar
because they can't have a restaurant across state lines that way
They put that guy back in the game? lmao
Who would win:Little Sweet vs. Larry Culpepper
Predictable as fuck 
That was a clean tackle, despite it looking not so. 
Lol has Chubb gotten to the line of scrimmage today? 
[deleted]
Holy shit, that "Where the fuck you think you going" tackle.
Don't get cute with your play calls. Trust me. It won't work.
Desperate measures i guess
As predicted. 
No face mask or horse collar, still looks brutal
He was in control of what happened to the ball. Hence why he pinned it against his leg and readjusted with two hands. Was there any doubt that he would drop the ball?
They let him back on the field lmfao
LMAOOO he's back
Good to know you can get back in the game afer trying to attack your coach at Bama
Brown do good this time. Brown do good.
Kick 48
I feel like it is but that was so viscous I feel like it isn't. 
Just made a big tackle and he's immediately back in good graces.
Is the back too much better?  Probably the reason they're going to lose.  Jalen led them to two national championship games, if this were me I wouldn't be back next year
Took a swing at a coach and actually got back on the field?! What kinda disciplinary message does that send?
How the fuck is 48 back after hitting a coach lol
48 still in the game... with the clothesline
Why?
No flag on that...Alabama is able to do whatever the fuck they want
probably gonna need to score here dawgz
Dang he came back strong....:
Yeah i dont understand these things people are calling "touchdowns"Watching my teams all year, i dont think we scored any of those
Well fuck Saban for letting that dude get back on the field. 
Chubb can''t get anything today?
No Chubb. Michel.
tru frosh
That was the worst part.
Once Saban sees this he''s gonna be pissed.
How is #48 still playing 
The wildcat only works if there''s a threat of a fucking pass
Fuck Saban. 
"And the tide flowed to the right"    Okay, we know you can pun
shit call
It would be sweet if the amount of football aired was even remotely close to the amount of commercials aired
That right there is the best way to come back after that tantrum he threw on the sidelines. He just needs to get his shit together
You mean a nice crisp refreshing Dr. Pepper? 
That may be the dirtiest looking clean tackle I've ever seen
I would've kicked 48 off the team, personally.
48 is an ASSHAT
Next time a player loses it with a coach he's going to point to that moment. 
How the fuck is 48 still in the game?Punches UGA players. Punches his coaches. Swings at players trying to pull him away.The fact that Saban still has him playing makes me have absolutely zero respect for him as a coach. 
When I think of #48 I think of Jimmie Johnson
Only saban would put him back in after that shit on the sideline
Chubb has been shut down tonight. Georgia needs to keep feeding Sony.
Is Sony hurt? 
That boy ain't right 
Dilly dilly
Literally same lmao 
Hey, what kind of Freshmen are playing in this game?
Yea, it shouldn''t be but it is 
really baffling.  i guess women like them?
Flair up
The wildcat is so fucking dumb. Especially against bama 
Chubb is not having a good night
[I got you buddy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kkq8a6AV3HM)
I''m from the east coast too, i thought in-n-out was good but waaaaaaay overhypedNo i''m not an asshole contrarian lol
48 still talking out of the side of his mouth
I don't understand why pappanastos is so bad at kicking in college. He was a monster in highschool and it was pretty annoying watching him kick a 50+ yarder all the time when I played him.
Holy moly 48
Wilddawg got stuffed
He grabbed jersey.  It was clean
Cuz he is Spike from Little Giants
I know. 
But did you *dine together*
didn't you see, Herschel Walker
Remember Georgia, if you blow this the rest of America will hate you
dudes on roids
It's incredible how much better Bama's defense plays when the offense can stay on the field for more than 30 seconds
Win at all costs, I guess.
Yes? What rule says they aren''t honestly...
Thanks, you too! 
Why is #48 even a part of the game at this point?
The Wild dog comment alone cost them yards
Going Wildcat on first down? Why?
True freshman guys keep that in mind
GG Alabama no respect
Not a horse collar tackle
Saban cares more about winning than disciplining his players confirmed
> Wild-dogYou're not funny announcers...Edit: I stand corrected.
48 is back in? Has saban no shame?
Clean hit??
I honestly don''t know why but that tackle reminded me of The Scorpion King.
Alabama: Championships > Rest of the country
48 is going to fuck us over here, could've broke that kids fucking neck
I don't think it's fair to compare the QBs, since Tua hasn't even played half a game yet
everyone: 48 is never gonna play again48: hold my gatorade
That guy swung on a coach and is back in the game? wow.
When does wildcat ever work?
I predict 5 OTs
UGA very well may win this game.but i'm so glad to see signs of life from this alabama team.
Don''t forget face masks. Those are fine too. 
I tried to watch this game as a neutral observer but the botched punt and facemask alone whiplashed me in favor of Georgia. Fuck these refs 
How the fuck is Mekhi Brown still in this game? 
How in the world is that guy back in the game? 
Saban only cares about winning, nothing else
48 went back in after punching a coach?!
Bama really embracing that whole evil empire thing at this point
Chubb in the wildcat.  Wonder what they'll do.
Please god go with Sony over Chubb right now
I swear to god y''all don''t know the rules of football.
Refs are ridiculously bad. Blatant holds, face masks, unsportsmanlike conduct, horse collar. But hey as long as Bama wins!
asking the important questions!spicy chicken sandwich, nuggets, and a milkshake. buffalo and polynesian sauces
what is going to take for the Georgia coaches to accept Chubb is off his game tonight
48 is still in the game... 
this dude is fucking crazy 
I don't understand. So is this like the 3rd place match since UCF already won the championship?
Because win.
Dude is a fucking sociopath. Literally. And the refs won't call 48 on his shit
How the shit is #48 still in the game? I get that we have injuries and all that, but fuck that guy
lmao a clothesline
Pretty clear that Saban cares only about winninf.
Thanks man
I guess if you can hit your coach with your helmet then you can get away with a clothesline.
That dude is straight up dirty and disrespectful. 
Lil Sweet is like a white prince? 
Why is this fucker still playing?
Lmao why is that dude still even on the team
You''re telling me the kid swung on a coach and was put BACK IN THE GAME?And they said that hit was clean?! I''m over this game
>attacks coach  >gets to play still   Just bama things
> We've been saying true freshman a lot tonightYeah I fuckin noticed
Kirk breaking the meme fourth wall right now smdh
That was the exact play they won the rose bowl on. Take notes on how to defend it Mike
Meh, if you run into the Walmart Wolverines they can get super, super fiesty. When that happens, the best response is to simply state "Honestly, I'm just glad you got to attend such a prestigious university and complete your education"
Saban must be really desperate to keep no. 48 in.  If this were any other game he probably wouldn''t come back in.
"We've been saying true freshman a lot tonight"Holy shit they are becoming self aware
That Bama culture though. I'm sure if I'd  took a swing at one of my coaches I'd of been put back in the game.
He forgot to punch a coach this time 
Kinda disappointed they don't call that formation the Dingo. 
BAH GAWD THAT'S 48'S MUSIC
tru freshamnnnnnnnnnnn
The **abacuses voted UGA national champions. He just misspoke
Same with any sports sub and a team that consistently is really good
Holy Fuck. That kid is still on the team. 
I think there''s one thing we all can agree on here... fuck watchESPN. 
Fucker's got long ass arms. 
I can''t believe #48 is back in the game 
Seriously. He is back in the game? Tells you everything you need to know about the Alabama team. 
True Freshamn. Herbie is hard a rock 
facts.
Hey guys did you know these guys are true freshman?
Player 48 has entered the game
Use your emotion during the play. 
It's always been win at all costs for Saban, not surprising.
username checks out
They let him back on the field after fighting everyone?
Heees Baaaack!
 Gimme Michel
I can't imagine Chubb has positive yardage?
I will forever hate direct snap to the running back. The entire stadium knows what he''s gonna do
That was clean af but damn it was vicious 
.... Whatever it takes to win, right Saban? Dude swung on a player, then grabbed at the throat of a staffer. No accountability.
At least 48 got demoted to special teams. That'll teach him. edit. Am idiot. He was always there. Thanks guys. 
Pretty sure there is a warrant out for 48s arrest.
Its incredible how the computers voted for Georgia in 1942. 
It's not that the refs care about 'bama, it's that they care about this game become interesting. Fuck this shit. Glad I'm illegally streaming.
He's already back in
Dude attacked a coach and stayed in the game?? WTF BAMA?
That tackle was NASTY. 
Quick question, is 48 on returns? If so kick him the ball and go low on him
true. fresh. man.
Why is Chubb still getting carries?
I mean... I think you just saw why. 
Probably because of the catchy Flo Rida playing in your head right now 
Annnnnnd he just made the tackle.
Classy move putting 48 back in Coach Saban
48 throws a punch and is not thrown out of the game... Tries to fight a coach and gets to play again.. Lol
Saban has completely immersed himself in the dark side now
TRUE FRESHMAN — DRINK
Letting the thugass back on the field. No consequences
Bro put Michel in
FUCK BROWN. Was that not a horse collar?
Then clotheslines the returner
Wait did 48 actually punch someone in this game?
Y'all see who made the gucking tackle? 
Question, if bama wins.  Who is national champ?  UCF or Refs?
Dude got clotheslined. 
The right looked pretty open to me...
Awesome fuckin clothesline lmao
Just Saban things.
No, that's Alabama
"I think I broke his fucking neck"
Wow, I cannot believe he is still in the stadium, let alone on the field.
Holy shit 48 gonna kill everybody
48 needs to find a new sport. Football is not physical enough for him.
Nice discipline, Saban 
How is #48 still in the game?
Alan turning, my dude
Nice block
Bobby bouchet? 
I was really hoping he'd booted him.
Horse collar? Lol everyone is forgetting rules in their alabama hate
#OH MY GOD THAT WAS #48
T R U E F R E S H M A N
Herb just went meta.
good play call
It was the same dirty asshat from before. Step the fuck down.
#TRUEFRESHMANBTW
I never want to see the wild dawg again.
Fuck that guy, but damn that was an impressive tackle. 
Rules question: was that a legal tackle by #48? seems so dirty..
SAVE ME TOM CRUISE
Satan
HOW''S IS THAT GUY STILL PLAYING FOR BAMA AFTER SWINGING AT A COACH?
It just means more
Thas Justin Guarini man
Do you know what a horse collar is?
Punched a Georgia player and tried to fight a coach and he wasn't thrown out? Nice job Refs
Nice fucking block on the side
Saban
[deleted]
Wow!!! Is this 1970s NFL where clotheslines are legal?
I just hear ESPN getting ready to circle jerk the Heisman hopes of this guys next year.
The sheer number of true freshman in this game makes me think we're set up for some dynasties here.
psssh more like tame dawg ammirite
Blue eyes. One blew West and one blew East.
drink
It looks like a whale on the side of his face 
What a fucking block man.Mecole has wheeeeeeeeeeeels
I've lost the respect I had for Saban. This is disgraceful.
Alabama is gonna win this fucking game. College football is dead. Fuck everything.
Saban is a real disciplinarian guys. XD
The fuck is 48 doing back on the field????
Nice to see that Saban is still playing 48 after his temper tantrum. Pitiful. 
Lost all respect for Saban. 
Lol
Nice call
That wasn''t a penalty 
S H U L A
How the FUCK is that dude still in the game? He swung on his own coach
48 is apparently Captain Insano
Dude attacks a coach and Bama puts him back in the game lol
Well....that was certainly a play.
"Well the Alabama Thunderers are a touchdown and a two point conversion away from winning this, and whoever scores the most wins." - The honorable and esteemed John Madden, whom we all love very much. 
I love the end around call. Use Alabama's aggression against them.
Horse Collar would be if he was behind him and grabbed the back collar of the runner.
disgraceful, honestly
Ya know I came into this game as a netural, but now fuck Alabama.  How are you gonna let that guy back in the game?
Are you telling me he's a... t r u e   f r e s h m a n ?
Hit was clean, just looked dirty
huge block
Come on.  You see how Saban deals with discipline issues.  If you're good, you get a stern talking too, then play time.
[deleted]
this conservative play calling is going to be UGA's downfall
How the fuck do you miss that?
Chubb isn't getting a break tonight 
Well, he never got to the coach. But yeah, how he's back in is beyond me
This makes me yell at the TV every time. You know what a computer is you little shit
So nice they made the coaches room more watchable.  Still to much wasted screen. I don't need to see their faces. Just give me full screen all 22 dammit. 
And he''s back in the game!
That coach dodged a bullet
He was always on special teams?
Kirk and the words "true freshman" name a more iconic duo
Just lost all respect for bama. 
How the hell is that dude still playing?!
Bama has no integrity letting a player back into the game who swung on his own coach.
Stop trying to make Chubb runs happen
National Title? Or Blitz the League?
It's a big game. /s
How in the hell is this guy back on the field
Can we survive an overtime?
Wasn't that where he was last time?
Tua and Hurts were both 5 stars, so it's not like their recruiting poorly they just haven't worked out
Saban loves to act like he has authoritarian control over his team yet he leaves #48 on the field
That''s what stars do. Why else would mascots not be allowed to talk?
Do you know what a horse collar is? 
Georgia wins in 3 OT UGA goaline stand on 4th down
So sonny michel has been running fantastic...direct snap to chubb. k
What did 48 do besides going after his coach?
Bama will complete the comeback. Calling it even with a bad Bama offense.
Truly?
...you must be new hereThat happened like 5 years ago
Because he can tackle like that.
Totally intended
48 back in the game is everything I hate about Saban's Bama
Why the fuck is Brown back in the game? Eject that fucker.
Drink x3 for that true freshman breakdown. 
UH OH KIRBY IS ONTO US!!
...wasn't that where he already was?
Culpepper would stomp
that's literally what the formation is called
Shocked they sent 48 out again 
Evidently you can throw a punch at your coach and still get the ok to be on the field. 
MEHKI BROWN IS BACK IN THE GAME?! Saban, i have lost all respect for you. You have no respect for your staff and players if you're going to allow a person like that to remain on your team.
My boss sure is going to be pissed if this goes into OT 
I think that play shows why.
that's the position he was playing when he punched the guy lol
It looked too violent to be clean, but it was 
What I saw was the player upright out of bounds, then horizontal four yards away. This is a trend.
DRINK. DRINK. DRINK. DRINK. DRINK. DRINK. DRINK. DRINK.I THINK THAT OUTTA COVER ALL THE TRUE FRESHMAN REMARKS
That wasn''t a penalty in The Longest Yard either.
nice play call
Desperation?
Why would it be a flag? He just grabbed his chest
No he didn't. Notice only Georgia fans thinks that a catch. He had possession for a second, bobbled it and didn't get full posssesion until he was out of bounds. Not a catch at all 
lol, what the fuck was that
That's clean though
I failed you Batman 
UCF, Wisconsin, pre-choke Oklahoma
Brown punches a coach and gets put back in???
They just said true freshman 4 times! Tonight we get drunk!
please offense 
Saban looks scurred 
https://youtu.be/duKpNkIOQaE
If it''s a fight to the death? Society. 
Just got a really good tackle on the kickoff return.
You know it
How the hell is 48 back in the game after assaulting his coach?!?
Need to stay inbounds to run the clock down
MMA?
*Bobby Boucher
“We''ve been saying ‘true freshman'' a lot tonight”*Says it 5 more times*
That's actually what Georgia calls it.
Ice cold Dr Pepper hair!
Let's just abandon everything that got Georgia the lead against Bama. Good strategy 
How do you beat Bama? I'm going to go out on a limb and say score more points than them
Alabama is gonna win this aren't they
Of course the horse collar wasn't called, Bama is getting away with everything with no calls, and they employ pieces of shit and let them back in the game.
May as well  have taken a knee. Bad playcall
If nothibg else, 48 will make a great person for the WWE.
That''s where he threw the punch earlier. 
How was it not clean? 
Ah. Gotcha.
Game's on in the background didn't see what happened, what's the outrage with 48?
Where is Sony?
Uh oh, Chubbs out there.
need sources 
Fired up? Dude's punching people earlier then clotheslines a guy. How is he back in the game?
[UCF Ball](#b/ucf) *Calmly waits offscreen for the reveal that he''s playing the winner*
If anybody thought Alabama was going to keep a talented player out of the game an overreaction on the sideline they are crazy
Must.stay.awake.
My thoughts exactly. But dang if that wasn't the definition of being man handled I have no clue what it is. Wow. 
He had the punch/push called for 15 and what did I miss?  Was he the one who pushed Fromm's head down while standing up?
I do too
The truest of freshmen
thats what Georgia calls the formation
Fuckin' A bud ya called it
Those saying #48 should be kicked off the team have never been on a football team or in a heated game with grace importance
MMA is licking their chops.
yeah that's fucking embarrassing 
Stay thuggsty mis amigos. 
Because he does that
that's not a penalty lol
Fact hes not benched. Ur garbage alabama 
Wish somebody had mentioned that earlier...
They busted out the abacus for the calculation
It was clean. It just looked dirty 
Alabama has sunk to a new low allowing him back in the game 
I literally expected him to be in street clothes after he *attacked a fucking coach.* What the fuck is he doing still playing?
Chubb isn't exactly doing it. Michel needs to be fed. E: or not
WWE Money in the bank
That's where he took the personal foul
Starting to?
Jeez did they not rotate touches like the 3 do now?
They put 48 back out there after literally punching a coach. Bama is simply irredeemable. 
oh look it's Mr. Punchy McPunchface
Might I suggest ECW
And Hulu too
False
God I'm so close.  If they mention true freshman one more time I'm gonna cum
Was this ever in doubt ? 
And legs. 
"bad intentions"
Brown is still playing after getting a UNS *and* going after a coach?Wow.
Stop giving it to chubb.
y'all really suprised Saban is keeping his best players in for the national championship?
I was thinking the same till I saw a man vs a boy
And then proceeds to dangerously clothesline a player on a kickoff return... 
It was clean...wasn''t a face mask or horse collar.
He didn't actually gain control of the ball until he was very clearly out of bounds.  He was in the *process* of gaining control, but it wasn't pinned against his body and wasn't secured in his hands until his entire body was over the boundary.
48 going out on the field making tackles with brass knuckles
NO GOING OUT OF BOUNDS EVER! 
I''m going for Alabama. I don''t know why but I don''t really like Georgia 
Replay sure looked like there was a fistful of jersey and a forearm in the neck.
We were really super pumped to not suck anymore
48 needs to calm the fuck down 
That was fuckin hilarious, the Dr Pepper commercial
Saban is not a happy camper 
false freshmen
Japan. 
Because he didn't do anything illegal
There''s no way Saban knows that 48 went after a coach
I mean this might be a slight overreaction. 
"Logic"
Pawwwwlllll. #48 On Bama did nothing wrong !!!
cuz he makes sick tackles
mechanical onesbig as najee harris i swear
Dude swung at a coach, why the fuck is he being allowed to play? 
I really think this game is just doesn't have enough TRUE FRESHMEN.
Alabama, we used to be cool, but fuck all ya'll.
nice block
JAKE FROMM!!!
He was on special teams when he threw the punch
I normally don't like complaints about the ref but you are right they are getting away with a lot. 
That's even better
Finally have a gif of 48 https://twitter.com/Deadspin/status/950578313302601728
Bet, #48 will pull a Ray Rice within the next 5 years.
TIL, it's a wild dog formation.
That didn't work last time, why would it work this time
Tuned in late....why does everyone hate #48?
Like #48, my night has also been a rollercoaster of emotions
#ROLL TIDE
What years are Tua and Fromm in?
Derrek Henry on the sidlines chillen lol
Yes, another punt!!!
48 just has too much Bama in him
Because he plays for Bama. They're allowed to do whatever they want. The Warriors of CFB.
And then tried to swing at one of the Bama coaches
Why in the hell is 48 still in this game? Just lost a lot of respect for Saban 
Can we all take a drink for UCF when Bama wins? And think about how we could've had a pure babyface national champion?
Surprised he wasn''t executed.
Screw CFA. Let's take over Indiana and go to Shipshewana.
It is actually very telling about the state of the program and game right now. That doesn't happen even a year ago with Saban.
"We've been saying true freshmen a lot tonight." THEY ARE SELF AWARE!!!
Who the hell let Brown back on the field? 
no, just fucking no
Kirby you fucking idiot
Why TF they getting all cute now!?
Chubb for a loss, SHOCKER!
Are you guys surprised that football > class in the fucking championship game? You shouldn't be
I can't take this boys
Even as a bama fan, I wish they hadn't.
I hate Jimmie Johnson... but i agree
That's game. Bad guys win again. 
o god that formation...
As long as you stay out of the shoulder pads 
Only work will suffer
buddy, not calling the false start is just as incorrect of a call as calling the offsides. What you're talking about still negates the blocked punt. It's a moot fucking point.
He shouldn''t be in the game but I thought it was clean
Win or lose Bama will be scary in the future with Tua and Najee.
As if you had any to begin with
Wtf how was that dude not cut immediately
why does georgia keep running the ball
Denied
OT plz
Chaney needs to stop running up the middle 
*Over/Under on how many times my dad has said "God Damnit" under his breath tonight.*I went to UA so I can't really count but this is still fun.
Are you saying the interception should be incomplete?  I've seen plenty of sideline plays where the receiver adjusts the ball after getting his foot down and it's a completion. How is that different other than this one being in an odd position?
Then a bad call
ono 4th down
how did he not make that
BUH GAWD THAT MAN HAD A FAMILY
And attacked a coach 
According to the rule book, I agree. They made the right call. They also made the right call with Calvin Johnson and Dez Bryant. Doesn''t mean he didn''t catch the ball.
So you can punch a coach and still play. Got it.
Wildcat is fucking stupid
Fuck 48
Not the best play call
This is how it starts
3 and out, Alabama is in business now.
Pinning the ball against your leg doesn't constitute "control". He didn't have control until he was in the air headed out of bounds. 
If you know anyone playing drinking games that were taking shots every time “true freshman” was said you need to call 911 cause they''re dead or nearly dead. 
"True Freshman"...drink!!
gg
RISE UP
The fries were disappointing, but it's the best fast food burger I've ever had.Also, Shake Shack has a better chicken sandwich than Chick Fil A, but it doesn't have a drive thru so I don't consider it fast food.
Horrible offensive possession by UGA
GO FOR IT
Just throw a damn slant smh 
Taking Fromm out of the backfield is so fucking dumb. I hate it
Georgia can't get anything on offense 
https://twitter.com/Sports_Burd/status/950578597932294146
I'm surprised #48 wasn't already sent home and his scholarship dropped
y u gettin cute?
That was a bit conservative.
Can''t believe they let that dude back on the field
Georgia should go for it.
Up the middle gets nothing
LETS GO
T R U E   F R E S H M A N
How is this dude still playing!!! Hell of a clothesline 
Lol mostly being facetious, but it is nuts how many young guys you have that are making a big difference. Is it always like this or is this a particularly strong year?
Absolutely terrible playcalling
Play of the game right here upcoming. Do they punt or go for it?!?E: Apparently I'm an idiot and should never coach football hahaha. I should probably stop drinking
Punched an uga player
I swear to fucking god JK Scott has played more games JT Barrett... is that motherfucker ever going to go to the NFL?
That is some shitty ass play calling
This fucking playcalling...
"The Tide flows."I see what you did there.
"#48 will be off the team" - Bama fans
He is not micro managing players. That is on special teams coach
The fact that Saban let 48 back on the field says everything you need to know about him and the program as a whole. Unbelievable. Any other team and that dude would be watching from the locker room right now.
Wow so predictable 
Japan..jk idk 
stop the wildcat
LETS FUCKING GOOOOO
RKO SLAM
Kirby what are you doing
Idiotic play calling. 
Nick chubb needs to be taken off the field
DAE TRUE FRESHMEN?
Yep Georgia is giving this game away. 
Whyyyy do they keep doing that?? 
That wildcat is not fooling anybody.
I think we all know how this ends
 Now is not the time to be cutesy here!!!
Serious question, did the ESPN regular broadcasters say anything about it? Coaches room kinda glossed over it...
More like can the sidelines survive an overtime 
My bad I misread it
Fuck . I don't like this.
you can't run the wildcat when you're a dog.
Running up the middle is stupid af against Alabama. 
There's literally 6 RBs playing in this game better than the starter on most schools, even the good ones...
Stop trying to get cute Georgia
Cannot believe they're running that with the game on the line
Georgia is looking like a team about to blow a lead in a big game...
LVP Nick Chubb
Fuck the wild dawg formation 
Has Chubb had a positive play tonight?
94 is a monster
Damn they just got stuffed
Oh fuck Georgia didn't get it
Georgia not doing all that sideline clowning anymore.
Yeah, his coach
Dammit man, keep it in the spoiler thread!
Oh no!  Whatever will I do?  A few crybabies on a Reddit sub I barely ever post on don't like me for having a different opinion than them!  I may as well end it all!
I could make him pretty 
Georgia bb what is u doing
Why are you taking the football out of your star QB's hand????
Go for it pls
If you haven't heard, that's Justin Guarini of American Idol fame. 
Let em play ball guys! -said the committee 
RemindMe! 30 minutes
Oh my god. Georgia's gonna shit the bed, aren't they?
Welcome to Atlanta should be playing right nowcause they are looking like the falcons
That was a legal tackle by 48
That's it. Bama wins. 
And then attacked his own coach. 
Are any true freshmen playing tonight?
**HUGE** third down stop right there
True Freshman
Uh oh.
Every time Sony Michel doesn't touch the ball this quarter, something bad happens to somebody somewhere probably. 
This game getting very interesting
It's Alabama, are you surprised? 
Should have been ejected.
Clothesline''s aren''t illegal?
Uhhhhhh... wasn't chubb
Is UGA trying to give this away?
Exactly what Bama needed
Thiccboi Payne strikes again.
I bet Georgia goes for it. Fake punt 
Keep going... 
Please don''t do this to me Dawgs
Georgia WTF are you doing
Uhhhh ohhhh UGA fans doing Anime sweats now
Silly Georgia, you cant run the clock against Saban
48 the next Burfict? 
What is a true freshman? Seems....odd
U right haha
Yep nothing wrong with that one, he didn't get the facemask (though it looked like it live)
It is and I agree it should be illegal 
I mean the dude swung at a coach
put the ball into fucking Fromm's hands, what in the actual fuck
What kind of play calling is this shit
We cant get anything down the middle. 3rd and 2? Up the middle lets go.
Oh God, Bama's going to win this fucking game
So, when running outside you use Chubb, but when running up the middle you use Sony?
He wasn't ejected?
He's Justin Guarini. Runner-up in the first season of  American Idol.
Same thought. 
It was dirty as fuck but he didn't get the collar or the facemask. A piece of shit move but technically legal. That asshole just wants to hurt someone
Don't shit talk my Baconator!
48 just took a lot of his pent up aggression on that poor Georgia player, but no one on his team wanted to congratulate him because they didn''t know if he got all of that aggression out
"We've been saying true freshman a lot tonight"quote of the night
Kirk has a true freshman boner 
Georgia going with the Oklahoma play calls to make sure they lose the game. 
Retroactively. The polls were before the bowl games back then and if they were after, UGA would have been #1.
Punch a Dawgs player right in the schnoz 
Brit
Have we mentioned we miss Deshaun Watson before? Just wanted to make sure everyone knows
Wow. Ok that was a nice defensive play 
I have such a bad feeling in my stomache right now
That's fair
If you were new to football you'd think Kirby Smart invented the wildcat
Hate that call
Someone explain to me why UGA keep playing Phantom of the Opera.
This is some ASS play calling for Georgia 
I''m starting to figure out that Bama isn''t actually any good, they''re just dirty and refs allow them to do whatever they want 
****TRUE FRESHMAN!****drank
Bama finally seems motivated 
play football good, throw ball far
He punched a dude earlier and then a coach 
He went after a coach on the sideline as well and had to be held back by a teammate 
He clotheslined him 
Yeah they did, they should have called the false start, which still negates the blocked punt. try again.
Reminder: Not every coach saw 48 try to maul their coach, and it''s not likely that coach went over to Saban to tell him that 48 attacked him during the Championship game. They needed someone to put in and they picked him.However he should have been ejected for the initial punch on the UGA player earlier 
If Bama wins it will be a long and dark offseason for this sub.
lol some commenters are 1 play ahead of me, some are 3 behind
Saban used Fourth Quarter Demon Magic!
Georgia coaches going full OU.
Go for it Kirby, steel balls 
in other news thanks dubs and go dawgs. 
**bah gawd that's 48s music!**
Well that was after he punched a Georgia player on the face
Personal fouls and attacking coaches don't matter when you can play football good roll tide

I've been plenty downvoated for it. They'd get smoked by any top 5 team and all they say is "we'll never know, game is played on the field." Their claim to fame is an unmotivated auburn. 
Why does Georgia do this bullshit where they essentially tell Bama exactly what they're going to do?
Stop saying true freshman I''m running out of beer
48 is back in the game and trying to rip  throats out
Where has Chubb been this post season? It seems like Michel is doing leagues better
Fuck michel took the wrong gap 
Alabama are the Patriots of college football. And Georgia, is from Georgia. Let's see what happens.
You got your wish.
They took the Turings computer off enigma to vote for a national champ
If he wanted to know, he'd know.
He was standing right next to him. He might have even been the target.
Dayton?  It would be weird if they were there.
I hear that they are the truest of freshmen
That is a big mother fucker.
Bama breeds winners
Michel not picking up a 3rd down? That's allowed tonight?
Go for it? Fake punt?
Oh shit here we go 
In Oregon Ducks/Beavers is a fairly friendly rivalry. But Ducks and UW fucking HATE each other.
CONNECT FOUR
Garbage play calling. Why try trickery when you''re running inside and throwing so well?
I don't understand how you throw a punch at a player, throw a punch at a coach, and then still get to play after that
Incoming message from Lincoln Riley: "Don't use the Wildcat formation. It doesn't work"
I don't agree with this gimmicky wild cat shit on your own 20. JUST RUN YOUR BREAD AND BUTTER AND STOP OVER THINKING FOR FUCK SAKEEEEEEEEEEEES
Wtf is this playcalling... 
"Don't go to Bama. You'll sit behind 5* and never see the field for 3 years..."Fuck...
Hey Georgia the wild cat isn't working. You wanna get that through your thick skull?
Tuiasusopo gonna make a dumb mistake to lose this isn't he? 
It's the sweeeeeet one!  Great commercials.  The DP10 commercials were even better.  Bold flavor!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7Dcoer2oxA
He doesn't like to lose. 
These play calls
Yep
Winning is everything...doesnt matter that he threw a punch
Punch a Georgia player then almost punched an Alabama coach on the sidelines
Got a personal foul...followed that up by taking a swing at a coach.
jesus christ the wildcat has been dead since 2008, please fucking stop it.
Who''s letting Urban Meyer run the offensive play calling for both teams?
Why was the clock running before that play? Didn't he get out on 2nd?
Well, the Refs didn't give the game to Auburn so...
He's playing right now
I blame the drinking. But thanks man, you too :)
That guy punched two different people and still gets to play LOL
they actually put 48 back on the field after he literally assaulted his own coach
We''re reaching Oklahoma Rose Bowl level playcalling here by Georgia...
Georgia with this playcalling reminds me of OU last week. 
Alabama 
Flair up.
Did you see my edit? In real time it looked questionable. 
Come on dogs, finish this dirty team!
The #momentum has swung
Yea 100% should have gone to the locker room. 
Yep
What seed was Georgia? 
For a shitty first half of football, this second half is wild
Well that series sucked.  Need to be making contact for those extra 2 yards on 2nd down.
48 about to be a true freshman in county jail after his roid rage
CAN JUST RUN OUR FUCKING OFFENSE 
Didn't 48 swing on a coach? wtf is he doing on the field?
Payne is a first round pick. Absolute monster.
Can we all appreciate that American Idol's Justin Guarini is Lil Sweet in the Diet Dr. Pepper Ads???
Dear God let this game go to OT
Brent musberger and hot chicks at games
I would rather starve to death.    For real tho they must of found some weak ass fair weather fans or maybe the Georgia-Auburn rivalry isn't as real as ours.  I mean we did fight a war over Toledo, TOLEDO, after all.  We have to teach these pansy fans how to truly hate each other.
He's back! 
Go for iiiiiit
Can you imagine having sideburns as bad as [#48 on Alabama?](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DTEn7LVU0AAKA9n?format=jpg&name=large)
Payne will play on Sundays.
OU playcalling there...
Georgia got the fear.
He lost is when he took his hands off of itthis isn't hard 
I can't handle two OT games in a row
What for the Fake please 
YESSSShhh. Let the darkside flow through you.
Halp.
In the falcons stadium no less
Stupid ass playcalling 
Every time "true freshman" is mentioned drink.
I love the consistency of Saban with discipline issues.  If you're good, you get a stern talking to, sit out 5 or 10 minutes, then get back in the game.
Couple of bad play calls. That wildcat on first down was so dumb 
 Should've gone for it.
I'm not, but I'm kinda salty about it.
It's when the defensive player pulls them down from the back of the offensive players collar. Which he didn't do. (I'm halfway through typing this and realizing you're probably talking to the thread not the refs)
I need DJ ~~Khalid~~ Khaled to authorize more servers for my stream!
was in class for end of second, all of third, heard hurts got benched?
TRUE FRESHMAN!
I was just coming on to say that it is ridiculous to play someone that hits a coach. 
Just going to guess he hasn''t seen/heard about it yet. Give him the benefit of the doubt
Jon Gruden and Spider 2 Y Banana
Just Georgia sports my guy
You're going for a team with that #48 on it?
New nickname for gundy out of the coaches room  "Gundawg" 
Why not put pass georgia is passing the ball fine..
These negative 1st downs have been killing Georgia all night. It's like watching Auburn.
Final Score: Bama - Refs. Georgia - Doesn't matter.
Offense is ice cold right now
Stuffed like my jalapeño poppers
He can''t assault the coach if he''s not on the sideline
Throwing a punch only gets you ejected in the NFL, not college
It wasn''t a horse collar...
Let the hate flow through you -Saban to #48
If bama wins I don't know what ill do
That brought the safety down into the box. Andy Reid level playcalling right there
Bama is winning it. 
You mean glorious
Remember the Kentucky player that got ejected for "touching" a ref? 
A 3 and out is fine, but Georgia CANNOT turn the ball over any more for the rest of the game if they want to win. Bama lives off that shit.
Why get cute now? 
Got too cute on that drive I don't like it
Fuck 
Have machine learning commentators gone too far?
Classic Georgia based team protocol 
Went crazy on the sideline, tried to clock his own coach 
Both. 
LOL!You gotta live in the now man. 
Has anyone else been taking shots every time they mention true freshmen? 
Taking Fromm out the formation takes away the threat of pass, a choice I don''t think is effective
Here comes 20-20. 
Georgia got the fear.
If I was that coach that was nearly assaulted I'd sue the fuck outta Alabama and Nick Saban. The fuck
tried to fight a coach after getting an unsportsmanlike earlier, threw punches
Was that just him back in the game?!?!?!
Yeah, I thought that earlier but then I realized something. He's speaking as if not everyone watching is a serious football buff... and he's probably right. Annoying for those who can spot the obvious likely enlightening for those who don't.
Just when I thought I couldn't hate Bama any more...
Really I lost a ton of respect for the Bama program over this. One guy being a punk isn't indicative of the program. Putting him back in is. 
Assistant Coach: Should we take him out of the game? He just swung at me. Sith Lord Saban: We're down 7. He *plays!*
STOP GIVING CHUBB THE BALL.
What horse collar? wasn't even close. 
Guess whoever 48 swung at on the sidelines wasn't important enough 
Get cable. 
Oh it's just bad coaching? 
Can we stop motioning out the qb 
RIP
Man I feel like I''m missing out without Cookout. I Trust you guys with how good it is. Looking at a job in Georgia and it''s near the top of my list of reasons to take it. 
i understand that but it doesnt make that play dirty. i agree fuck 48 though
I will never understand teams that get conservative vs great teams whether it's in the NFL or college. It always seems to backfire.
[deleted]
Hell of a punt
Saban is about to lose his shit here after a true freshman puts the ball on the ground.
fuck, my heart again
Georgia''s center is not great 
Oh no Georgia,What you doing?
ThAt iS a TrUe FreShMAn!!!!
[48 making another appearance like](https://imgur.com/gallery/JpWsECN)
My liver!
I don''t think Kirby calls the plays on offense 
Psst.. UGA, last drive was the one you were supposed to sandbag. You need insurance points now
Stupid. Fucking. Call. 
Georgia has to get a turnover this drive. 
You trying to kill me??
He didn't have full control of it. That shouldn't be a catch. You need to have full control in bounds. Otherwise he could catch it for a second and a defender could make a good play and knock it out and it would still be a catch. Close to being a catch but he bobbled it. End of story 
Can't help but feel like the Bama fans are gonna start posting on here again after their 3 quarters of silence
Fuck your conservative playcall. Fuck that rise up comment. 
Fuck Bama and their lack of moralsWhat other team would let 48 back in
I've already made the decision to call-in sick to work tomorrow. I can't decide whether overtime would be great because I can watch it or horrible because it makes it obvious why I've called-in.I'm going for overtime. Fuck it.
lol. He's a first round pick. 
The fever...the rage...
Wow lol, what a little bitch
94 is such a beast 
Tua and Fromm might be true freshmen, but Sam Darnold is a leader on and off the field
And die of alcohol poisoning
I don't get the point of that commercial. A bunch of southerners eat some free fried chicken and they manage to not start murdering each other? Big deal. 
Hey now.
OH BOY, WE GOT A BUTT CLENCHER
I hate Jim Chaney so much.
Kirk Herbstreit is 2018 Verne Lundquist
SEC offense is such shit
^^^
Lol yup
The new Burfict - bonecrunching hits, but no brains behind the player.
Georgia is gonna choke this thing away.
If we win there's going to be 6 more weeks of winter
Dude, we don't want people to DIE.
After swinging at a coach? You are kidding right? edit* and a Georgia player, there is literally no excuse for that kid playing.
Don't worry, after this game #48's career is over.
And we'll get to see Tua in all the preliminary Heisman articles jerked around everywhere
But ... I don't want to die ...
Well, that was an uninspired playcall. 
These play calls.
I would think you would want to stay in bounds and wind down the clock faster
Ah shit here comes Bama
To be fair this is the SEC where penalties basically don''t exist
true freshmen can't drink
He was not only let back in the game after punching a coach, but he clotheslined the return man like Randy Fucking Savage. 
He punched a Georgia player and didn''t get kicked out. Then he swung on one of the assistant coaches. Then he got back in the game and clotheslined someone. Then I finished a bowl of cereal. 
Just because he readjusted and wasn't touching it doesn't mean he didn't have control. Might be a stretch of a comparison, but if you flip a ball from your right hand to your left hand, does that mean you don't have control?
Polynesian and milkshake is a must. 
The rarest College Football BINGO space: Player punches a player, coach, water girl, avoids arrest, is back in the game in 20 minutes
Predicion: Bama will get stopped but a flag extends the drive 
immediately puts a just-barely-legal hit on first play back
Why you think that kid passed out???
Usually the people who spell the word like that think Football is the sport where you constantly kick a ball
More like 2011 dude 
How many true freshmen have played in this game?
Is Hurts putting his helmet on and coming in? 
Oh boy, it's another Alabama pulls a win from their collective ass episode. 
I''m down for some OT ball
It'll be a long and dark offseason, regardless.  Football is always better than no football.
Everytime a redshirt freshman is confused for a true freshman, drink 
It's nice to see Bama giving their varsity team some playing time here in the second half
Can you imagine being as fucking classless as him either? Such a disgrace to the program
3-5 times a week is enough. 
As if you had any to begin with
Literally every other player playing tonight is in the same scenario and have more composure. 
Why georgia?
was that supposed to be vampire teeth on 94's mouth guard? lol
#3 IIRC.
Y'all know what's about to happen
My favorite part of espn live streams is when it shows the beginning of something crazy about to happen, and then it skips the entire play
Too fancy. Fromm has been money all game on 3rd down
We're counting on you Georgia.
yeah, I'm thinking I overestimated Saban's character. winning > all. 
9 people in the box because why not? Not gonna throw. Fucking stupid play call against bama
Play defense dawgs
non-SEC fans finally seeing the real saban 
Lol
I''m already wasted doing this in the past 5 mins
1. it's the wild dawg thank you very much2. they scored a TD on it earlier though
Bama bout to do Bama things
Because he controlled it. It stopped moving while in his possession while he was in the field of play. He jumping it up into his hands out of bounds was evidence over his control over the ball.  That''s not the rule. But that''s doesn''t mean I agree with the rule. It was ruled correctly but it was a catch in my book. 
He was the Runner-Up too!
No, but he should have been. Then he should have been benched for punching a coach
No I''m saying it should have been complete. I''m saying if they believe that was incomplete the butt catches and catching on someone''s back should have been too. 
94 for Bama again, they haven't had an answer for that guy.  
Hey Bama, plz mess up. 
That was bad. Tight buttholes.
Inexperience pressure interception coming right here 
Imagine if another Georgia team blows a big lead in a championship game...
This thread is going way too fast.
I wish Romo could call every single football game. He would do better than these ESPN jackasses.
What up Captain Obvious!!
Why would you put it into the hands of the best quarterback in the stadium when you can get cute? 
Yeah, most likely. They overblew it from the announcer's booth. 
Anyone playing the drinking game for "true freshman" tonight, better just go ahead and call in sick now.
Terrible play calling 
He punched a coach, I don't know what teams you've been on but that's usually a one way ticket off the team.
[deleted]
UGA OC: Hmmm the wild dog didn't work...  I know! Let's do the same play again! 
And there he is on special teams.
I'm driving home after this game, you're trying to kill me :(
Dude tried to fight a coach on the sidelines
It's nice to see Bama giving their varsity team some playing time here in the second half
Dickie V and Diaper Dandy
Ahem! "Wild dog."
Agreed...they were having success with Michel
Larry ez
3
so close to sleeping on it
Georgia... what were those play calls though
I can't really blame Saban for keeping 48 in, you want to win the national championship, you can punish him later
They let him back in the game!
Dilly dilly! 
Yeah and no class apparently 
On the 20? Yeah that'll go over great if they don't get it. 
Damn, 48 just took out all His anger he had on that Coach, on that kick returner. Tackle straight out of the UFC
Man Bama is now fucking S-tier hated teams now. Neck and neck with New England. You really can''t justify putting 48 back in. No less, that tackle he made really should have been a penalty.
GEORGIA DO NOT LET THEM BACK
Well now I want T-bell but obviously I can't drive.
Did I just hear Johnny Football mentioned?!
Random thought: Would playing with no helmets help the concussion issue?
What a dumb play call..
I miss him so much
Thanks Harvard
pls Georgia don't fuck this up
And every Falcons fan watching is starting to get some ugly flashbacks
\#killthecommercials
Despite Alabama not having an offense the first half, they are doing pretty well
What kind of playcalling is that?
Taco Bell queso dip is overrated
Jesus Christ just fuck my shit up fam
Fucking insane
THE BEST IN COLLEGE FOOTBALL
Can Confirm
Stop doing all that weird shit every play. All you're doing is losing a blocker
This live feed on mobile is useless it''s constant scrolling
Fuck this getting cute shit
Dude, just let Fromm handle the game
I threw up in my mouth a bit 
Tell that to Oklahoma
Yes. 
I don''t like this for my under 
They've probably never played a sport in their life. 
Did you know both QB's are true freshman
Let's meme this into reality:Scoop and Score
Georgia is gonna lose this one
C'mon Dawg Defense
My sideburns are like that until like a week when I grow a beard. My beard is complete now, but it's dogshit for a bit
Lmao we scored 50 on OU
[deleted]
Cant wait to see what Manti Teo's girlfriend can do here
We would have shat on Alabama.
I only have 12 beers left tho.
LMAOOOOO 
SEC defense is damn good.
Put the Wildcat/dog/bird away until next fall.
Stop with the wildcat
In the words of Sir Charles, that was "turrible" playcalling
Whataburger 
We meaning the audience watching. 
\#48 has gotten away with a punch, a clothesline, and with trying to fight a coach. Alabama football: molding quality young men, unless it reduces chances of winning in any way.
DID YOU GUYS KNOW THAT BAMA IS PLAYING A TRUE FRESHMAN AS QB
I wanna see 48 go back on the field just so he can get laid the fuck out
On your own 20?Are you ducking high?
If that's really the case and they are the ones keeping that campaign alive then I'm going to turn into a men's rights activist just over this.
Georgie needs to stop playing cute and just do what they've been doing. It's like watching the Chiefs/Titans game
This is what playing to lose looks like. Atlanta fans should recognize it
Interesting that Georgia took the ball out of Fromm''s hands there. I would think you''d want to stick with what''s been working, and the pass game has been much stronger than the run game.
Damn I thought they might not go to a commercial there. Silly me
COMMERCIALS!
PAC 12 is such shit 
I ubered here on purpose and got my beer. Win win. 
I thought I wasn't going to experience a Falcons game till Saturday. Don't you fucking do this to me, Georgia.
Sometimes you just don't need to get cute and just telegraph that it's 100% a running play coming.
PADDINGTON
Georgia fans I'm a Chiefs fan and you are looking awfully like the Chiefs on Saturday.
I want MOAR COMMERCIALS!!!  D:
We are all in 2018
So fucking done with all the ads 
I know what happens next, MSST made the same mistake this year.
Chaney is scared, getting too cute.
Saban told him  "you got 1 play to redeem yourself" 
as is georgia sports tradition
Da best offense issa gud defense
I want this to be a close game but I still want Bama to lose. First world problems...
the fuck is paddington
"Battled back" Is a weird way to spell "given literally every call this game to allow them to score some points"
TRUE
This right here. I don''t fault them for putting him in. I highly doubt more than 25% of the team/staff know what happened with him. 
And I will watch. What a dude.
guys this entirely legal stream I'm watching is about 30 seconds behind. Can you all wait half a minute to post your reactions to whats happening so I can feel included? Thanks. edit: you guys are assholes
Can you imagine getting shutout in the CFP?
Making it clear why Saban let him back on. Football matters above anything at the moment
I was thinking the same thing.  
**WE SHOULD TAKE ALABAMA AND PUSH IT SOMEWHERE ELSE**
The worst possible time to go 3 and out. Chaney what are you doing?
Fuck Bama from here until forever for letting a player who hit another player, then an assistant on the sideline back into the fucking game.How low of a piece of shit are you really Saban?  
Eye bleach please
Georgia trying to run clock a bit too soon 
Wild Dawg twice, they sold out on zero coverage and we couldn't do a thing but run it right at them....
That stacker box is a killer deal 
For a second there, it looked like Diggs was going to escape 5 Georgia special teams who had him surrounded.
It''s fucking annoying 
I'm having Mike Bobo flashbacks 
He punched a coach. He should lose his scholarship. Getting angry on the field can get penalties. Assault on the sideline is a whole different thing.
23-20 Bama, because we can''t call plays properly. Fuck my life.
God has abandoned us
No sign of Hurts. FeelsBadMan
His team would fight and die for him!
Isn't Chubb your bruiser back and Michel your shifty guy?
Gettin paid, getting paid
I'm irrationally angry about so many things this game. The reffing, Saban deciding to keep a kid who tried going at one of his coaches
Falcons didn't go conservative in the Superbowl and look where that got them.
At halftime
petition to start an american rugby league please
Comcast fucking my ESPN stream up cause of net neutrality. 
Roquan, win us this game plz
I hope you all are enjoying this in the moment. We have about 8 months of *offseason* ahead of us...
3
*SEC defense is the shitFTFY
Actually I did, not anymore.  I coach kids and if one took a swing at any coach they would never play again for us.  Yes I am an internet tough guy. 
You spelled Bama wrong.
Nobody playing a drinking game for "True Freshman" could've ever seen three true freshmen playing in this game. 
Who the fuck watches paddington 
These commercials are annoying as fuck 
I missed the water girl
wouldnt have it any other way
Please...Chick-fil-a is a a good Georgia institution, and only serves Coke.  Chicken and Coke can save the world.
It is known 
He plays for bama, of course he will
nice
I''ve been in high pressure situations and played football. Never felt the need to swing at a coach. That dude has no place in college football.
My dog just woke up after smelling it's own fart. not a good sign for Georgia
Georgia gonna choke it away. Just do it quick so I can go to bed
Buttcheeks starting to clench in Georgia
Honestly what did they expect running up the middle again?
Ugh.  Georgia is going to choke this away, aren't they?
[removed]
4th and 1? Better punt
This may be the wrong sub to bring this up in... but Shake Shack makes a superior chicken sandwich to Chick Fil AEDIT: This will be what I'm remembered for... and I couldn't be more proud.
Is it supposed to be a shrimp?
Outstanding. 
False start on the defense on a punt without a neutral zone infraction... hmmm
Good lord. How wasn't he sent to the locker room? That's a real bad look for Bama. Edit: I hope recruits parents see this. That's not right at all.
There's so many comments nobody will see i have a thing for big women
I don''t understand. Why would you do a running play that isn''t even disguised as anything. Wildcat is a joke and they are going to lose for it.
Stop running that goddamn play, it doesn't work
Fuck
Quick boys, run it up the middle!!! This has worked.... not a single time
Clemson + Cal = Paddington
Seriously If Alabama wins the refs better get rings too
This fucking commercial again...
Took a swing at a coach and had an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty called and yet remains in the game. 
So I thought Chubb was supposed to be really damn good, but don't see you guys play much. What's the deal with him 
Yeah, I saw this game 11 months ago. Fuck.
Run it in space. So stupid. This is like some Woody Hayes bullshit. 
this is the first sammy comment i have seen tonight
Saw him play Vanderbilt game. I knew he was the chosen one.
You're offense isn't good. OU's defense is just that fucking bad
Dude ...we closing in on Oklahoma and Texas..You guys are next.
SOME MILD RUDE HUMOR!
A true freshman QB, never started, comes in and claws us back in this game. I'm fucking impressed.
Georgia baby, what is you doing. Don't fuck this up for the rest of us 
Please
Why did the younger Briles just get a job? Why is Tyreek hill still in the league? Why did Greg hardy make multiple probowls ?  Football trumps character so many times over it's horrifying. 
I'm sorry, had to go salt the driveway :P
Yep, that's how we scored 54 points vs oklahoma
plot twist- the coach actually started the fight with 48 and has since been fired and murdered simultaneously
SABAN KNOWsdOES NOT CARE
Gutless playcalling.  Taking notes from the Atlanta Falcons in last years Superbowl 
thanks
Duke hoops 
That offense beat Baker Mayfield''s offense score wise last week.
Neither have you obviously
I''m starting to think I picked a bad time to quit drinking. What am I supposed to relieve stress with?!
BIG STOP. This is getting good.
Thaaaat's why he's so angry...
We tried but now I''ve got three dead friends.  
I don't wanna die. 
Could probably play better defense that a pac12 defense /s
If youre going to surprise bama with the wilddawg, you have to make it a surprise....
Username checks out
:(
Commercials are fucking killing the hype levels of this game. Fuck your Nissan!
Stop being so cute GA
Classless of Saban to put 48 back in, he should have already been ejected and kicked off the team for the shit he pulled.
Kirby “Not So” Smart
Clotheslining is a legal tackling technique
For the true freshman 
dawgs getting cheated, 48 should've been ejected 
Amazing performance by both.  Had no idea.  
Agreed. Kinda shows that they put winning above everything else
Random rules question: why is it that sometimes when a player steps out of bounds the clock stops until the next play, and sometimes the clock just stops for a little bit and then restarts after a delay?
If Georgia loses this game, it'll be because they wouldn't put the ball in Fromm's hands on third down. 
A Paddington 2 commercial?  Are football fans really the target demo for that film?
The Falcons didn't get conservative and look what happened to them
You mean the Wild Dawg™?
And he wouldn't have it any other way...
4 national championships later 
hot take
Which is why 2 SEC teams are in the championship game, obviously.
Wtf there was a Paddington 1?
is that Stefons brother
Female?
Vintage Chaney... can''t stand it sometimes
Lol he's back on the field already!?
No one should be surprised Brown is in the game. Nick Saban has only ever cared about winning. He'll throw a player aside immediately if it'd help him win (Hurts), and he'll let a player get away with trying to punch a coach if it'd help him win (Brown). He doesn't care about doing the "right thing".
Will the Georgia curse continue.  Got a feeling they blow it like the Falcons did last year.  Passing game was on fire and they went away from it. 
Didn't they make enough money from ticket sales?
We got this now. 
playing not to lose... going to get rolled
How were you downvotes for that? Lol seemed like an asshole way to tackle someone
yes but it would make the fractured skull issue worse 
#2 I believe 
Looking at the replay I can see it was clean but in real time didn't look that way 
drinking game every time they say true freshman take a shot
Terrible play calling by GA
[removed]
Defeat snatched from the jaws of victory. 
The dude is dirty. The team is dirty. The refs are dirty. That hit was dirty. The only thing classy about this game is Georgia.
Saban was standing right next to him when it happened. 
No Fromm has been humanAnd stellar on 3rd down
...fear that refs don't care if some of the players end up paralyzed. 
yeah that was weak
Well that too.
The wild dog needs to stop
Wtf, did David Shaw take over play calling for Georgia?
Someone needs to bring Taco Bell down a peg. 
geogia snatching defeat from the jaws of victory
Which the commentators have yet to note...maybe if he grabbed his crotch it''d be all we hear about for weeks? Fucking Bama
If they have then I think you''re the only one left that can still function 
T:'(
As someone who doesn't have skin in the game, I'm okay with that. 
Is that Logan Paul? 
So when is Payne declaring so we can draft him?? 
Well y''all it''s been fun. Clearly you have to have the money to pay off refs to win the ship
Mississippi should annex bama
wild dog***
Don't worry, we've beent taking care of him for you.  (outside that one little accident he had) I fucking love Watson, the dude is special and can't wait to see him lead us to more wins next season. 
Gotta get that win first I guess. *#priorities*
#TRUEFRESHMAN
And it doesn't even have good ratings
.....but......but.......tua time tho
I SAID THIS LAST GAME AGAINST OU. HAVE FAITH DAWG FANS!!! 
Hard to believe GA will blow it and Bama who shouldn't even be in the game will win the "championship" AGAIN.  Zzzz.
nice try drake.
I saw it
Chubb killed Oklahoma, had about 150 yards.Michel just got the biggest plays and touchdowns on his calls.

Something about those Georgia teams
Ain't no shame in that.

I don't think I'm biased, I just don't like how no one know what a catch is anymore.
T r U e F r E s H m A n
Why did they have to run that play -__-
I seen it!
I was amazed the kid was let back on the field. Nah it's cool if you try and fight your coach and push the lady trainer out of your way. Yikes
When will cfb come to Netflix so there won't be commercials? 
Bama wins with final minute touchdown..
ewww
So is Chipotles queso. I love everything Chipotle. But their queso sucks. 
Agreed
If Georgia could call some runs outside the A gap with Michel, they might find some success
Damn it, they're gonna get away with it again aren't they?
Sadly yeah, momentum seems solidly on Bama's side right now
You're just not accustomed to a decent defense.
Me too man
pls Georgia fuck this up
*wild dawg
He didn't
Come on, Bane! Natural disaster, indoor flash flood, or something. We are running out of time! 
Does Saban dare go for two if they score with little time left?
HOW DO THEY EVEN PLAY THIS GAME WHAT WITH BEING A FRESHMAN AND EVERYTHING 
I did.
I believe it''s UCF
It was horrible. 
There's just something about teams from Georgia that have leads in Championship games.
Dammit UGA don''t do me like this. I''ve had enough disappointment this season
Assistant coach off the team incoming
Punched a GA player after the play. Coach said something in passing to him on side line, he took a swing at said coach. Then on kickoff he closelines the guy for a tackle and he's the hero again. Rollercoaster kind of night for this fella
A bear
I saw. 
Go on...
Me too...
https://twitter.com/Deadspin/status/950578313302601728
I don''t think so. Just mentioned the sound of the reaction from the UGA fans
And other players also. RBs, linemen, just all different freshman. Thanks Herby
chubby chaser exposedtagged
BBW?
Ain't nothing wrong with that
Georgia offense looked pretty good against Oklahoma. Maybe the defenses are just really good. 
I need to know who she is
Wee in the south? That''s hard to believe. Even the women at my wife''s work have an opinion and rooting interest for this game!
I've just been taking shots. Didn't realize there were rules!
I seent it
Best I can tell, bama cares about winning more than having players who represent what the sport means.
*Any other team except successful ones in the national championship game.
Yeah you ‘member when JFF beat Bama?
I think getting kicked off the team for nearly assaulting a coach is a fairly standard punishment. Intense game or not, there are limits.
He got off the block and made a great play, he didn't hit his neck. It was a completely legal tackle. Y'all just all super soft lol its football
I don''t think #48 knows da wae
48's check from the boosters not clear or something?
*wild dawg
No way! Aliens landed on the field! Crazy!!!!
Let's hope
Shhhh
Wow, really? Did you know they are young too?
Everyone has their preferences. 
When did he get a female?  Totally missed that.
Punched a Georgia player and then one of his coaches on the sideline after an unsportsmanlike penalty.
Definitely a fire sandwich, but way too expensive for what you get
you woulda thought after taking a swing at a georgia player than one of his own coaches brown would have played his last down for the tide
"That Nissan rogue really impressed me" - Said no Biker ever
The Homers broadcast with Joe Tess has so much more energy than the main channel
I'd hold Jennifer Garner's hand in public.
*Bama player takes out a knife and stabs Jake Fromm in the throat*Bama fans: "Uhh feel bad for us cause we had a bad season in 2007"
I knew when I heard about Georgia's championships being 38 years apart it was destiny tonight.
All around me are familiar faces 
Yeah I can't lie, 48 has some decent Sambo.
I've been there, you just gotta wait for commercial to refresh
I always hope to see the opposite but it happens way too much for you to be wrong. It''s inevitable at this point.
Not sure about mobile, but desktop has reddit-stream.com
God I hope so
Clock runs on out of bounds now (stops until set for play, but then starts with the play clock). Changed maybe 2 or 3 years ago. Stops for good in the last 2 minutes of the half. Wanted to make the games move faster.
We have to quit with our scared and conservative play calling
Those unlimited tenders aren''t half bad btw. 
How big we talkin' about?
Do what makes you happy man, life is too short.
That's nice
why must you say things like this
They have been for 5 years what do you mean?
Nah tackle was clean.
right? stupid. 
I mean, yes? When you are inside your own 30.
From your own 23 when you''ve been getting stuffed? Absolutely.
That's different, their defense decided to go away.
Yo T-Bell, bring back that Baja chalupa and we'll talk.
It's really uncanny. The only difference is that if we go to overtime, I actually like our chances. 
Literally no other team. 
Paddington bear?
**TUA TIME**
48 has dirt on Saban. My guess is he recorded one of the Halftime Freshman Sacrifices and is threatening to go public with it.
I'm watching the ESPN game sound stream, what happened? 
I got you famhttps://i.imgur.com/Vzcpbxo.gifv
Looked dirty but it was clean 
That's the commercials
How is the Taco Bell stacker not just a folded quesadilla? Why is it it's own thing?
48 just needed some commitment, compassion and comraderie. He just needed a quick boost with Butters' Creamy Goo™
Georgia playing not to lose. Congrats on your National Championship Alabama.
HOLY MOLY
She got dem crazy eyes
Chubb has 10 yards on 20 carries up the middle. What should we do? Run Chubb out of the wild cat up the middle
This ain't basketball bubba
Well Saban had to be happy with it lol
I won''t lie. Taco Bell cheese dip goes hard when your drunk. It''s processed as fuck though. The decisions
Georgia playing to not lose the game....this rarely works lol. 
Heartbreak inbound.
Georgia is kinda choking, aren't they?
The wildcat is a gimmick that never should be ran. Everyone has figured out how to stop it. Only works every now and then.
Who is this capital one girl 
Not letting this slide sorry
I missed it.  Any gif evidence?
It's too late for all that nonsense 
True freshmen you say? Both? You'd think the commentators would mention that. 
"internally handled"
Is it sad that I actually want Bama to win because that would be funny?
RIP everyone.
Same dude that punched a Georgia player then swung at a coach on the sidelines 
Big boobie ladies, covered in cozy blankets, ushering you in while prince plays quietly.
It was a silent protest
Just look at how Saban deals with discipline issues on and off the field.  It's standard fare to have token punishments for key players.  Watch, he'll probably say he's making the player run until he pukes tomorrow and he'll be good after that.
Who rates it highly? It's unquestionably horrible
Please please please pressure this freshman qb on this drive, make him panic 
My mom just insulted Gundy''s mullet.
No but did you hear both QBs are true freshmen
Only the 2nd Wildest thing tonight after the Leafs Choking a 2-0 lead to the Blue Jackets in Toronto tonight and losing in OT. 
Doesnt have to be helmet to helmet and it doesnt matter if its incidentalDo *you* know the rules? 
Lmaooo. You gotta be fuckig trolling 
UGA playing not to lose. Very bad for them
Dawgs will pull failcons and lose. 
You got a death wish, son?
But they'll feel it. 
No please, do this.
Then goes out and clothesline tackles a guy
Only 30 seconds behind? No way is that a legal stream :D
Instead of possibly giving Alabama on the 20 when you have the lead? Smart play.
Not only are these QBs fresh, they are indeed true.
Our defense needs to show the fuck out right here.
Paddington MVP
i think Hurts is heading back in, he was getting his helmet on.edit -- im wrong
This is looking like a Georgia heartbreaker
When the QB hands the ball off he normally doesn''t block. At least in this formation he is occupying a defender. 
He''s so obviously better than Jalen. It''s not even a competition 
Made a good tackle on the 15 i''ll take it
Chick Fil A is vastly overrated.
nervousbulldog.jpg
Jennifer Garner is like the Yuppie Final Boss
Saban better give Tua a hug if they win this
Starts running after they set it. Only stops for good inside 2 minutes
Let's go lefty qb, YOU CAN DO IT
If not this game, what game is it appropriate to go apeshit? Flag football next weekend? He''s wrong he fucked up. He will pay for it. 
All the makings of fucking Alabama winning it. Like the Patriots only much more unnerving
Did you know that Joshua Dobbs is an Engineer? 
Wouldn't be the Georgia I've known most of my life if they didn't blow it in spectacular fashion.
Relevant username
It''s close enough now. Just root for Georgia
Fuck and I''m a falcons fan
Ben Affleck fucked up
STOP RUNNING IT UP THE MIDDLE WHAT ARE YOU DOING
UGA #24 gonna get a pick 6
HOLY MOLY
Dats nasty yo
DID YOU KNOW GEORGIA IS AS WELL?!?!?!
Then that would have been a losing football team. Ever wonder why discipline is always one of the top goals of coaches? 
You're just asking to be 48'd.
I can't
It was lowkey pretty good
I do too!
Not enough tight end fades
Bama played the first three quarters?
no
Even Urban Meyer wouldn't do that
I know brother, it hurts me too
Paddington 2 looks dope af
Alabama = New England Patriots of college footballGeorgia = a football team from the state of Georgianuff said. Roll tide
And Sam Darnold wouldn't want it any other way. 
Currently 100% on rottentomatoes
Odds Saban has zero idea about 48s attempt to hit a coach?
Is this when we remember that Georgia is still a Georgia sports team?
And the QB Bama pulled from the game has a .926 win % as starter!
or atleast throw the ball once, but that will never happen
I saw it
Chiefs fan?
Holy hell I''ve been asleep what the hell happened?
The bama way.
How the hell did he not get ejected for throwing a clean punch on one of our players, though?
Probably not, but some football fans have kids.
To run down the clock?
Wendy's spicy chicken sandwich > all
Then Baker Mayfield sucks according to your logic.
I wish Herbie would call out 48 being back in the game. 
Yea it was a cinematic masterpiece
Chubb doesn't have it. They need to ride Michel into the sunset tonight.
3rd
Aaaaaaand he's back in.
I''m rooting for Georgia, and I know that was a rough tackle, but what exactly about it warranted a penalty? He didn''t grab the facemask
A decade ago yes, now not likely. Also CTE is the main issue, which is like thousands of tiny concussions needing prevented. 
He''s a bear. What the fuck is a Lommy?
Apparently not.
I haven't seen many UCF fans in here tonight. Either they are all partying or they are protesting this game.
UGA WE ARE ALL ROOTING FOR YOU
A lot of ads for a Kendrick concert 
Saban wins at any cost.. 
He hit a girl?!
WHAT? That's him? 
Why on earth would you call that a pick it was obviously jumbling around.
Oh shit, I missed that, thanks.
I cannot stand these Jennifer Garner commercials. Enough already
The wild dog bullshit is gonna lose Georgia the game
What is Georgia doing.
Name a sports play more dull than the punt return. You can't.
Complete idiot, totally embarrassing himself, and the kid is a special teams player and BACKUP linebacker 
Sam Darnold wouldn't want it any other way.  Watching the natty from his couch.
No
Georgia is trying to get too cute and they're going to lose this game. The defense needs to bail them out.  Put some pressure on this kid at QB.
Yeah he did, and almost attacked a coach. No he's ruling st
I'd put that on Saban too. Dude should be out peeling potatoes in the kitchen.
Hopefully they cram them all in now so they can end it without any. 
It''s like Whataburger in Texas and In ‘N Out Burger in California... people grow up with it, they love it. Especially if they''re denied that love 1 day of the week
If we go by how many times Fowler and Herbie have said "true freshman," about 80 give or take.
Yes
Clock runs after every play until the last five minutes I think.
Yep. He just made a tackle. 
Why UGA getting cute. Everyone knows no one but Fromme is gonna throw the ball.
anyone have a count? more commercials than game?
the facial expression Jennifer Garner makes in that episode is so fucking annoying
GTFO.
Nissan: “look we can''t afford a beck song and have beck be in the commercial, just find a look alike”
*Khaled
They have the best people. 
Buckle up. Here comes the final push from Bama.
Georgia, you need a Pick Six right now
There are lots of triggered SEC fan boys in here. Say the SEC has shit offense, which is clearly true, and they all freak the fuck out. Pretty hilarious to see
I married one my man it''s worth
I did 
Swing and a miss 
Too risky with that field position not to.
That is literally impossible
How is #48 still playing AFTER THROWING A PUNCH AT A COACH?!?
We''re going to blow it. Why are we trying to be fancy?! We needed two yards for the first down. Fuck off, Jim Chaney!
*clicks furiously*
They all dead
Hell most teams he'd be cut
I''m a Chiefs and Sooners fan. I had a terrible week. 
It's certainly possible. Similar to how boxing causes far more damage to the head because of the use of thick gloves as opposed to UFC's fingerless gloves
But how many missing college football reporters have they saved?
They're usually not dirty. 48 is a piece of shit and Mack Wilson made an uncharacteristic move when he tackled Fromm. Tony Brown is really their only player who has been pretty dirty in the past
He threw a punch at a Georgia player, then went after one of his coaches after he got pulled. 
No trophy for high moral character on the sideline. We don't have all the information and who is to say he won't be punished after the fact. If he gives you best chance to win then why handicap your team and punish the rest of the roster?
Spit. Spit on him my brudda
I see you ;)
Amazing how coaches completely abandon their normal play calling, that's been working, on big pressure drives 
PADDINGTON 2 CURRENTLY HAS 100% ON RT
I just wanna go to bed..... please hold them off dawgs 
They did just that. 
My man!
100% not even close
Georgia suddenly got conservative with the playcalling on that drive.  Like they're playing not to lose, rather than playing to win.
Jim Chaney can go fuck himself with this conservative play calling. That will let Alabama win the game
Can Georgia handle both the Falcons and Bulldogs doing this in the span of a year
Big girls need love too...
Hug and a tug
NO THE DOME DIED FOR THIA
Jennifer Garner?
Imagine if 48 ran off the field and leaped on Saban and just started ripping his face off 
Is paddington the best ad during this time?
With the Dingo Formation staring you in the face, you go and fuck it up by calling it the Wild Dawg? 
Yea but we've started Fromm all year
Nice 
The clock stops on a first down while the refs move the chains, then starts again as soon as the chains are set.
Why not? They cleared whatever was wrong up I bet and he made a play
He just got back in the game. That's fucking terrible. 
An auburn fan wants UGA to win?
Arrests for drugs, guns, etc. Doesn't matter if you're good to them.
State farm
There isn't a wrong sub to bring that up
this is actually happening. this is actually happening. if we blow a 20-7 lead im giving up football
Cool, Georgia has entered the "play to not lose" section of the play book, so now they're going to lose. 
Alabama is performing like a team that couldn''t even win it''s own division, let alone their conference or a national title game.....
Jennifer Garner
Lol that''s a good joke
Why do I have this familiar sinking feeling?
Outrageous opinion incoming: I could listen to Jennifer Garner whisper credit card offers to me all night.  
Jimmy Johnson still races dude. Won 5 nattys in the 00''s. 
Pretty please
H O L Y M O L Y
Jennifer Garner in Whisper Mode is still fucking annoying. 
Honestly with our limping defense, it would be impressive  if we won, seriously 
Can we finish this fucking game...
Saying that in the south is like slapping someones mother
I don't know if I want you to lose or for an Atlanta team to blow another lead in a championship.
Saban doesn't seem to care
It's crazy that you're not being all that hyperbolic.
you'd think they would have added something more to their prep cards
Saban will sho him da wae
You're basically asking "is anyone on this thread dead?"
How?
Ah okay 
spit on him bruddas
Yeah but who actually *thinks* about this shit man, we''re all about hot takes here!
Surprisingly decent
Lol that would mean Bama has character standards lol
Can't waste that scholarship money.
I disagree 
I think they go after Dabo first. 
I'd try and make Jennifer Garner yell like that in a library
Fuck the whole state of Alabama!!  Even Forrest Gump! ^^^^am ^^^^I ^^^^doing ^^^^it ^^^^right?
And because Chubb sucked major ass all night.
He's doing better with you guys, but that was defintely the Chaney we had.
Maybe part of it is me looking back on drunken nights of undergrad but holy shit it's perfect. Reasonably priced. Tasty. You can have a fuckin quesadilla as your side. Mmm.
Damn, Jennifer Garner looking good. Real good. 
I don't like this one bit
[deleted]
Why don't you schedule a date at any time except noon on a work day?
BBW! Do your thing boiiii
Big women and some fruit snacks ;)
Nah, the ball was clearly not secured until the player was fully out of bounds with both feet on the white.  The confirmed call was absolutely right, even if people who are biased would question it.
LEADING RECEIVER TOO!
I'm having flashbacks to 2012 and it is not fun
They always say that when Bama gets a key stop. Idk why, but I find it annoying, too
DEM SOUTHERN BOYS LOVE BRIGHT COLORS AND LOTS OF MOVEMENT TRUST ME ON DIS. 
Then we get into a pads vs bare skull issue.  You're going to end up with a lot of torn skin and cracked skulls.Blood everywhere.
People order !burger sandwiches at Shake Shack?!
We'll see, bama still has to win a Natty first to be mentioned alongside them
I bet he gets suspended when Saban hates about it later. 
As do I 
I mean, they did score with it...
Hi
You mean tug right
Culvers is better yet.
Jennifer Garner seems smug as fuck
Fucking 4 hour game. With the same 10 ads every commercial break. Fuck 
Not like this... 
just like utah ):
Why is it doing the “right thing” to leave in a player that is not performing? Because it''s nice?
I got work tomorrow I don''t wanna die 
it would force players to tackle properly, part of the reason there are less concussions in rugby 
Whataburger > what you said.
Yeah but it's twice as expensive. Like five guys makes a better burger than in n out but I can get a high quality double double for only $4
GA is a cursed sports state.
Jeremy Pruitt likes putting Tzatziki Sauce on banana pudding. 
No more direct tv commercials 
So is Calvin Ridley on the same level of like Amari Cooper when it comes to NFL prospects? I've seen him get mocked in the late first for some teams 
Cmon Bama!!!!If I can't be happy about these playoffs no one can!!!! (I mean, except Bama fans unfortunately, but thats worth it for the salt) 
Oscar snub
When Netflix pays hundreds of millions of dollars for the rights. 
No.  Positive thoughts.
Assistant to the coach*
That call was Malzahnesque
If I hear one more person shout "HOLY MOLY THATS A LOT OF MILES"....
I feel the same way. 
It''s like they didn''t even watch OU last week.
The kick return, statistically 
Kickoff 8 yards deep
Who?
Until the next kick off...
Just like I just said to some other guy, their defense disappeared in the second half. Completely different. Georgia's D is still playing well.
I smell OT followed by a Bama victory
PUT THE HECKIN BALL BACK IN FROMMS HADS. FRICK THE WILDCAT. 
Art and masterpiece are 2 words that should never be used to describe anything from Taco Bell 
She''s a milf tho
LMAO!
Saban is showing hes a pushover
Are you the same guy who said they love their girlfriend earlier?
You naughty boy 
Don''t ask him if he wants a second, he might lose it
You relieve it with hope
Annnnnnnnd he's back.
These DirectTV bites are pretty funny though.
Why do we keep challenging Payne, UGA needs to look up the definition of insanity 
Bama first half
What would it matter they aren't playing during the commercial anyway
You would die. 
Georgia isn't allowed to have nice things
They don't stop the clock until under 7 min, unless it's an incomplete pass.
Where are the Bama fans?  Are they Cersie avoiding her trial by combat because they are about to blow up this thread somehow?  
Clip? 
Makes me wonder if GA is running out of ideas..
The kick return
Kick return 
Jennifer Garner
I drafted McCaffrey. I was forced to take Cam after injuries and the fact that he stole all McCaffrey's points.But yeah, I had a terrible draft
At their own 20 during the national championship. Yes you have to punt 
Yeah your going to get murdered. 
As Saints fan who brought out the voodoo in the 4th Q of the SB, I give the dawgs permission to win
I read that as "tug" and now I'll never sleep again 
Punched an UGA player in the face and then attacked an Alabama assistant coach on the sideline.
That wasn't a clothesline that was a perfectly legal tackle he grabbed him by the jersey
I want to let the dread set in, but I'm tired of that shit man. Keep chopping til 00:00 Dawgs. 
Hurts was benched because he sucked
You can watch Sling for free my man 
Horrid. 
I love how the comments are peppered with people 2 plays ahead and others commenting how sick the Kendrick show will be it's so delayed 
Fuck me this is happening isn't it
That or jalen hurts starting record. 
2True2Fresh
Let the Dawgs die. Kill them, if you have to.
  Nearly  Sue
Doesnt matter if it was incidental its against the rules to hit a defenseless receiver in the head 
100%
He gave Hurts enough chances. You are high. 
It''s been suggested that it might and I want to say comparison studies with rugby back that up in theory. 
Well EVERY play only works every now and again 
ROLL TIDE
He is not ugandan he does not kno da wey 
/r/JustFuckMyShitUp 
K i R k H e R b S t R e I t
Uhh...cool people, that's who.
Haha, y'all are completely worthless as fans of the game.
Just the common young interracial couple at a Biker Bar. Nothing out of the ordinary there.
I feel so fucking bad for Nick Chubb.He was like the best back in football before that injury but he''s just got no burst left. I don''t think he''s going to make it at the next level when every defender is faster. 
[deleted]
Does Saban even know that happened? That's something I'd bring up after the game if I were special teams coach. I also would have benched him but that's just me. 
Don't fuck my Nissan!  I just had it cleaned!
Normally I''d want OT but I''m tired af 
“Only ever cared” and your examples are from tonight. I mean I don''t think you''re wrong but your evidence doesn''t real give a lot of support for your claim. 
Nah, please don't.
I had to sit through Bama and Atl blowing it last year. Your turn. 
Clock only stops out of bounds under 2 mins 2nd and 4th quarter
Lies.
Really, really hate this situation
i'm going to smash a salad into my dick if georgia loses this
Kirk and players with their hands on their hips
Ugh. I hate ‘em too.
GEORGIA don't Georgia it up
Lol Georgia deserves to lose with that playcalling. Refs are obviously biased but your OC is not helping right now.
I want Bama to score on the next drive, then a last-second Georgia hail mary 
Been Affleck didn't deserve her\/*tips fedora*
get a stop Dawgs, let's fucking go
Cleveland laughs
Smart could make a diamond right now.
No shit. I''m watching football. Foh 
I feel like that was not a good time for Georgia to run those wildcat plays
Who would win? A coaching staff assembled by Satan himself or one angry boi
Congrats ESPN. Between all the fucking ads and the stuttering, I'm done with this shit. 
By the old gods and the new, I declare a touchdown to happen for the Alabama Crimson Tide this drive.
I think that was a common thought but iirc the numbers on rugby aren't that much better for CTE anyway. Edit: [actually it may be worse](http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/sports/sdut-rugby-head-injuries-safety-2016may16-story.html)
I wish the coaches room was run like survivor.   >Mike Bobo. Please pack your bags and go. 
What I don't want to happen: Bama scores, Georgia drives down and wins with one second left. All year we hear about all year is how they got revenge for the 2012 SEC champ game where they lost the game with 1 second left on the 1 yard line.I would rather lose outright. ( but obviously would rather win outright more than either. )
Jennifer Garner is worse than 48
Okay, so say a team from Georgia blows a lead against the dominant dynasty that everyone has hated for the past decade, would the entire state of Georgia commit mass suicide after another collapse like that?
Wouldn't be a proper championship football game without a team from the state of Georgia blowing a 4th quarter lead!
Jennifer Garner is the Amy Schumer of acting. She is famous and yet no one likes her.
Wild Turkey only works on the better half of the field 
Cut her off
He punched a Georgia player and then took a swing at one of the coaching staff. Please explain how you think he should be playing again, not only in this game but ever again for Alabama.
What are you talking about, UCF are the champs
Then maybe you should have beat Georgia.
a hug a rub and a tug
False
I still can't believe how crisp and clean these commercials on only to turn to the 1980s stylr picture for the game
I'm about to go to bed, I'm losing the plot with all these commercials.
I'm still trying to rectify in my head how that Kentucky running back got ejected but 48 didn't for punching a dude 
Won't matter because you'll wind up paying an arm and a leg with your ISP now if that happens.
Also men
This isn''t close to being that bad.. at worst it''s been a 13 point lead
LIKE!
Stepping out on their own accord versus been forced out.
He tried to punch a coach? Sorry I''ve been watching on my phone with shitty connection 
Mayhem is back has to be the best
Can confirm
Coach that's your water bucket. 
Has potential to get crazy though. 
That 80 yard touchdown pass is looking really important now. 
I would drink Jennifer Garner''s farts
god damn y'all are a whiny bunch tonight.  I get it everyone hates Bama but not everything is a fucking personal foul penalty.
I c u
1st down
when the fuck did we have Paddington 1
Of course they are. Just like the end of the regular season, they teased us with the thought of bit making the playoffs. Now they teased us by looking like they would lose big. Now, not so much.
I'd like to thank the advertisers and networks for making watching football unbearable.
Too soon man. 
GA is a state
REDRUM
So should your fourth quarter play calling...
More stress!
Jennifer Garner
I''d rather do any of that shit than have Direct TV. 
Matt Luke hasn''t said a word during the megacast. He''s probably taking notes on how to be a head coach. 
Wendy's spicy nuggets were the shit, da fuq Wendy's???
I''m on the skycam, anyone wanna clue me in on the Bama player swinging at a coach?
They can't keep getting away with this, can they?!
its a great feeling
I can't wait to see Smith fired up and flying around the field.
he probably knows 
Man, I did not expect Tom Brady to come in the game, let alone make *that* kind of play.
if tua pulls out a win, hurts better declare for the draft because he wont be qb anymore.
They gave him a wooden gun after the last incident
Oh gotcha.  I was confused.  Clearly.
I mean you're from Georgia. You should be ok with it by now. 
I believe it was just "Paddington"
First pitch of a baseball game in July.
Oprah 
How much would you pay for a PPV version of this game with no commercials and just crowd feed during breaks?
Did that pig commercial freak anyone else out. 
Subscribe!
Falcons won didn't you know?
Their other $5 boxes are a way better value. That one is pretty crappy.
Wait wait, there was a Paddington Bear movie.  And now there's a sequel.  wut?
This progressive commercial is mad annoying 
Wtf Georgia, your QB has been tearing it up and you do dumb, predictable Wildcat plays 
It''s too late for Georgie, he''s floating already. 
Are you talking about the woman you have to be living under a rock to not know?
Jennifer Garner capitol one commercials are so stupid
Get tf outta here with this ASMR shit
Not a city
Awful playcalling
Disown.
Many of us have been waiting to see him get more time. No matter what happens, I hope that TT is our starter next year. 
What''s with all the cutesie nonsense? Run your offense ffs
Georgia please light that first half fire again, this is gonna be a painful fucking loss if not. Please just don't lose to bama
ROLL FREAKING TIDE
I wish
Really. Never tried their sandwiches buy shake shacks burgers are meh
With control of the ball, which he didn't have.
True, but OT in the NCG is pretty appealing 
I'm pretty totaled too so I get it  lol. I didn't even start til the halftime show lmao. I'm sorry we took your playoff spot (unless we win, then I'm a little less sorry)
Saban to #48:"I know you tried to physically assault me  ...You're back in. Make a big play or you're off the team & this was an accident."
Throw it deep to Ridley. It's time. 
Meh, a 21-3 lead was just blown this past weekend in the NFL.
I''m going to argue the first point. Why on earth would you ‘do the right thing'' and keep Hurts in the national championship game if you think you have a better shot at winning with the other guy?!?!?As to Brown, yeah that''s fucking ridiculous. Dude should have been ejected.
I'd be ok with that
Pls no I could barely handle one
WELCOME TO MYYYYYY HOUSE
He's probably desperate at this point and wants anyone he can get.
Uh no. Learn how to use logic
fuck this fucking box
Live feed sucks balls. And battery. 
TRUE FRESHMAN DRINK
Georgia aint a city
How is he still in the game after throwing a punch at Georgia player 
>He doesn't care about doing the "right thing".Lol as if this isnt the case for any sports organization except for your son's little league team
No, we can''t 
but you're potato_bus not potatobus
Rugby tends to have fewer concussions on the whole, but it does still happen
Tua is definitely talented. He's made some good throws but I think jalen could make some of the same throws that were made. We have moved the ball a lot better since Tua came in. I'd hate to lose Hurts too. He's got the experience. 
IM`NOT DRENK YO AR
So Georgia teams might choke 2 championships in the past year?
Saban Wild Cat coming up.No way he's taking QB again.
As is tradition, unfortunately not the first time the State of Georgia has felt this feeling.
Think of it this way, the more titles Bama wins the sooner Saban retires
Progressive stop. Now.
something something Falcons suck, UGA says hold my beer.Sigh. 
I HADNT HEARD MAYBE WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT IT MORE
I'm with you on Brown, but benching Hurts is fine...
You don''t. You don''t know what a catch is. 
*should I buy a chinchilla???*
LETS GO TUA. I still say Georgia is being Bama better than Bama is right now.
one of these fanbases has a sinking feeling that's setting in right about now that will end in disappointment and sadness for the entire offseason. that's the one thing I don't envy right now
HOLY MOLY THATS A LOTTA MILES
Heroin?
i wanna bang her so bad man. she is such a dicktease

Four hours is the new normal brah
I'll take it

Is Chris Parnell just a likeable version of Logan Paul?
"He was at Columbia a year ago."It's not uncommon at all for Ivy Leaguers to go outside the conference for grad school and vice versa. We're at a school - it's not like saying "he was on Mars last year and now is playing here."
Where is Dilly Dilly?
We'd be dead!
After the falcons game? absolutely not
You weren''t good at picking a flair
He looks like a moby DICK
"true freshmen"
Quick! Unload the commercials! Gotta make sure this game hits the 4 hour mark!

Really not impressed with Chubb at all from my limited time watching him. I'm a big NFL fan, isn't he supposed to be one of the top backs in the draft this year? Maybe I just haven't watched him enough?
Some people still like cable.. like some people like watching commercials. Others cut the cord. Cut directv.
Progressive commercials make me wanna die
She is attractive and not money
Butthole clench is 7/10. 
They have a good QB yet no throws? No playaction?

Wait I didn''t even process that. Why was Logan Paul on my tv?
Did Burfict swing on a coach in college?
When I punch my coach all I do is get arrested for assault.
I'm shocked they let 48 back in, the fuck are we the bengals?
Fuck you Progressive with your bullshit commercial.
I keep switching back to the coaches room and they are all making less sense as the games goes on. Also, Gundy's eyes are getting progressively more glassy. 
An adorable animated bear who gets into a ton of family friendly mischief.
Bama''s gonna pull this shit out aren''t they
How do you think she feels? She went from starring in popular movies to shilling a credit card. 
Does she do anything other than commercials?
Punched a Georgia player. Albeit the georgia player looked like he really did deserve it. No clue though. 
To be fair he probably didn't see the swing on the coach either. Doubt the coach went and tattled on him. But he shouldve been sent out after the obvious punch on a player.
Momentum''s on the side of the Tide. Wouldn''t be comfortable if I was a Dawgs fan 
TRUE FRESHMAN
I'm mentally prepared to be upset.
Ah yes, the city of Georgia. Wonderful place.
Saban not even gonna sit 48 after he tried to come at him. Get this guy out of the game.
TRUE FRESHMEN!!!!!!!!!!!

43 minutes of commercials so far
shining up their trophy no doubt
she looks way better now than 10 years ago

You geography good.
There have been studies that have shown that is true. Rugby-like play has fewer concussions

Prevent Offense. Worked great for PSU against OSU!
It's solid though. I promise.
A bear. Haven't you been paying attention?
dante hall and devin hester strongly disagree.  also, free throws.

Anyone have a link to 48 swinging on the sidelines? My ESPN stream cut out and I knew I missed something when it came back on.

No, I want Bama to lose. Big difference
It's hard to find LN fam on here. The thread moves so fast lol. 
Holy shit that OC tried to get way too cute. Give it to your studs and stop with the wild cat nonsense. Can''t lose a blocker with Fromm out wide and try to run up the middle 
I hate Progressive ads so much. Every character, every campaign, every tagline. They are so so bad. 
this may be the guinness world record for most fans having deja vu in at once in one stadium ever
Jesus progressive this is embarrassing 
Not sure if it's in the regular broadcast too, but this NBA saturday primetime commercial that starts and ends every god damn commercial break is sincerely starting to get on my nerves.Edit: They literally just played it to start a commercial break, and twice in a row to end the break. Holy fuck.
Shaping up to be a great title game. These guys will be going at it for years to come.

damn, hows the freshman looked?
To be fair, pre-shaken sodas are pretty fucking rad.
Man there is enough time between drives for the coaches to full break down the previous drive and show their team the game tape of the full drive with all the commercials 
Well thank the fucking refs Bama. And playing #48 after punching a player and a coach? Win at all costs eh?
Yeah.
OMG he''s a true freshman? Why am I only hearing about this meow??
Great value at $1 with 3 cheeses. 
He cares about winning. And he does a good job at that. 
Kinda just seems like his style of running doesn''t work against Bama.
How dare you
Jennifer Garner looks like one of those hot chicks that just lays there during sex
Should have been over the moment he tried to punch a coach.
Well, not the *entire* state...

Bama going to do Bama things here aren't they. :'(
Jalen Hurts laughing here like he's totally not going to EMCC here
Absolutely not 
There are definitely too many commercials currently, but if you cut them from the game altogether you're going to see a spike in player injuries. They need those rest breaks in between.
Leave the chinchilla out of this!
No. 48 punched one of our players, went on sideline, hit one of your players, pushed an assistant and has now come back into the game.
I want UCF to enter the stadium with folding chairs like in the WWF
With their QB young, how many players is Georgia losing next year? I see them still being damn good if it's not too many.
I want the type of drama where the clock hits 0 mid play and there is still a legitimate chance for one of the teams to win.
I did not, posted before it loaded on my phone
I really really hate to see that 
Hope you got your affairs in order
We absolutely can not. 
Pls no
PADDINGTON 2 THURSDAY GET HYPE 
I made a vow never to drink bud light. I broke that vow tonight. Don't judge me.

Nah, looks like Jim Bob Cooter playcalling. 
The hate for Bama is flowing tonight, I love it.
I'm having Super BOWL PTSD. My nerves are shot. 
I miss shitting on Butch Jones and Tennessee 
Progressive makes themselves look lame with this commercial. A bunch of 30-40 something year olds trying to appease 16 year old internet culture.
They just put True Freshman on TV, that's gotta be finish your drink worthy right?
Well. He didn't go after saban. 
Understandable. Just know that my obligation is to say Fuck Clemson
The same 9 commercials over and over
lol Progressive with the Vlogger jabs
Anything for a win Sabin.

Sounds like you should.
Sometimes he makes them run!  Now cue "Saban deals appropriately with discipline issues" comments or "how else should he responde" comments.
good idea: take away the threat of a pass so the LBers can just crash downhill.  wildcat is so stupid
More like Raddington
Nah, too many Tech fans from Georgia. I could see all of Louisiana after an LSU collapse. 
You'd be dead
Pushed one of the assistants while trying to assault a coach.
Atlanta sports curse at it again.
Not a fan of abandoning the pass, damn Bama DL making huge stops
That's a dangerous game
on a lot of instagram accounts
These ads are straight out of Idiocracy
Everyone becomes a play calling genius with hindsight. Funny how you guys weren't complaining when Georgia was getting first downs on 3rd and 10+ in the first half.
QUIT MENTIONING DESHAUN WATSON I MIGHT NOT HAVE ENOUGH BEER
Ok defense. Ok. I know, you're tired, you're bloody and beaten and exhausted and you just made a redzone stand, and here we are asking you to make another stop. I know, we're asking a lot you guys, but you have to stop it here! Stop that Tide in their tracks, crush their hopes with those hobnail boots one more time for us boys! Hunker down, hit em hard here, win this game for us you Junkyard Dawgs! 
My ex wife gained 60lb from when I met her. I''ll get you her number. 
nah, that's Gwyneth Paltrow
Different refs.
Thank goodness Tua got rid of that gaudy eye black 
True freshman 
Burgers are definitely meh
He probably jogged back on when it was time for him to go out on kickoff. He may have walked or skipped though as well
If they step out of bounds it should stop until the next snap. If things like a first down happens it stops until they set the ball
Yup. Redeemed himself. He won't see any repercussion for the outburst. 
tRuE fREsHmaN
And he's back in the game...
Lol I showed this to my buddy and he said "We're good, bro. Was it Saban?" and I said, "No." and he said, "then we're good!" and we laughed. haha
I'm pretty sure 48 is imagining that.
Alabama is going to win. God isn't real.
*Back from break. First word is true freshmen lol
Well I bet we get one more solid Bama face mask to glide them into victory, a tale as told as time 
Pac-12 Power. 
NCAA 2005 Update: Arkansas got a good drive going through the quarter break and got into the red zone but my Gators defense forced and recovered a huge fumble to put the offense back on the field and to keep Arkansas off the board. 4:36 to go in the 1st half, 8-0 Gators the score
How was that not an interception?? He caught it IN BOUNDS. He just didn't catch it good enough for the refs? Alabama looking like the Pats with the calls this game
It depends on whether it's within 2 minutes of the half. Within 2 minutes, the clock stops until the next play. Otherwise, just until they set the ball.
And it''s been boring as hell.
Bama is going to fucking run shop now
No
In college I think inside 2 minutes clock stops until next snap. Otherwise clock stops until refs set the ball. 
I want you to record yourself do that, and put a picture of NBC and ABC's logo
I really don't understand why people are surprised that 48 came back in the game, Saban has always put winning above anything else. 
oh my god TACKLE A MOTHERFUCKER
Not sure if I'd really rather listen to Herbstreit ramble during game breaks 
Not even remotely as unlikeable. 
[Here](https://twitter.com/gifdsports/status/950577922007556097)
I think r/cfb retweeted it
Don''t talk shit on asmr 
Freshman
MORE FUCKING COMMERCIALS
With the dirty play by 48, the incorrect penalty on the blocked punt, and the missed facemask, a Bama win would really be a sight to see. This whole sub would be massively pissed off, not just the UGA fans.
Jalen Hurts would make an awesome pirate
Between directv and progressive, I'd kill myself if I worked in advertising 
FUCKING TACKLEThey weren't missing shit the 1st half, now it's horrible
wtf harris aint fair nerf pls
Funny enough mine actually is 100% legal through my work and I'm also about a minute behind. It's killing me.
They''re allowed to blatantly hold every single play. And not just the incidental technically holding by a strict reading of the rules, but blatant holding that a less profitable team for ESPN would be penalized for
Gotta make that open field tackle... 
Tackle much?
Dudes gotta tackle
The real LPT is always in the comments 
1st down and they have to reset the chains? Not sure if thats what youre talkin about though..
What about the 33 points?
I like having a liver 
T R U E F R E S H M A NRUEFRESHMAN
Why does Hurts have a helmet on his head? He should be filling out his FAU transfer paperwork right now.

We can't tackle
Yeah, getting cute when they need to just play.
So my sarcasm was missed there eh?
Looks like our defense went home already
Tackling has been forgotten. 
Jesus, make a fucking tackle
wHaTs A cOmPuTeR
A salt with a deadly peppa 
Alabama acting like the refs haven't kept this close for them. 
Oh no Georgia is fucked
The Progressive Box is trying to take Logan Paul's vlogging viewer base I see.
Not the whole state.
Ah yes, the limp fish^^^tm
Did Harris ever "spin" during that run?
both defenses starting to look gassed. we might have a little shootout to end this game. oh boy
Fucking terrible tackling 
When the runner goes out of bounds with forward progress, the clock stops. When it stops and starts again, that's usually because the runner was stopped and pushed out of bounds by a defender, but they were across the first down chain. The stoppage is a short stoppage to reset the chains for a new set of downs. After the chains are reset, the clock restarts.

South Texas, most people here are just glad Oklahoma lost lol
I've always seen the real saban believe me. Spoiled coach at the head of a fanbase of spoiled children. 
lol what''s open field tackling?
oh lawd Bama got sum mentum
Scored on his first drive and now is doing good
I'm shit at formatting on mobile/kinda drunk but here's a hilarious UGA trainer who just realized this isn't a speakeasy. https://i.imgur.com/9xkatR6.png
True freshman!!!!
It just means more
Georgia tackling has been just horrendous 
HUNKER DOWN DAWGS
Don't forget mentioning the phrase "True freshman"
He normally is. But Alabama has clearly prepped for any and all of his plays. So it's just not working.
What is the name of the song that plays for the college basketball promo?
Georgia tackling has been atrocious
I am sorry.  She has turned to the dark side.  Your mother hates fun.
Most likely scenario
If I hear freshman. One. More. Time.
Bamas gonna win this, aren't they
Been sayin it all year. Harris >> Scarborough
Those were some big whiffs. Wow.
The first three people who try to tackle never can bring him down
UNLIMITED HOLDING
So?
Georgia's defense has forgotten how to tackle.
A true freshman is guaranteed to win the Championship title and that's just so weird. 
You have to tackle them
I dont know if you went to the bathroom on a canvas after Taco Bell it''d look like a Jackson Pollack.
That''s why Duke spanks some top ACC team every year
Anyone else legitimately shocked that the guy who punched a Georgia player and went after a coach on the sidelines is still in the game?
If you or a loved one has been diagnosed with Mesothelioma you may to be entitled to financial compensation.
UGA tackling is shitting the bed at the moment 
Because we''re Kentucky. We find a way. 
The Talking Progressive Box is cancer
If I here the word true freshmen again , I'm going to kill myself.
Yes Daboll Yes
What is a tackle anyway
[deleted]
Bama has hard backs to tackle. Lemme keep hitting them in the shoulders.
Jalen looks like he's considering where he'd like to transfer to
Why is this lowkey a great game 
(Deletes post)
It's over.  The choke job is on.
Alabama is kinda holding and getting away with it. Center keeps holding for Bama.
UCF will always be champion in my heart. :c
What happened to hurts?
As a Chiefs fan, I gotta say, this looks vaguely familiar
Do they not teach tackling at Georgia?
This game is giving me anxiety
AN OPEN FIELD NED
You mean against OU, who has one of the shittiest defenses in the game? Yeah, I do remember
He had that receiver open deep
Everyone gonna just forget about the 3 HUGE missed calls on bama aren't they...
I don''t have a link, but I know my ESPN app gave me a notification about it so I''m sure you could find one on it if you have it
He's a really good coach too
*insert witty reply here
You court death. 
gotcha!
the excuse is that this is the biggest game of the year and 48 is a good special teams player as shown on that recent kick 
flair bud!
I never understand why commentators literally say this about every QB who ever gets benchedStanding/sitting quietly on the sidelines doesn''t necessarily mean you are handling being benched well
I swear to god, if Bama pulls this out I'll...Well, I'll eat something nice before I go to bed and be happy I could just be a casual observer that just wanted to see a good game. 
So many different fakes in that one play.
good run stop
Next time notice the salad falls through the glass door
can not believe how many missed tackles there are on both sides in this game
Man, UGA's tackling has been shit tonight. 
He didn't spin at all though
Literally a graphic on the TV that says "true freshman" lmao
y u do dis bama
If Saban has any sense, he'll leave Brown back in Georgia with a bus ticket to Columbus.
UGA forgot how to tackle after halftime. 
Speed this game up. I gotta work in the morning! 
some really poor tackling from Georgia
Nope
I think this means that God is real. 
Such bad tackle, jesus christ...
That cashew guys looks like the mob boss in John Wick.
Anyone else really hate the NBA Primetime commercial I've seen a gazillion times now?
The guy who walks into the glass door drops his salad outside the door.
Georgia missing tackles. May be getting tired
Could coke fix a race riot?  No. I thought not. 
Bama's tying it up here
Oh thank god 
Really? I feel like she'd be fun.
TRUE FRESHMAN TRUE FRESHMAN TRUE FRESHMAN TRUE FRESHMAN TRUE FRESHMAN TRUE FRESHMAN TRUE FRESHMAN
Hurts can probably take his helmet off now
Nope it''s saban 
Me too thanks 
Yall act like saban is micro managing player groups mid game. That is on special teams coach.
let's go D
I had no  idea that these were true freshman! 
Someone painted the Georgia D's gloves with Crisco.  TACKLE, DAMMIT!
Tackling
No! Hold the line! Go Dawgs! 
I can never remember how far Cookout has sprawled. I take it not to WV yet?
This is like watching a Wisconsin Rose Bowl game. You just know it's not going to end well. 
Don''t let this game let you forget that the bird team lost a lead to the patriotic team that one time 
Wonder what's going on through Hurt's head
Harris reminds me of OJ Simpson
Fowler is seeing things again. He didn't spin. 
interception incoming don't say I didn't tell ya
**YOU MUST BELIEVE**
No it shouldn't have been. It's a horse collar if he grabs the back of the jersey and yanks. Although it looked dirty, they reviewed it and correctly decided it was just a rough arm tackle since he grabbed the front of the jersey. Check the rules if you want. And Its hard to say if he should or shouldn't go back in when we don't know what that stuff on the sideline was all about.
Oh...he grab the jersey after reaching all the way across the retuners neck...yeah not a clothesline cause he got a piece of jersey like the non facemask
Oh no, they gonna Georgia it
"The intent is to provide players with a sense of pride and accomplishment" - Saban on why he let 48 stay in the game
Wish I liked bama enough to yell roll tide at the bar 
Really hope Bama can pull this off. It would be the saltiest timeline.
Georgia realizes they need to tackle right?
I want a chinchilla
For the love of Fuck TACKLE
Gotta go visit Buddy for a year at EMCC for a year first. 
\> be UGA\> get to NCG\> get big lead\> forget what tackling is
Can't believe Hurts hasn't gotten another drive.
I am pretty disgusted.
I'm actually afraid for Georgia now
Dilly dilly!
Georgia just isn't making their tackles. Bama will walk this game into the endzone if they don't start.
What is "tackle"?
That's true, really only have a problem with the offsides call on he blocked punt... but I called it offsides live so shrug
look upward,  about 3 comments
The composure of Tua vs. Hurts is night and day
It just means more.
All of Reddit yes
Nope, just because it is a Bama player.
Okay then. Game's about to turn :|
It''s ok bb I''m here 4 u
For sure. Looking back on it, 2 of their losses were to CFP teams, and Kentucky and A&M were mostly due to Roper''s awful offensive playcalling. I definitely like what Muschamp is doing, and I can see the Palmetto Bowl having huge national implications soonI always love being able to have good football conversations with Clemson fans, without the belittling of our blooming onion!
;)
I'm sad that college football is ending, but I'm stoked that I won't have to sit through any shit commercials for the next few months.
Georgia is helpless right now 
What year is this Bama QB? 
Hate Bama all you want but....Excellent halftime adjustment by Saban. 
Damien Harris how I loathe thee
Come on BamaBury them
Future Michigan Wolverine.
Classless as fuck
It's actually been a pretty damn interesting game if you've been watching.
Hurts is one mature bastard
Georgia got any other true freshman you can play? That seems to be the way to go tonight
And clotheslined a player for his next appearance
At least it didn''t involve filming a corpse.
more or less. I'd say scouting is also an issue, Fromm is playing well enough to give Georgia the lead and he's also a true freshman
false start on the offense, buddy. You can't call false start on the defense. Replay showed several offensive players jumped before the snap.
Let's take this moment to remember the Auburn Tigers.
I am. It's an incredibly classless move.
Thread's have been like that all night.  It's fun to figure out how far ahead in time I've traveled.
Fucking preach.
OT pls
Youtube tv has a 7 day free trial
FRESHMAN
Alabama''s leading passer, rusher, and receiver are all freshmen. Fromm is also a freshmen. Tennessee and Auburn have a rough few years ahead
Tua just seems to bring a different look to the offense, and his ability to throw a ball like an actual QB is a breath of life for the offense. 
Drinking game: Take a shot any time you hear "true freshman"

Trenton Thompson is gonna be a very good player 
CAN SOMEONE COVER THE FLATS
Those were effective because the pass was expected imo. The run is predictable out of the wildcat
:(
Yeah that's true, but they still fucked it up.
I'm gonna turn this off and go to bed now and pretend Bama isn't going to score here and win. I've seen this story way too many times - the bad guys win and whoever I like brings me misery.
Hey, Georgia, giving the receivers a 15 yard cushion isn't a great tactic.Trust me, I know this.
Nope, because Saban
He could be Captain Jack Sparrow in a live action Pirates of the Caribbean
Saban just sacrificed that poor freshman DB and created his 15th giant dreaded black running back to replace Scarborough 
What I'm most disappointed in is the fact that I have to wake up in the morning and go to work five times a week now.
CHOKING INTENSIFIES
78 would make me shit my pants
noooooOOOOO!!
So, who else is rooting for the Titans to beat the Patriots this weekend?
Georgia needs to have better tackling than this tired arm tackling bullshit. 
Hard lag
I would pay an extra $10 a month for my Netflix for that specific feature. And if you could have a few games showing at once.
Putting this thread on Live has literally bricked my reddit app and my entire phone.
Live by the memes, die by the memes 
I can''t believe you''ve done this.
Bama has like 12 runningbacks
UGA D forgot how to tackle
Please no overtime. I have to catch a train. 
Come on Georgia keep up the defense.
Shouldn''t you hate Georgia more?
but how will i get my chicken tendies
I thought I was watching the national championship not a replay of the super bowl
Lol You can see how shitty hurts feels on his face
Uh-oh Georgia is gunna have a bad night again I think 
Man, is Tua really short or is Bama just full of crazy tall guys?
Georgia looks like they've never tackled before
Is his current background him playing?
I'm waiting for him to come in at QB. 
After all the dirty shit I've seen Bama do this game, no, not at all
Georgia, please.
rekt
Idk if you've noticed but we are Idiocracy now. 
"Jalen Hurts missing. Last seen at Chik-Fil-A."
If someone redoes this with all the emojis in it I''ll give them some gold 
Never actually seen Saban rip someone's spine out and beat them to death. Now we can see what really goes on at half time.
Bama is about to win aren't they?
Brb putting on my lucky Ohio state shirt to see if I can channel voodoo to Georgia
let's go D!
Damn Georgia tackling like we use to under Strong
28-3 flashing right before their eyes
This is just Roquan Smith vs Alabama's offense.
That progressive commercial was aids. Come on, Chris Purnell. You''re better than that. 
Truth be told. This game has been exciting as fuck.
Grab and tackle. GRAB AND TACKLE!
Someone stop it, please.
Saban likes winning more than being ethical
It sounds like the commentators are saying "Tyler Logan went in at QB for Alabama."
Looked like he had a guy over the top running a flag route. Could have been a touchdown.
Welcome to every season 
Southpaw Marino Vick
We shall go down with the ship 
fr the media hyped up his lockscreen too much for this
It is going to get worse before it gets better
HEY THERE CARDINAL FRIEND
Not too happy with the Dawgs changeup in play calling. 
I''m sleeping on the couch tonight. I''m married with a kid. Yup. 
Georgia's has absolute piss poor tackling. 
I just realized the Bama QB is a lefty, not too many southpaw QB's these days
Man, I thought I was the only one
The fringe chip. A freethrow in the 1st quarter. The intentional walk. Unintentional walks. Bunts with no one on. The PAT. 
#T R U E F R E S H M A N
I feel so bad for him.
freshman.. spank me
"Glad they can't blame me if this goes to shit."
First down clock stoppage is stupid as hell.
Yes.
I know the pass was incomplete but that was a nice move to get away from the pass rush
Thank you for being a sane Alabama fan.
Ugh that sack would've been nice 
Georgia forgot how to tackle GG.
Georgia playing like their being coached by Andy Reid. 
I''m Hurts and I have cableAnd I''m Tua and I have DirectTV
Less risky pass more run
This made me laugh out loud 
Everybody.
Keep that pressure up on newbie. 
This is a big 3rd down
Wrap them up Dawgs! Come on, you're tired I know but wrap them up, hang on and gang tackle these shifty backs!
Blitz!
Winning means more than class....Just ask UNC. ):
Georgia tackling makes 15 yards look easy 
The fact that he's still in the game just shows that he's not going to be punished at all.
Yep
We tried to warn them.
I miss having lefty QBs in my life, this is good.
I swear I heard a whistle right after the snap
On Tagovailoa, I haven't heard it mention, so I thought I would address the elephant in the room. He seems like a smart kid, so I'm wandering how his transition to the states has been as far as communication goes? Are we doing anything different like special playbooks or relying on signals more when he's in the game? I thought I saw him point to receivers a couple of times and defenses might catch on if he's pointing to who he's going to throw the ball to. The only time I've been out of the country is when I was shipped to Nam and I was as confused as a yankee learning to square dance.
I mean it's 'bama..
>Do a barrel roll!
Braves
I predict the rookie QB will make a mistake.
Do a touchdown tua
dragging bulldogs along
Seriously no. It's the natty, not surprised.
JAWJUH PLOZ!!!!
As someone completely uninvested in this game, lets take it to OT please.
Lots of feeble arm-tackle attempts by Georgia in space lately.
So with a left handed qb do you put your number one receiver on the left side instead of the right 
3rd
UGA's inability to wrap up makes me concerned that they also ignored that lesson in sex ed.
No. Because bama
NFL needs live bands like this
this harris kid is a cheat code
Dawgs gotta hold here
He looks calm on the outside, but he Hurts on the inside
bullshit. that is not an excuse, that is some shit they should be fined for. He should have been kicked out of the game from the beginning. "Best player" should not get special treatment.
No. It''s the championship game. Sit his ass into 2019 if you want. But he plays tonight. 
If it''s same guy then yes 
!remindme
Georgia defense is getting softer than Auntie Anne''s pretzels
We need a few OTs tbh
...And, he''s playing. 
The Falcons...err sorry the Bulldogs are gonna Georgia this so hard.
Stop blaming the extra game. Georgia had a 13-point lead. It's their game to lose.
Man. It's a great little fast food restaurant. It's worth googling just for the menu tbh. Ha 
Someone should post the It's Happening gif
I seriously and truly hate Alabama. Please don't choke Dawgs
Did you guys know that 2 true freshman are playing right now????
What a punk
Okay so what if your boss let something like that slide?
Georgia choking this away
Is that a hard stare?!
I don''t particularly like them but I''m going to try and be objective the whole game
I''ll get the pastys, you get the brewskies, meet ya at da deer camp in 20
BUTT CLENCHING INTENSIFIES 
Yes. That ignorant fuck should be in street clothes in a hotel room. 
Oof
I just want 6 overtimes so I don't have to go home lol
Let's be real, we're only here for the same four commercials all night anyway
Does anyone know if any true freshman are in the game?
Georgia is going to blow this and piss off 99% of the nation 
this is truly the darkest timeline
Missed: thrown punch, head shove, clothesline
Big down here 
Joe buck: they way I see it this is a big third down 
I was rooting for you until you mentioned a certain boot.
It's Monday
Jesus fuck UGA, tackle.
Fuck Georgia, I cant handle this shit two weeks in a row
Come on Georgia just hold on for 6 more minutes, maybe add some more points.  
Damn...too soon    Edit: Jalen Hurts to A&M confirmed 
That's probably why he felt comfortable swinging at the coach. He is good and Saban wants to win.
gg georgia 
Alabama is going to convert 
Thaaaat's a flag
4th down territory? 
I can.
Yes
Most biker bars are fairly open and progressive despite their image in pop culture.  One of my fondest memories is getting drunk and getting a whole trucker/biker dive singing "Sweet Transvestite" from Rocky Horror on karoake night after I picked it as a punishment for a pool loss to a gay buddy of mine.
Reddit would replace Morton as America's salt company
Georgia's pass rush is pathetic. They've got a true freshman back there and they can't get any pressure on him.
Alabama are just going to find a way to fight until the end. No matter what. They just win games.
Shit play calling.
It's him losing last year 
He lost his face crosses? Did the dark lord ban non pagan imagery?
Wait, I am only getting to catch the last quarter of this game... why is Jalen Hurts not playing?
Georgia please don''t be that team
The Georgia defense needs to step up and make an open field tackle.
Obvious PI is Obvious.
Damien Harris will be a nice pick later in the draft next year
NOOOO WTF
Was gonna say, that is one of the worst commercials I''ve seen yet. Definition of a commercial making me not buy their product. 
>beaver You rang???
It's such a stupid commercial
No Olympics for you?
Parrish is no bueno
*Prices of diamond futures plummet* as new mine found in Georgia and Alabama fans asses. Butt cheeks clenched tight.
FUCK YES BABY
please make a stop
Nick Chubb the False Senor will end the game.
Drunk think am I'm not as you I
I need to sleep man. 
Fuck.

Wow
HOW DU BAMA GET FERST
**T**R**U**E**F**R**E**S**H**M**A**N
Big if true freshman
I think they're trolling us.
Saban has gotten 13 points from Tua. 
THE DAWG PUSHED HIM
Uncatchable
Ok this qb littalry has a rocket launcher for a arm
Flop
Oh come on!
No OT please.  It''s getting late.  We need Paul George out here.  
Oh, so here's the flag. 
Bama's gonna win this game, aren't they?
I get the same feeling when I see Kristen bell and pretty much any of those abc weeknight drama stars
Ref threw that flag harder than the QB threw the ball
Called it lol 
Whoever coaches Georgia on tacking should be ashamed. 
TACKLE!!!!
Saban sacrificed him to create another power running back 
hey bb
You burn in hell.
Hahahha funny
ok, but it still doesn't benefit Bama unfairly.
WOW WHAT A BS FLAG
Harden would be proud.
Absolute bullshit.
Just like I wish I could yell O H... right?
Freshman, drink
BULLSHIT FLAG
gosh we need this conversion
Don't you put that on us
Tackling has been forgotten, but grabbing jerseys has not
Tua aint no Mariota
There you go, put some pressure on that freshman, make him crack! Hunker Down boys!
Uhh..... uncatchable?
I hate seeing injuries because I've been there. If he got his femur shattered, I wouldn't be sad.
Ball was not catchable.  
How is that interference
Bama having a rest advantage because they're the lower seed and didn't play a conference championship is so dumb
HE WASNT GOING TO CATCH IT ANYWAY!!! SO DUMB
Bama's going to at least tie this.
More true freshman, last year true freshman.  
Smart you are overthinking this why are you running the damn wildcat 
Bullshit
I really enjoyed the commentary because at least it''s not the normal shitty commentary. But I had to switch back because of the lack of good game angles. Way too much dead space on the screen. 
Made a great play on kickoff 30 minutes later I thought he was done too 
OH NOW YOU CALL A FUCKING FLAG!?!
HE FUCKING FELL DOWN WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT??? 
Did Waffle House sponsor that flop? 
Watch people lose it over that perfectly legitimate PI
big flag there!
I mean I''m not really doing it, because you really would be dead 
Tua has some nice zip on his passes
What a weak call.
That's an awful call
Nah, you didn't take our playoff spot. If we had beat OSU, then yeah, but we lost. If anything you took UCF's playoff spot lol
Lol of course thats a flag after Bama gets away with some blatant shit.
Why does the Command Center have a Hurts feed?
TERRIBLE
Obvious PI. Clear call
Everyone trying to convince themselves this is a good game. At least ESPN is making that sweet sweet commercial money
WEAK ASS FUCKING CALL
I liked it better when Hurts was playing
lol looked like a trip
ok, Carter came away from that play with a larger jersey than he started it, and that ball landed 5 feet outta bounds 
Nah, they're actually running the ball 
I really am so sick of Alabama. Hate them so much 
Come on......
Refs bailing out bama again
Lol at the DB throwing his hands up like that wasn't an obvious PI
Georgia needs to follow that catchphrase from Heroes: "Save the Girl, Save the World"
Where's the motherfucker who said a third down flag would extend this drive? I have some words for them.
Knew he got beat. 
No idea... I think sophomore? Maybe senior? Hmm. Maybe they will tell us again.
HE TRIPPED!
BULL. FUCKING. SHIT
Wow...
oh now they call PI
"there is no diving in football"
ANOTHER FRESHMAN
And another flag on us
Hahahahahaha wow
yeah i should prolly give it another shot, but i really dont wanna have to get over that shit again. 
Arguably uncatchable
Bullshit call
When Bama needs the call they gonna get it. Who you kidding???
That seemed mutual...
that's a trip up no wayyy
Pass interference !!!
That was light 
Tangled up?
Clearly Pi, pushed him.
Bama was gifted 4 no calls
I want to die
Really gonna commit PI there? Bad time for that mistake
how is that a flag if the ball is un catchable?
Whoever made that prediction was right. Good job. 
Eh.  Kinda weak call.
Sold that
Hold. Bullshit refs 
Taking their ques from the Falcons.
He should have just punched the guy
Weak call
Saw that flag from a mile away
Goddammit you can''t fucking do that for fucks sake
Yeahhh you can't do that
Oh so now they finally call PI. What the fuck refs.
i dont think there was anything there
UGA: its not like you needed to give them more reason to throw flags.
Good call.
The hottest she's ever looked is in these commercials. Stunning. 
I'm rooting for y'all, don't worry. But I'm rooting for a good game more. And it has been that.
Holy shit the refs are gonna win the national championship
QB may not be able to hit him with a pass but ref can hit him with a flag.
lmao bull shit
Whoever called Bama getting stopped and the drive getting extended step right up
DeVonta Smith, another freshman
Illegal hands to the face on the offensive line no? Okay
Stupid play and the ball wasn't catchable.
Please Dawgs one time 
And another hold that was ignored. 
^^Dun dun ^^Dun dun duuuuuuuuuuuuunChrist, learn a new song please!
But is he a true freshman?
That's a weak PI.
Georgia looking like they're being coached by... well... any coach who realizes they have a late lead against Bama. This shit always happens. 
Where
fuck fuck fuck
The big sell
Weak af
He hit a coach, but yeah, I lost a lot of respect for Saban. 
Starting QB got benched in the championship and a player hit a coach.If it was anyone else but Hurts, I'd guess it was the QB
*Falcons PTSD flashbacks*
Diiiiiive
You think the commercials are bad? This whole damn game is one big DirecTV ad. 1st half Georgia has it, 2nd doesn't.
This game would be over if not for the zebras.
[Dear Georgia](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXOBW8SMAJ8)
heyyyyyyy.you right :/
ASMR is shit.
HEY THERE FELLOW CARDINAL FRIEND. IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU HERE SINCE THERE ARE VERY FEW STANFORD FANS.
Flop
The fix is in for real
Fucking WEAK
That's a weak ass call, zebra.
You pushed him dude, c'mon 
Looks like a self-trip to me.
thats a soft call 
That kid is elusive as hell.....for a TRUE FRESHMAN
Me too. After Kellen Moore was cut there are no lefty qbs in nfl which makes me sad. Hopefully this kid pans out 
Fuck
Looks like a weak call
James Harden plays WR for Bama
That's a pathetic call, honestly. Little contact from both, nothing worth a flag.
kill me
what a dive 
I've always wanted to be a 1%er. 
not like this, Georgia..
Ok herbie, we get it. They''re freshman. 
Lol fuck this bullshit fuck bama fuck these refs
That ref hit the Bama player with his flag. Must be another 5* True-Freshman 
That was legit but a little ticky tacky in my opinion.0
That was weak... 
Thats right, only Ga fouls
Are we giving this game away?
Bulllshit
Refs got that bag on Bama, again. 
Fuck bama
Is awesome.  Great perspective from the whole crew all game.  Amin is pretty decent too.
Everyone is. We are all UGA tonight
How is that ball catchable. Fuck off refs. Were getting hosed 
That''s the game
Bailout call
Mmmmmmmmmmm that penalty was ticky-tacky
What happened to letting them play?
Probably when he grabbed him then shoved him down 
He''s going to be beast mode
What? No way!
A true freshman, you say?
https://media.giphy.com/media/l1ugg6a28yjAxZxp6/giphy.gif
He reached across his chest and grabbed the jersey. Nothing wrong with that hit at all
Flopping in football! Great
goddamn don't fucking blow it
Thaaaaat's a very friendly call. Bama DBs have been far more touchy than that all game. 
That was meh. 
Man that dude just fell smh
That wasn''t remotely catchable
good acting
A bit of a shove, a bit of a dive
I love the outrage for getting a flag when he literally pushed the receiver down. 
Georgia sports are destined to become memes 
Bummer the announcers haven't talked about that at all.
Trash call.
fuck
He totally tripped...
Dumbass--if he'd just played he'd have been fine.
I knew this felt familiar. 
He tripped?
That is a terrible fucking call, they are fighting for the ball.
There you go refs. Reestablish your ~~bias~~ dominance. 
Clemson, Ou, and Georgia did play extra games. Advantage Alabama
Looking like Russell Wilson there
brutal
Pressure isn't the problem, Tua is just slippery as hell. 
FLOP
I'm shocked
Flopped for that penalty.
Is he really gonna compain he didnt interfere? Lmao
not sure if that was catchable but he pushed to  much to not call
Rly
Refs will give bama the game
He fell..
Dude did nothing for the first 2 quarters. So, Saban benched him. 
Can I ask why Georgia keeps getting all these pass interference calls and Alabama doesn't get any?
How is that pass interference? The Alabama receiver made contact there and fell? All on him. 
They made the call because he fell...
ffs....
That's so ticky tacky
what a dive
a little ticky tack to me.
Unnecessary PI. Uncatchable ball.
Meh. Weak flag 
Does anyone know if that counts as a 3rd down conversion?
Hand on the collar, no eye on the ball.  Called 85% of the time.
Nice flop lol I'll take it
Not catchable and incidental.
He sucked in the first half
Georgia has been getting thoroughly fucked by the refs all night.
Oh, so now an official can see a penalty happen
Ohhh so now refs wanna call penalties. Fuck this bullshit. Bama is getting gifted the game
Flag to extend the drive.  Credit to the person who called that 
Lmao Bama DBs pushing like that all game with no flags
flop
Is Alabamas line this bad or UGA d this good ?
Can''t call that shit now if they haven''t thrown it the whole game.
"Jalen Hurts has shows a lot of maturity..."Yes, and how much maturity is ESPN showing by dedicating a Command Center camera to the benched QB?
Yeah fuck this 
Day 1 starter in Piscataway 
They''re losing a lot next year actually. It''s about the only bad factor facing UGA''s program right now. But with their recruiting and coaching I don''t think there will be much of a drop off.
Maybe, but with 6 minutes left it's risky.
F L O P
Don't let the Falcons blowing a 28-3 lead distract you from the fact that Georgia once lead 20-7. 
that was equal contact
Baaarely.
T U F E H A R E R S A
Lol I [LITERALLY](https://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/7p4jhr/game_thread_cfp_ncg_georgia_vs_alabama_8pm_et/dsei36m/?context=0) called it. That's such a weak flag.
That looked like PI in real time but in replay that's pretty bad call
Flopping like it''s the other football
both had their hands on each other and the ball wasn't even catchable 
WE BACK TO FUCKING THE REFS. Freshman circlejerk had ended
Yeah fucking right, he fucking tripped up on his own accord.
If Jalen wants to get back in this game I think he has to punch someone in the face. That's the kind of moxie Saban is looking for apparently
Georgia still standing 5 yards away from the sidelines.
Weaaaaaaak
soft call
of coursecontact yes, but the hold was the WR grabbing him to sell it haha
lol this is actually happening, isn't it
Weak.
Can't wait to see the Jalen Hurts transfer watch be going all off season 
That ball was in bounds.
College football is fun and at the end Bama always fucking wins
Hand fighting and the receiver fell
Who knew the officials had flags?
The fucking hell!!!
Mmmmm bullshit
Bullshit 
We need a turnover
Bailed out of course. Fuck sake 
LMAO Bama gets another call. Fucking shocker. 
The bright side to this game being on ESPN as opposed to ABC is that we don't have to watch an ad for whatever new forced "progressive" show they're pimping ad naseum during every commercial break.
They are called running backs for a reason. Fuck the QB runs.
I guess Sparty would know 
He was ineffective and benched. 
Complete rigging. The receiver held the DB. 
WeakThat hand fighting goes on all the timedidnt cause him to fall down
Man come on Georgia :(. We''re all counting on you, let''s Goooooo
FUCK NO... NO NO NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO 
Yoda?
Because having a guy like that on the sideline is bad for the rest of the team. This shouldn't even be a discussion. He needs to hit the showers
Yep, it's one of those games.
Looking at Jalen hurts
That's PI but the way calls have been missed vs UGA, dawgs are right to be pissed. Not knowing anything else about this game that's not a bad call.
That was such a flop
JUUUDDDDYYYYYY
That's literally the first time I've ever seen *that* misspelling.
What a sad way to lose
i'm being entertained
Kinda looked like he knew he wasn''t gonna get it and flopped
What a tic tack call to make in this situation 
Knew that was gonna happen
Where's Hurts? If he's injured, is there a replay of the injury?
Team stripes is looking pretty good out there.
Bullshit. He tripped
Replaced with OUs D at half
The dude is already back playing. There's no way word hasn't made it back to Saban that his player swung on his assistant. Wow, that's pretty shitty. 
If I'm UCF I am really pissed at watching this game at home.#GoBadgers
Bullshit. Call that but not the FUCKTONS of holds
what a bullshit call
What a flop
We're gonna blow the lead aren't we... Dammit Georgia
$ BAMA $
Them tides is hell
You didn't hear? Georgia is a soccer state now. 
Added it to OP
Incidental contact not as bad as pushing a dudes head into the ground long after the whistle.....#K.
Here we go........
WHERE IS THE FULL REPLAY
Holding holy shite
That was actually smart by tua
It's our last 5 minutes of regulation football for the season... savor it bois and girs.
Fucking hell Georgia 
Aaaand we''re fucking ourselves with a stupid penalty. Georgia will always be Georgia...
He got it
Fifa did.
Why do these refs hate Georgia?
Thats the weakest shit ive ever seen
#FRESHMAN BOWL
GA''s defense looks tired. 
omg Georgia please blow this
Can't relate, we always start behind 
Replaced at halftime for not throwing well 
Hmm the refs must have misplaced their Crimson jerseys 
James fucking harden shit
Terrible call. Refs are giving Bama every chance they can
It just never that fun to play Bama.  They keep coming. 
Nice grab
You spelled honor the British way ya damn red coat
??? That was the right call 
Feeders
You're gonna call THAT?? Fuck this game. I'm done. 
Calls PI but not holding ??... k
Literally the only reason I have it is so I can watch my favorite nfl team out of market
Go to progressive.com to view the uncensored version they wouldn't let us air on TV!^/s
If im not mistaken both Fromm and Tua are elite 11 QB's from the same class am i right?
I just pushed him. He's the one who fell. How is that a flag? 
Tua needs to lower his passes...
They say freshman a lot
that hit wasnt dirty to anybody that played football past sophomore year of high school. calm down your rage and watch georgia choke, you crazy person
When are you going to call the fucking holding 
That was a basketball level flop there. 
Bama guy sold the hell out of that PI 
This is like watching your grandma, your uncle, and your dog die all on the same night. 
That's a decent call. But flags going bamas way all night
Any QB can look great with 6 seconds to throw. 
damn juedy got hops
So glad I'm not the only one thinking that
Ticky-Tack call there 
FRESHMAN ON FRESHMAN ACTION
Man Fuck Bama
That's a bit soft but you can't lay hands on him and not expect the flag once the WR falls
Does Saban go for two if they get the TD?
Wow... nice catch 
That's a good call.
Fuck me
Bullshit dude, #6 sold the fuck out of that
God...that PI was BS
What a catch
Because everybody Hurts...sometimes
Freshman circle jerk 
WHAT TF OFHUASHDUILBDSHDJASLJK
Dislike that call... how bout you call a offensive holding for once 
These refs SUCK 
Damn, this kid's got a canon 
These refs are ass man
Incidental contact, he knew he couldn't get the ball, and flopped.
Seriously. good god
Ball didn''t seem catchable at all
Feeders
fre s h  m a  a  nnnnn
I can't believe that call...
#The LEFTY
My friend''s girlfriend is a student at Bama and is currently at the game. Her name? Georgia
Would be ironic if it was on an underthrow.
Hmm...2017 Superbowl: team from Georgia blows a lead against the premier team in the league2018 CFB Natty: team from Georgia blows a lead against the premier team in the league
That''s called a flop...
I swear to Christ these refs have money on the Tide. 
FRESHMAN TO FRESHMAN
Wow. Bullshit flag
h*ck
Nice flop
thats a flop
What more can the refs do to ensure a Bama victory?
Refs are handing Alabama this game.Holy shit.
Well Georgia is giving up on defense this might be the end if Bama scores. Fuck me for telling Bama to put Tua in lol
Blitz the goddamn freshman Kirby!
Bama bailed out by refball again. Sick competitive balance.
no pass rush, can't tackle.  GA looks gassed
3 down and flag...
I'm dragging up every bit of motivation I can muster here haha
UNLIMITED HOLDING. NO RULES fucm you alabama
Meteor is running a tad late. Need OT. 
If this game goes to OT, UCF Are the national champions
God damn it defense. You're getting soft.
Welcome back refs. Nice to see you still fucking with everybody. 
F R E S H M A N R ESHMAN
Soft call
**Freshman to Freshman**
I think he tripped... because he was pushed
Oh god its happening
Great catch
Hang on, I just texted the announcers, I got the inside line. Just wait a minute, they'll answer your question. Just watch. 
Do you guys really think that wasn''t interference?
Idk who called it, but sure enough bama got stopped and the drive is extended due to penalty...
Wow they gonna score
please jesus christ don't let bama win again
Hold lmao
Was davonte smith a 'true' freshman....?
Does Hurts think about transferring this off season. We'd love to have him
Wow 
He swung on him and didn''t connect. You also have no idea what the coach said to #48 clearly emotional and angry on the biggest stage in his life
What is it with Georgia teams choking?
Okay then stripes.
No pass rush at all anymore. 
Hopefully he just locked his legs or something.
Are these announcers watching this game with their asses? Terrible PI call.
Come the fuck on Georgia. Don''t blow this 
I don''t think the refs are allowed to call holding you guys
FUCK
WR bailing Tua out
It will never not mess with me to watch a lefty QB throw the ball
He got benched
Added to OP
I like Tua''s arm
God forbid alabama lose. 
These refs have single handedly kept Alabama in the game
Bullshit
That wasn't a whole lot *chuckle* yeah we know you're rooting for Bama to win cause you suck their dick all year ESPN
haha 
Tua's throwing motion just looks off to me, but it works.
yeh, but it helps Bama. They don't like that
took out due to too much suck
That just looked like normal hand fighting to me
fuck Tua is gonna be good
I mean I get it, but the ball went out of bounds
This is pathetic lol 
Fuuurk
\#6 bravely flopped with routine hand-fighting.
he flopped... lil bitch
go go gadget arms receiver
Rip
What a grab there by Jeudy
If Alabama could be scary good next year if this qb gets better and starts
Jesus Atalanta bout to witness a second 28-3 bullshit. 
What about the shove in the head that should've been an unsportsmanlike conduct? 
OH MY GOD WHAT THE FUCKWHY DOES ALABAMA PULL THESE SUPERMAN PLAYS OUT OF NOWHERE AT THE END OF GAMES?
Tagovailoa overthrows wide open receivers.He needs to calm down.
Bad call on PI
yeah, that was a flop
This is 900x more entertaining than any NFL game ever
Pretty weak PI call there
Will call PI, but not Holding. Gotcha. 
wtf that's weak as fuck
Ball landed 5 yards out of bounds. Thats uncatchable 
Refs to the rescue!!
The refs couldn't be more obvious
I WANT SEVEN OVERTIMES
Can they fucking call a hold? 
He literally pushed our receiver down and people are mad about the call lmfao 
Fuuuuuck
Russia 2018: its the season to flop
He got pushed down..
Fuck college football with this shit
definitely not PI
Looks like 14 took a dive too me 
Holds will no longer be called 
Hey, Big 10, **fuck your shit ass mother fucking refs**Hey ACC, y'all got some good refs
No
The refs are helping. Yes, it's like in Lord of the Rings when the eagles showed up.
Refs traded their scarlet and gray for crimson and white tonight.
That didn't look catchable
Alabama knows de wae of the devil
That's more OPI than DPI
Really refs? GTFO
Apparently anything is catchable when you're leading Alabama in the 4th quarter
Tua has NFL arm strength as a *true freshy*
What is Georgia D doing?
Refs bailing out Bama, as is tradition. 
Lol that was a flop 
Put the ref back there. This QB play is X rated awful.
Hurts showing some damn humility and maturity though by not pouting about it
He just said freshmen two time in a row 
Nick Saban > Bill Belichick > Bobby Petrino
I'm betting a true freshman qb will win the championship tonight. 
IF I HEAR THE WORD "FRESHMAN" ONE MORE TIME I SWEAR TO GOD
Int
A million times this
This is a good game lmao 
I saw the assistant, missed the female, too....needs video link!
If Bama wins I'll eat a sandwich. If Bama doesn't win I'll still eat a sandwich because I'm one hungry motherfucker. The stakes have never been higher.
From a Falcons fan, Plz close this out Georgia.
If Georgia choke this...
Bama, wutrudoin. Bama please. Bama please stop
Jeudy with the hops.
In hockey they call that "fuck you, you're getting a fucking embellishment"
if the refs weren't biased af this is 2 score game still
What, you can't even push the receiver to the ground any more???
This Parrish kid is going to sleep really well tonight. He is getting workedddddd 
B1G once again screwing things up
OK, I had to leave for a little while and just got back. WTF HAPPENED TO HURTS
I have a bad feeling about this 
Fucking hell Alabama comes back again
That was a flop
At least you don't shoot blood out of your eyes onto yourself… right?
Should've just shoved the receiver in the head instead. That's not a penalty. 
If we somehow pull this off, I'll love y'alls hatred for the coming months
What's a commercial? 
No. Fuck no
Wow..last game of the year, I guess. 
GEORGIA WHY
[deleted]
here come the refs
Not sure 14 could cover my dad 1 on 1
BAMA GONNA DO THAT BAMA THING ARENT THEY 
CFB wants Bama to win
What conference are these refs from 
Georgia choke imminent FeelsBadMan
This is giving me Chiefs flashbacks.  Way too soon
SECit just means more true freshmen 
You can't tell me that cfb isn't rigged after this post season.
not to mention, I'm pretty sure the ball fell 5 yards out of bounds.
Bama's punter looks just like one of the McPoyle brothers lmao 
RIGGED
The lefty throw continues to throw me off every time
I like football.When refs call fair game I think "yes".When refs call the game for Bama I think "no".
Weak
Alabama is going to leave just enough time on the clock for Georgia to drive down and win, aren't they?
Media talks about Freshman a lot because they probably were part of the hazing culture back in the day.
They don't call shit all night but thats fucking pi?
Georgia needs some violent hands to get off these blocks
Guys, chill...this is all a ruse by UGA to put the game on the foot of THE ROD
Good call.
SEC isn't. UT Auburn Florida fans generally want us to blow it so we don't recruit more.
I've seen some garbage from Big Ten refs but this is low 
Not a weak PI, just a well-acted one. Dumb move to push off though. 
These refs couldnt be worse 
UGA getting fucked all game.
Just bail em out lol give them the TD and let''s get on with OT 
Is that rolling I hear?
Holy shit
Ball was like 5-8 feet out of bounds
i feel like the wr initiated all of that contact
Big Ten representing!!!!
Yet the obvious PI at the end of the Belk Bowl was deemed uncatchable? LMAO. Oh well.
Georgia''s defense gonna lose this game. 
Hahaha they're gonna do it aren't they
You''re the first to notice that. 
He tripped.
Here comes the typical Alabama stall in the redzone :(
soft call
Death, taxes, and a team from Georgia blowing a championship game against a perennial powerhouse.
You mean the same wildcat UGA ran to win versus OU?
You''re shit
Some guy called that on here. A flag to extend the drive for Alabama. 
Refs singlehandedly keeping Bama in this
dont choke Georgia please
I guess you can hold people in the national championship game
TRUUUUUUEEE FRESHMAN!!!
Another chokejob by a Georgia sports team, unfortunately.
He dove. 
[deleted]
Come on Dawgs! Hunker down here, make your stand! 
Bama gonna score, leave too much time for Georgia, Georgia drives down and wins it at the buzzer.
Good to see UW can live vicariously through our dawg brothers with our poster on the sideline
Awful PI call but its Bama so we all knew it was coming 
He's wearing the wrong jersey for that.
Imagine being an OU fan. They had the game against GA won and would crush this Bama team. 
Yeah that was a good call.
I just want goggles to get the game winner
The fact these are 18- to 22-year-old children is fucking wild. This sport is crazy.
If you''ve been drinking every time they say “freshman” congrats on the afterlife 
GA teams and choking. Name a more iconic duo
How obvious was that PI? Good call?
$$$
I like to imagine Butch Jones is pounding on the door of the Film Room begging to be let in.
NICE FUCKING PLAY BAKER!!!
*steaks.
Replaced at halftime due to his play—no injury. 
True. Dabo seems like a loyal dude too though, but money does talk.
14 gettin abused lmaooo
Oh shit that was close.
How is that a bullshit flag? He shoved him to the ground?
Got benched 
But you have RichRid problems. No one envies that.
The Death Star definitely had some words with the officials at half time to remind them who controls the galaxy
These ESPN announcers are horrible. Saban must give good blowjobs. 
Yo, that would have been touchdown of the season had he held on.
dam, that was close
So weak.
I hope Bama wins after a 2 pt conversion lol
Nope strong PI. It's Bama remember? Any and all calls will be enforced in favor of Bama.
Any of the ESPN3 streams are a hell of a lot better. I''m watching the one with all the college coaches. Good to see Kevin Sumlin doing something. 
Just so I''m clear, Hurts was outright benched right? No injury, just benched? 
Give them the game refs. Fucking pieces of shit
nooow they throw the flags.  Refs going to decide the nat championship
this is happening 
Ridley almost had that one
Freshman to Freshman...Drink 2x
calvin that was so close... phew
Not yet
Nah
I hate Bama as much as most here but holy shit the anti-Bama bias in this thread is cancer. 
BETTER DEAD THAN RED YOU COMMIE
soffft
Run no pass
fuck Georgia are gonna lose arnt they
Freshman to freshman double drink!
Only having three beers on hand for this game was a poor choice
Ridley drops every contested ball ugh
They won''t show it because that was a dive and a half
They just refuse to call holding don't they.....
God damn, the refs are a great second half team.
how the fuck they do this...Then they wonder why there are conspiracy theories
It surprised me how unhappy Corso was with that flag.
No, he didn''t lol 
Bama staff watched a lot of Magnum PI so they could communicate with him.  
Bama's entire offensive line is blatantly holding on the last 3 plays.
Sucks that the refs have controlled the momentum.
hot dam, aghhhhh
Be grateful this isn't an FSU game. 
my b
[maybe?](https://media.giphy.com/media/SleotgmotWahW/giphy.gif)
I saw that one before
TRUE FRESHMAN
Has there been a single hold called against Bama tonight?
Damn that was an amazing throw
Don't pose until *after* you've stopped them
Pirouette!
That super bowl last year was good too
FRESHMAN!
goddamn Tua has overthrown every pass I've seen him make tonight
Because Alabama's done the same all game and gets no calls on it.
pushed is pretty strong. 
These threads are cancer. There's been plenty of bad calls without them diluting their argument bitching about shit like that.
Tua''s got that je ne sais quoi.
Great defense
maybe, uh, don't celebrate too hard on that incompletion, UGA. they have 3 downs to go. 
It was 20-7 and they had the ballYet I am not surprised
Baker is so good
Great catch. Bama picking up speed.
He got benched start of the 3rd
18 ya got beat stop posing
what a shitty call
OH THIS IS TURNING INTO A THRILLER
Doesn't matter UCF still Natty champs
Only if you''re Alabama
That''s a flag every time gtfo
Another great call. Officials having a great game.
I mean it's Alabama, so it's obviously PI
Ridley can't do didley tonite.
Hopefully he just locked his legs and fainted.
Yeah but the guy in the qb s place would have. And after he hands it off he's behind the play.
Guise.  I think Alabama has some True Freshmen that are playing well tonight.  I can't be sure though?
If Alabama turns it over here I will literally eat a sock and post it Tag me
OMG, THAT HAND SLAP!
Did someone say freshman?
This QB is pretty good
Fuck bama
Hold
Jalen gotta feel like shit if we win this game lol
I fucking hate our refs.
This 2nd stringer is fearless as fuck.   Slingin that ball all over the place 
so... which school Jalen Hurts is transfering to next season?
FANTASTIC play by that CB
I''ve seen enough Georgia sports teams to know how this ends. Congrats on the championship Bama.
I liked the no-call 
Guys. This Freshman is legit. 
They wouldn't have called that PI on Alabama
not all that surprising that the refs are trying to keep a game exciting with unbalanced officiating. happens in literally every sport 
I wouldn't have thrown that. Not a good dpi, imho.
Could argue Ridley should have had that again.
Quality throw right there. Just great defens
Great coverage by Baker to force the incomplete
That really was a perfect throw
Gaaaaaaaaarbage call.
GGGeorgia
I hadn't thought about the Atlanta Falcons connection for Georgia fans until now. LOL wouldn't that be something?
Benched for non production.
Just tuning in. What happened to Jalen Hurts??
Lol Calvin Ridley iz bad
Maybe not 
The state of Georgia CAN NOT HAVE ANYTHING NICE IN SPORTS
HOLY shit Baker
well shit when you give him that much time to throw it
college sports > professional
Looks like he's not playing 
What a play by the corner 
Alabama fans are pouring back into the thread. Prepare for downvotes of opinions.

Oh my God could we not pose after every play?  You're not in the NFL yet.
What the hell even is PI?
So close to being a great catch
Thinking the same thing.And UGA is the home team in Atlanta's stadium
I have work tomorrow.
They're objectively one of the most classless sports franchises in college.
Welcome to Atlanta
I've seen this happen more times than you can count
I like college football. When refs make good calls I think "That must be a mirage"When refs make bad calls I think "No"
"After review, the receiver had possession. Touchdown."
How uncatchable does a ball have to be wow 
Damn that was great fucking defense by baker
Thought we were watching football, not soccer. 
NO NONONONONONONO
his brother would have caught that 
That PI was uuuge
Dude that was normal contact. Played the refs good though 
As a neutral, this seems incredibly one-sided...
Once Alabama started losing, people higher up had to make sure they wouldn't, so they called up the refs to start giving them the game
If Georgia blows this game, I am buying stock in the Falcons/Bulldogs blowing a lead in championship games jokes. 
If Bama gets this TD prepare yourselves for the flood of flairs
Bama's found the weak spot.
Bama player sold it. Taught very well by their snake of a coach
literally everyone?
Good result on that play but rough footwork by Tua. Going to need to clean that up next year
So do I
I somehow managed to pick Bama -4.5 but Georgia straight up, which means Bama is definitely gonna win this by 3
I count 5 calls going in Bama's favor in this 2nd half.
Crazy how old both these teams are. Correct me if I''m wrong, but I''m pretty sure there aren''t any true freshman on the field. 
Herbie out to blow bama and pretend the refs aren't blatantly biased 
Nah, we are trying despite the refs
Not really. You can play against the computer or random people worldwide.
He swung on him and didn''t connect. You also have no idea what the coach said to #48 clearly emotional and angry on the biggest stage in his life
upvote if you too are a college freshman
Georgia is going to blow this.
cant see the comment asking but no, the player that collapsed on the sideline (#26 kyric mcdonald) was not the one that went after a player and was fighting with coaches to go after him from the sideline. Edit: the latter (that fouled, fought coaches) was mekhi brown #48
Refs and loving Alabama
At least both teams got across the 50 yard line in this all-SEC Championship game

[deleted]
bama can hold people in any game
Calvin Ridley just has a great name for a WR. It's like the boss from Metroid
No holding in the B1G!
Bama wins in regulation.
The freshman passes to the freshman and is tackled by the 2nd year freshman and assisted by the 3rd year freshman...freshman 
Freshman to freshman... that just killed somebody.
These refs making the Pac-12 refs look great at their jobs. 
I am dead of alcohol poison
Did he make the catch?
True freshman in the national championship. "Calm down" is not a reasonable request.
If this was the NFL there would be flags all over the place for offensive holding.  This is ridiculous.
I'm clenched.
People love to complain about the refs damn
They're going to
Officials got the call from Buffalo Wild Wings. 
GODS PLS
Three more downs you Dawgs, three more downs, hunker down!
There is holding on every play but this is fucking obnoxious.
Nice lil pushoff by the wr
Benched.
Benched
These refs sure do want Alabama to win 
Offensive PI
Almost threw my beer instead of drinking it
true
Oh okay, fair enough.  As much as I hate Bama, I thought he played good last week... big improvement on last year. Strange
I can''t take more of this shit.. 
Lost so much respect for Saban for putting #48 back in to play
 The fucking refs

Beautiful
Georgia please 
They call that but don't call hugging earlier in the game? This is insane. 
Bama is working some black magic. 
Georgia keeps tackling them forward, giving them and extra yard or two each time...
I can only hope.
That wouldn''t have knocked down a high school freshman 
Thank Goodness for the AT&T pylon cam brought to you by Nationwide giving you the best look at the All State Safe Hands play of the game.
Hey, I'm not watching the game and haven't seen any highlights or anything but holy shit these refs are awful, am I right guys?
I agree that was PI but if you call there you have to call some of the other ones in this game too
Gotta put Najee back in. He's way too good
Tune in to the BufferESPN app to follow the game 5 minutes behind everyone else
Regardless of the outcome, the last 3 NC games have been 4th quarter gems.
Alabama 34 to 27 in double OT
HODL!!!!!!!
What no flag? Lol 
Takes balls to dive that like in front of a nationally televised audience. 
They *confirmed* the call.  It didn't just stand.The guy was still trying to bring the ball up from his crotch into his hands as he went out of bounds.  He was fully past the boundary before the ball stopped moving in his hands/across his body.  You don't have possession when the ball is still moving in your hands.I can tell you don't *like* the call, but it was unquestionably the correct one according to the rules.
Looks like everyone is super satisfied with the refs Kinda glad I'm not watching 
If we win, bye bye Jalen. 
What is he?
Alabama's receiver initiated the contact. What a joke. 
Shifty!
Refs can you fuck off please
Pls UGA
Turnover inc.
I feel you. I was the same way with ihop for like 7 years before going back. Ha 
Georgia''s black collar/white helmet stripe combo make me irrationally angry. 
My heart CANNOT take this!!!
[Status of Bama comeback](https://media.giphy.com/media/rl0FOxdz7CcxO/giphy.gif).
Yup. The benched him at half because he was garbage the first half.
Benched
https://mobile.twitter.com/wonderousatx/status/950578700201885696
Same lol. 25-2, 2016 sec player of the year, led his team to two straight title games, bench. 
Shouldn't even fucking be here and the refs are trying to give it to them too corrupt as shit
Sheesh
Correct 
F R E S H M A N
This ESPN stream is buffering so badly all I get to see is everyone lining up over and over again.
Bama is going for it on 4th if they don't get thsi
With a top tier receiver as well.
The last thing I want is for bama to win, but they're outplaying Georgia. 
NCAA 2005 Update: My senior QB is having a really bad day as he threw his second pick of the day on his 3rd pass attempt. Arkansas ball at the Florida 47 with 3:58 to go in the 1st half
God that would have been nasty
Refs handing the game to NCAAs darlings.  
liking the Jalen hurts cam on the command center
*sigh*was nice while it lasted, boys. time to watch basketball for a while
Ah so this is the MSST game again
r/MemeEconomy
Nick decided to bench him at the half 
They can't keep getting away with it...
Y'all had a better SOS  and we both lost our last game. I wouldn't have blamed the committee for putting y'all in over us  
Bama is on full throttle here.
Nope
Alabama fucking manhandled a guy on third down with no DPI call. This was weak as fuck compared to that. 
71 shoves that whole fucking pile 5 yards farther lol.
[deleted]
Bama is gonna win it on a FG and I'm gonna throw my TV out the window
fumble risk running the freshman qb
Surrender cobra out this one's over. 
The entire game*It''s why Bama doesn''t deserve any accolades. They''re exempt from the rules, so they have a built in advantage
Not just freshman, TRUE freshman
He sucks. For benched
> That kids in some deep shit.I was waiting for everyone's favorite S&C coach to descend on him.
would've been an all-time catch.  great defense.
Give it to gold hands
He's been benched since halftime.
They would crush this Bama team. I was rooting for them.
Alabama/ Saban are pure evil, and not in a joking way.
Ugh, Bama is about to make my day a lot worse, and it was already a bad day.
Also Julio Jones
Yes
Falg
Cause he forced the drop...
I WANT QUAVO TO HOLD THE TROPHY DAMN IT 
Not 1
You are now on a watch list
I could really use a Coca Cola after that great AT&T pylon cam view!
That''s the difference between handfighting and DPI. Don''t go all homer on me now GA peeps
Georgia fans' asses tightening.
Not sure, announcers must not have talked about him yet
Flair up
dead in 3 minutes
GATOR NEEDS HIS GAT BACK, PUNK ASS BITCH!
Man I feel for the state of Georgia. I''m sorry the football gods have failed you so.
A literal neckbeard in the wild.
Man that call was soft as fuck
It''s just bias. He was interfered with. 
Lotta clenched buttholes in this stadium tonight
Man I thought I was rooting against Bama some of y'all crazy 
Poor elephant 
Remember when holding used to be a thing. Just thought that we haven't had a single holding call all night. 
Is that one of the dudes from Friends? 
REFS SUCK
Can we blow up the moon to get rid of the Tide? I say we start a petition.
If Alabama wins we all write our governors to make UCF the national champs
ridley pushed off
Sold his soul
Okay this is good
Oh boy do I have news for you!!!!
Kd is their coach?
We''ll probably be getting this same matchup, in this same stadium, on the first weekend of December the next couple of years. I''m not complaining.
We're going to be into 7OT
I miss those commercials
THROW IT TO 48
fuck bama, but the kid is from ewa beach. it is not a good part of oahu. 
That couple lol "Oh honey I think they're gonna score"
Very excited how a Georgia team will fuck it up.
If ridley goes in the first round I'll eat my hat
Oh shiiiitttt
Herby?
100%
Oh no Georgia what is you doin
Yo wtf
Huge stop there
That double chin lol
nothin. doin.
Goggles will break the tie with :30 left to win
Yeah if only Calvin was purple and dragon like 
Not injured. Pulled after first half. Look at the stats between the two halves and get back to me. 
When that pass was batted down i say "OOOooh NICE!"  Apparently my gf said "I love you" over the phone and I didn't hear it.  Appropriate response either way yeah?
Must go for it here
Question. If Bama wins this game, does Hurts lose his job?
Where's the "digs freshman" flair?
Great attempt by Ridley, but fantastic coverage Georgia
but the best players do and have always gotten special treatment. Saban is also notoriously a POS so why are people surprised by his decision to let the kid play
Alabama just don't get flagged do they? Like is it against the CFB rulebook? 
Yeet
I think we're going to get some free football.
You have to go for it on 4th. 
GO FOR IT
That's just cruel.
Been there, noticed that
Commentators haven't even brought up the language barrier Tua is overcoming.
DID ANYONE SAY 49ERS VS RAVENS GOALINE STAND PT 2?
ASSBLAST THESE FUCKFACES LETS GO DAAWGS
Alabama flopping their way to a tiegame 
UGA is gonna blow this, aren''t they? 
That rapidly nodding Surrender Cobra was amazing.
STUFFED
OH SHIT NICE STOP
This freshman talking point has been beaten to death.. enough
This doesn't look like a real sentence lol 
saban is not happy
GO FOR IT
Gooooo for it?????
Huge stop!! 
That loser will talk about that drop his entire life
5th gifted call for Bama this game 
that band music is intimidating
they'd be dumb to ever go back to Jalen
Does anyone know how old this 'Bama QB is, I don't think I've seen him before.
ooooooooooooh boy, what do you do now?
Great stop
DAAAMM, SON!
Go for it Saban. NO BALLS
GO FOR IT BAMA
fuck these refs
I live in Georgia. If they end up losing the meltdown will be visible from space.
SheeeeeeitNorth Korea announced they will send a team to South Korea in the olympics.Also this is a good game
Weak ass play call
Go for it
Excellent stop
Leave it to a georgia sports team to take this shit to the very last second. 
D
Saban is not happy.
Fuck this shit, Bama. We're getting robbed. If you win it's because if shitty refs. We're out playing you. 
Atta boy
You gotta go.
Hate that cal
Saban seems upset. 
That's the play call huh. 
Oh yesss fg time 
No way Bama kicks, right?
Go for it
Fucking Calvin. Riley probably would've caught that.
good ole run stuff
push off on WR there. no call
Oh i couldnt agree more. What a class act!
HERE WE GOOOOOOOOOOO
you have to go for it. 
Ooooh weeeee what a stop
Hugeeee 4th down
Does Bama go for it?
stuffed
Ross from Friends is a Georgia fan
Great effort by the D there
Are they gonna go for it?
Whaddaya do, coach?
Oh boy I can't wait for bama to win on a last second bullshit call by the refs!
Terrible call
They should go for it
Go for it
the refs are really fucking this game. but i also like seeing a true freshmen come in at half in the NC and come back but then i also really fucking hate alabama.
Done
He got pulled at halftime for going 3/8 21ydsq
What a shit call on 3rd down.
If the previous call was a defensive PI then that play was on offensive push off.
go for it
Last game of the year, can''t hold anything back now 
take the points or go for it?
That was a B1G call. lol.
Trent Thompson on defense is fucking terrifying
This could be your game here
They're going for it!
holy shit he just met the Georgia fucking wall right there hahah
That's what it looked like to me, just didn't know if anyone had a name yet.
Sweaty Palms
Gotta go for it 
Go for it this is huge
Man saban looks pissed
So do they go for it or kick the field goal?
Yeah, but we're, well, us. And Bama's, well, Bama...
He's been out the whole 2nd half. He played like ass first half so they went with the freshman
He came at him didn''t even connect his helmet bumped his chest. These are grown men out here not middle schoolers
Incoming PI call after stop. 
What ya gonna do, Saban?
saban's gotta go for this
Go for it Bama
Are they going for it?
Tua is so shifty! His fakes and real plays are so tough for me to read. Edit: I use the word shifty one fucking time and the announcers say it 10 seconds later. Now I sound like that guy.
Tua's throwing talent and pocket presence are way ahead of Hurts's, and it's never going to get closer.
Weak playcall
I didn''t realie alabamas band played the same song 100000x a game. Worse than Tennessee with rocky top
Take the points. 
Gd this game got exciting
IM JUST HERE FOR ANGRY NICK SABAN FACES
great run stop
ASS CHEWIN
Did y'all know that On this day in 1877, Crazy Horse and his warriors–outnumbered, low on ammunition and forced to use outdated weapons to defend themselves–fight their final losing battle against the U.S. Cavalry in Montana.It's a shame they gotta schedule a game today now we can't celebrate this historical anniversary.
Go dogs come on you motherfuckers make Saban cry
Holy shit ballsy call.Don't like it.
This may be for all the marbles. 
HERE WE GO BOYS
Live is rough
Offensive lineman being able to push people forward after being stopped shouldn't be legal if defenses can't do the same tbh 
Stuffed!!!!!!
There hasn't been a holding call all game, calm down
LAST 5 MINUTES OF THE SEASON BOYS!IT''S BEEN AN HONOR!
#F R E S H M A N
Butt is puckering harder than a grandma kissing a baby
"Harris is plastered in the backfield!"Well maybe he should stop drinking on the job!
go for it nick, if you kick, you could kick six.
They gotta go for it
Was really hoping Alabama wouldn't after that inept first quarter
Go for it Saban! Don't be a coward!
Georgia only plays defense in the red zone. And has given up offense. 
FRESHMEN! 
Hold the line dawgs
4th and five national championship on the line right here
Pls
For fuck's sake, who is in charge of the offensive playcalls for Bama? Their 3rd and short playcalling is pathetic
That was a bad playcall 
How on earth do you feel comfortable running the back there? 
I'm in
Please stop him
Georgia''s a girl''s name
4 T H D O W NTHDOWN
If only bama still had the Lane train.
Lol, Saban hit whoever he was yelling at with a "I don't have time right now but I will fucking lay into you later" look.
The fuck Saban so angry about. Refs on his team
Not even a question that you go for it
I can see why they'd go for it here 
fuck yeah!
KNEES WEAK
For the life of me I cannot rememberWhat made us think that we were wise andWe'd never compromiseFor the life of me I cannot believeWe'd ever die for these sinsWe were merely freshmen
Bum fights
Bro, this is 2018, you can't say that. The preferred term is commentator American.
PA boot left
Already the champs of our hearts 
Well put. 
FAKE PUNT
If I was him I''d already be looking at places to transfer.
This may be an important 4th down
Tau did the false snap, saw the Georgia right side jump, then still ran the play to the right? Edit: And then he misses the game clock.
It's simultaneously frustrating and hilarious when players celebrate while the play is still going.
Pls
Including the stadium itself.
Saban might hate daboll
Can Alabama fans please acknowledge the gift they were given by that PI?
a field goal wont really help you right now will it?
I'd kick it
Anybody else just see Ross from friends look alike in the stands
100% right cal to go for it
play of the game
Don''t be Roper
Nick saban looks so stressed I'm afraid he is just gonna whip his dong out and start beating his meat
Oh man I'm shaking someone hold me
Bout to be ball game, folks. 
get a stop here please
Go for it
Is not and never will be...
So your excuse is this should continue because it always has and Saban is a piece of shit. Got it.
Trust that defense.
Commentators should have to know the rules before they commentate on them. Oh, Kirby, does one "extending his arms" make a play illegal? Improperly laid foundation for the call. 
Doitdoitdoitdoitdoit
If you can''t get a few yards when you need it, you don''t deserve the championship 
I'm going to shit a diamond.
Rich people don't give blow jobs, they pay other people to
well duhhhhhhhhh
Plus it was Pac 12 refs. 
So many people with type 2 diabetes really nervous right now.
I hate UGA but I think I hate Nick Sabin more.... 
If they don't win I'm scared to leave the house tomorrow.
i dunno the fucking stream is frozen
hey man he's handling it well, cheering for his offense
Bring the leinie's, we're gonna bag dah turdy point buck!
Pls Georgia pls
New England Patriots gonna score again.
Atlanta is a cursed city for football. All Georgia football fans, get it together.
XMOOOOOOOON
[I guess Ross got into Bama, good for him](https://twitter.com/recordsANDradio/status/950579464966197248)
The dude's got a clean pocket. He can escape when he needs to, but he's doesn't have to do that all that often.
It all comes down to this 
Why go for it? Tons of time left
This is a cause I can get behind.
No longer in the stadium
How important is that false start for the missed field goal now 
True but gotta admit it's a pretty huge storyline
Is Jason Garrett calling plays right now? I recognize this playbook.
this is a good game!
I have to throw up.
[deleted]
You got me feeling all kinds of conflicted.
"this is a big play" --John Madden
I'd never have a drinking contest with anyone from the state of Georgia that likes football.
Sabans mad...make me happy
Georgia fans, how do you feel right now? 
FG gets you nothing. Still need a TD.
If you want to know why there's 2 SEC teams in the title game, look no further than #78 on Georgia and #94 on Bama. Your big men can't do that. 
Only score is an 80 yard tuddy kick the FG and trust your defense!!
I have seen 6 Bama flairs in the past 6 minutes; prepare for it to be 90%+ for a few mins.
There you go! Roquan, Thompson, you Dawgs you, and Carter too! One more down boys, hunker down! Hunker down!
Whats offensive holding? Never heard of it. Watch what happens if Georgia tries the same shit next drive.
Drink
What is the world do big 10 refs have to gain by being biased for Alabama lol?
TRUE
The madlad is going for it!
Go for iiiiiiit!
Them freshman are on my Watchlist if you catch my drift
LETS GO DAWGS!!!1!!
ARMS HEAVY
NOT LIKE THIS
I cannot survive an OT in the national championship if it's gonna be on a god damned Monday night
14 for 17 on 4th down this year? What the fuck?
That's a huge mistake.
Freshman
Hay SabanYou need endzone brah
Ohhh shit 
One timeout left.
True but gotta admit it's a pretty huge storyline
They have playclocks in high school right?
DO YOU THINK VISORS ARE COOL???
The word "freshman" is starting to sound like gibberish to me. 
Wheres Trumpy
78 looking like a stud
Gonna need some help from the refs, here. Can we get that play call reviewed?
[deleted]
Streaming on ESPN2 works better and Landon Collins is fun to listen too.
t r u e f r e s h m a n
Baaaaaaad timeout.
DAE TRUE FRESHMAN
Truuuuue freshman
Yikes. They will need that timeout later.
Take the points
Go for it
Who's that player on the Bama sidelines in the big Bama jacket?  Derrick Henry?
It's in the Nick Saban checkbook.
Bama chick didn''t want the Georgia fan to hear her trick play call.
Saban looking around for Lane because he''s pissed
TRUE FRESHMAN
Trenton Thompson is going to be a star
Go Hawaiian man!
IF BAMA SCORES THEY WILL GET MORE POINTS
frEsh m aaa nn nn n
Hey guys did you know he's a freshmen?!? 
Saban's dynasty on the line here.
Took a page right out of the Louis C.K. playbook.
Bad coaching. What the fuck.
He shouldn't be held responsible,He is just a freshman.
pls no not again
Rip to everyone drinking whenever they say freshman
anyone know what year the bama QB is, im thinkin sophomore?
Rambling on about football stuff, filling in awkward pauses with commentary, and when Georgia got the sideline warning he kept repeating that they got a warning and the first time was a penalty. 
why didnt they give it to scarborough
That hit 0 before the timeout. Should be 5 yards. 
Real dumb decision here, with their defense.
that defense is ELITE
Gotta go on 4th - otherwise why run it there
78 makes a big play and is not celebrating like a madman. Knows it isn't over 
OMG. what a game WHAT A GAME!
Rambling on about football stuff, filling in awkward pauses with commentary, and when Georgia got the sideline warning he kept repeating that they got a warning and the first time was a penalty. 
So many worse things happen behind the scenes of a football team and players have done a lot worse and played
Oh, that makes sense.  Sorry for being harsh.  I just smh whenever someone drafts my team's players.  We are the kings of inconsistency. 
Freshmen or not that's inexcusable.
I love pylon cams... until they give he god damn thing a sponsor
flashbacks to last February 
yikes that was a big mistake.
My poor fingernails
Me too buddy
Bench him and put in a true freshman
true freshman
Did Jalen get injured or something? 
They just need to kick a FG. Refs got their back. 
True but gotta admit it's a pretty huge storyline
On this day in 1877, Crazy Horse and his warriors–outnumbered, low on ammunition and forced to use outdated weapons to defend themselves–fight their final losing battle against the U.S. Cavalry in Montana.Why do we schedule the game on such a historic holiday?
>you can excuse the true freshmansure.
Come on Bama, just kick the FG, Georgia will forget to hand the ball to Freeman- I mean, Michel and you'll get the ball back in more than enough time to get a TD.
I'm surprised the refs didn't find a way to flag Georgia for that and gift Bama another first down
#F
Its probably houndstooth
It sure is
Hurts is like "Saban, pls put me in"
Stop, my liver can only take so much...
FRESHMEN don't know about clocks, duh!
True freshman mistake.
“You can excuse the true freshman”No, this is the 4th quarter of the national championship game. You cannot. 
Come on Georgia you need a stop here 
Let it burn.
They passed instead of running and Ryan took a sack which pushed them out of field goal range. Kyle Shanahan was heavily criticized for this playcalling.
That''s a wasted TO. Should''ve kicked a quick FG and your defense has been hot. Chance to get ball back.
Kiffin is gonna nut so hard if they don't get this 4th down
Thompson has been a horse tonight. 
Works for me
[Saban right now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgRE6BPhN2I)
Great defense by the corner. Attacked the arm after the catch, pulled the arm away causing the drop.Don't talk about something when you don't know it well enough
No chris, you can''t just excuse a player for not looking at the play clock and losing a timeout.
this is fucking nus, aghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Oh boy. 4th down under 4 minutes. Here we go!! 
Not a bad call honestly.  If the QB had realized it they would have had three time-out and had Georgia in bad field position.
Nick Saban wants to fuck a dog
BLIIIIIITZ GODDAMNIT
That's a painful timeout to take.
please fucking go for it. Put in Najee and have him run someone over
I know that's what I do when I'm stressed
The truest freshmen there ever were
Grandpa Saban rescuing his grandson Tua Morty from another escapade
T R U E  F R E S H M A N
I have a feeling Tua is going to ruin my last football season as an Auburn student next year
Coaches took way to long getting that play in
Freshman
Shoulda let the clock expire and kick a field goal. Timeouts are too valuable. Edit: fuck
They ded 
Fucking tell me about it
this is why he needed more experience
Ooh that's VY's music! Do they miss Lane Kiffin?
I can't take it
No. No you cannot excuse the true freshman for not knowing there was no time on the play clock. It's the naty
Fuck yeah go for it, this is football at its best
Huuuuge TO
If I hear true freshman one more time. I'm going to be irked.
Georgia fans would losing this game be worse than losing the Super Bowl to New England or not as bad?
Anyone who actually did that true freshman drinking game is currently in the ICU
Never go full Falcons
Gotta go for it
Prepare you sirens, ambulances
B1G
HERES THE GAME^MAYBE
Holy shit. 
I don''t understand why Bama isn''t using both QB''s. We shit on Hurts but his legs are lethal and would be great to have in rotation 
This seems way too risky for Saban 
This is almost just like the champ game against LSU and Alabama a few years ago, Field Goals, field goals, more field goals and even more field goals.
Kick it. 
Hey if it helps him reduce stress...
Seriously. Ray Charles saw that run.
What good does 3 do you? You still need a TD next possession. Might as well try to get it nowPlus you only need a few yards now as opposed to 50+ on the next drive
2
TRUE FRESHMAN... FRESHMAN
This is game right here bois. 
Hot take 
Projection? We know how you deal with stress now :p
SWEATER SPAGHETTI
IM ALSO HERE FOR OT I HOPE ALL YOUR HEARTS ARE IN GOOD CONDITION
TRUE FRESHMAN
good D
A true "true" freshman mistake. 
No
It's your conference. How should I know?
tell me who she is then? the one in the Nissan commercial.
fuck I'm gonna get alcohol poisoning taking a sip after every "freshmen" mention. 
of course go for it. 3 points, down 7 with 4 mins left does nothing for you
"You can excuse the true freshman" Fuck you ESPN keep sucking bamas dick 
How many times do they have to mention Freshman, geez, point taken
Going for it is definitely the right call. Come on Dawgs stop em
As long as he finishes on 48''s face, I''m cool with it. 
Good way to relieve stress I hear.
Most losses in the cfb playoffs 
no you can't excuse the true freshman
Lame Kiffin sitting at home grinning.
Alabam goes for it and gets the TD lul
Commentators are defending the refs. There''s a reason they only showed one replay.
I want to to puke
ESPN: Inexperienced Real College Freshman, First Time on Camera
Kony 2012 all over again
Rambling on about football stuff, filling in awkward pauses with commentary, you can see the other coaches getting annoyed, and when Georgia got the sideline warning he kept repeating that they got a warning and the first time was a penalty. 
Is everyone else scared shitless?
Shh bby is ok
CFPucker Bowl '18
Did you know he's a true freshman?
YES! Overtime or bust!
Saban what was that playcall
Go for it! Go for it!
[deleted]
Alabama Crimson Refs
Pls pls pls pls UGA 
They teach how to count in Knoxville?
So when does UCF come in to cash in Money in the Bank?
Go for it or no? I say kick the fg, especially in a college football game
Yeah. ok.
Good God watchESPN is shit. Cannot go 30 seconds without buffering
**TRUE FRESHMAN**
I really badly want Georgia to win but I also want this game to go into 5OT so Bama please score
Always beat it before going for it on 4th
God he''s awful. 
13th year freshman here
No
They put him back into the game. Unreal. 
Lol WTF they're passing out pure oxygen in the sideline huddles now?? Lmfao
Gotta go for it. Bama needs a TD either way
Georgia sports is HeartAttack central
He'll be back in sure. 
You can't excuse it for him because he's a freshman. He's been playing football for presumably his entire life. He knows about the fucking play clock. It's the National Championship game, you can't just go "eh it was a mistake but you're a freshman so it's fine"
Saban ain't excusing shit
Angry Saban is scary Saban
Nice AT&T  pylon Taco Bell  cam Lexus replay. 
Rambling on about football stuff, filling in awkward pauses with commentary, you can see the other coaches getting annoyed, and when Georgia got the sideline warning he kept repeating that they got a warning and the first time was a penalty. 
Imagine any other coach pulls the 25-2 qb for a true freshman.
F R O S H M O V EROSHMOVE
77, 430 is announced attendance for Championship Game
I''m with you
RESHMAN
Georgia freshman makes a mistake:  That's just a lack of management by the QBAlabama freshman makes a mistake: Well you can't blame the freshman for goofiing.
Georgia fans, I'm just as scared as you are right now, just to let you know.
I'm not gonna live to see 2019. My heart's gonna give out. 
Rambling on about football stuff, filling in awkward pauses with commentary, you can see the other coaches getting annoyed, and when Georgia got the sideline warning he kept repeating that they got a warning and the first time was a penalty. 
Hot take: this is an important 4th down by true freshmen. 
Somebody take that fucking whistle away from that ref good god.
Put both QBs in there and have Tua throw to Hurts
I am clenched. Let's go doggies 
Why does that matter? Do points win games?
What an idiot. Got buckled too lmao 
Saban not happy.
Hmm explain?
Oh...
Heart attacks have the same effect on a coach 
Booth review
I was just about to post the same thing! Damn we get it already
BIG IF TRUE
"You can excuse the true freshman for not being aware"Wtf? Hell no, it's not like this is the first ever time the dude has played with a delay clock. Stop shoving the true freshman narrative down our throats
Pitch it to 48, clothesline his way in
I wouldn''t. Gets you within four with 4 minutes left. Get the First down or pray you can pin them to a three and out and take another shot. 
You can throw mine out. I'm living in 2010 still. I've got renters insurance.It'll be pure fun. 
It's been a wild ride.
Gotta be at work in 7 hours.  Fuck it.
TIL true freshmen don't know about play clocks
Every time I hear "true freshman," i hear Dick Vitale... It's just a thing. No one loves freshmen like Dick Vitals loves freshmen.
They're gonna get the stop I can just feel itEdit: *sigh*
Big if true
I already did rip
Yeah. That's exactly why they ran it. They were going for it no matter what. 
I got butterflies and no dog in the fight 
Freshman freshman
Come on guys, be PC. freshperson
I''d give it a whirl 
I'll give anything to hear it in English.  Have to listen to these Mexican announcers while on vacation who have no clue what they're talking about 
DRINK
You need a TD eventually. You don''t get this close often. No reason to assume you''ll get a better chance on the next drive. This is an easy decision. 
Plenty of time 
Just his ego.
Anus **Clenched**
Cover the fade to Ridley!
[deleted]
Can't kick. Still need a TD. 
So is Cali
Umm no you can''t excuse the freshman for being completely unaware of the playclock with under 5 minutes on 4th down in the national championship. They have playclocks in high school too
First time trying out live comments on mobile this is bananas 
This is much worse than I expected.... I''m literally shaking.
Please UGA. Hold the line dawgs
Scott Linehan
He seems like a classy dude unlike, say, 48.
Georgia is gonna throw this game away, huh?
Just in case some of you weren't aware, there are two True Freshman quarterbacks in this game. 
Georgia DB's need to stay on top of their men, they are always out of position to break up plays.
IF THEY DO NOT SCORE THEY WILL KEEP THEIR CURRENT AMOUNT OF POINTS
Yeah I don't get that. Make a field goal and get the onside kick back.. You still have to score a td
14 of 17 on fourth down. Wow
I just turned the game on. Been lookin through this thread... Has the reffing really been that bad or are there just a bunch of whiners spamming?
ONE DOWN GO DAWGS
i would kick fg
Please stop it D
I really give Jalen Hurts a lot of credit. He's out there supporting his team. Not gonna lie I'd probably be pouting in the locker room lol
I hope no one made a drinking game out of them saying freshman
The freshman you can, the coach you cant 
Alabama players are all freshman. 
Spurrierrrr
TRUE FRESHMANNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN
Saban always letting his assistant coaches have it after a negative play. You're the head coach...own it yourself jackass.
Wasn't that a bad timeout call? Just take the penalty and kick the field goal. You need those timeouts.
No he was just bad
“You can excuse the true freshmen for not knowing the play clock” Uhh, no you fuckin can''t.
Sauce? 
True freshman before timeout, finish your drink before the next play.
7-1 7-1 7-1!!
muy caliente
That's gotta be a fan who keeps going nuts on the whistle 
Her Her Her you can excuse the red shirt freshmen.  These announcers might just want Bama to win
Auburn knows this too well
God I hope they thrown in at least 20 more min of commercials. 
Wait is Tua a Freshman???
This game is lit
Yeah he doesn't take clocks 201 until next fall.
Hey did ya know...True freshman!
OHHHHHHH SHIT 
Fuck. SALT SHAKERS AT THE READY
Well then

HOLLLY SHEEET
Wow

IM TELLING YOU THE VISORS COMING OFF

Wow, what a fucking throw.
Fowler is terrible tonight.
Hold
shiiiiiiiiit
God fucking damn it.
Boom!
What the fuck.
How does Ridley get that open?  Lol
You have to throw the ball on that last play to avoid situations like this... that might''ve sealed the game. I would''ve been comfortable taking the 3 and relying on my defense to get a stop... NVM lol 
Lmao Georgia is trash
Bama went to Andy Reid's school of clock management
Fuck
Refs just missed a false start
fuuuuuuuuuck, Georgia. FUCK
HOLDING????
48 died for this
OMG

Wow. Have to give him credit. That was great poise and a great pass.

Don't jump! Don't jump offsides, play smart you Dawgs! We're asking so much of you, we know! You're tired, we are too, but you can end this game here you Junkyard Dawgs, Hunker Down!

#LONG LIVE TUA
Skinny Aaron Judge is fucking good
Fuck Bama. But Tua is a beast. 
whose got money on the game?
Are the lights going crazy?
I hate Fowler
Do these refs even know holding is illegal
Bama was offsides....fucking bullshit the RB jumped!!!!!!1111
There were like 3 holds on that play lmao 
Thought I saw one of Bama's players jump early. 
Big jump by that receiver on the bottom 
They gave them so much time and space. 
We exist in the dankest timeline, confirmed.
We got a game
Not like this
WHOOP THERE IT IS
Big balls freshman
Seriously?
TUA AND RIDLEY ARE MY NEW DADDIES.
Refs keeping Bama in this fucking game. This is a joke
I saw some grade A holding on that one.
Georgia sports... We are cursed
lol Bama gonna fucking win on a field goal
I hate this game.
That was incredibly clutch.
There is no god
GOTS US A GAME
Hey Georgia?
The choke is real
Well, this may not age well. 
And that's why you are'nt paid 7+mil
Oh no. 
Now it has become fun. 
what a game
Such a bad hold
Gifted! 
Baltimore Ravens first rounder Calvin Ridley finally making a play
Holy forking shirt
Saban get's the timeout because it's against the CFB rulebook to penalize Nick Saban. Note:Rule #2. He get's unlimited time out's if it means no flag is thrown. 
YEEEEEEE finally calvin gets one
THERE'S MY BOY RIDLEY!
25 for good measure. 
Ditto. Lots of time. Get the 3 points, then rely on the Defense.
Damn the state of Georgia needs to just shut down all sports for the rest of eternity.
What is the lights doin
OVERTIME OVERTIME OVERTIME
That might have been the BIGGEST most OBVIOUS hold in my entire life lmao. 
Holy hell what a game!
Yep, left just enough time for Georgia to drive it down the field with no time left... how awesome would that be?
Go. For. Two.
Fucking brutal
OMG
lol no way. how'd that get there
Oh fuck Georgia :/
WOOOOOOO
Yes
In it's defense, you are on the most commented thread-series of the new year.
They just won't die.
God. Dammit.
Fuck.
Massive hold on the line
There's Georgia 
So predictable.
To everyone who went to be early:# Ha-ha
Miss the pat 
Fuck
Guess Georgia has to throw away the conservative play call book?
ROLL DAMN TIDE
Harris isn't old enough to drink. He should be kicked off the team for underage drinking. /s, obviously
What? I''m at the game. 
No fucking way
I'm really liking this new qb
WELLLPPPPPP
4Q 4th and 4 with 4 min leftFuck

Wouldn't see the end of the game
Yep Georgias done.
Thank you BAS3D BIG TEN REFS
THAT, was a BIG TIME throw. 
The Gamble paid off. 
UGA doesn''t want to win this game, do they? 
Man that was ballsy

Omg
Say no more, fam. 
The PlayStation Vue ESPN stream cutting out now too.
Massive missed hold right in the middle of the line. 
Georgia for the love of god please win this here
Don't let this big Bama comeback distract you from the fact the the Falcons blew a 25 point lead in the Super Bowl
OH MY GOD. TUA IS TRUE!!!
I'M SO SIC'N FUCKIN TIRED OF THE CRIMSON TIDE. QUIT NOW. PLEASE FUMBLE.
Wow.
YEAAAAAH!
How you let him get open there is beyond me. Fucking stupid 
How are CFB games so consistently good. It's really amazing at this point.
Do you know if there are any other freshmen on the field?
Saban has a ton of rings and basically faces all of his former assistants coaching in the SEC. He looses to his is a blemish
Georgia sports strikes again 
3rd & 9 wasn''t DPI
Bama is gonna bama. 
TOUCHDOWN
Are you not entertained?
Good thing I didn't...
Didn't think of that, admirable of the coach to keep it quiet but I wouldn't blame him at all for telling
T U AUA
Illegal pick play? Nah!! not on Alabama! 
I wish a pox on all of these refs for extending these garbage drives 
ARE YOU SHITTING ME !!!!
this game is a series of unbelievable events
Jesus... this is gonna go to OT and Bama is going to win on a controversial call huh? KMS
well fuck
My entire apartment complex heard that HOLY FUCK
Wat
holy shit. great pass
What the shit!!!
> Finally makes an impactSavage
FUUUUUUCK MAN. COME ON GEORGIA. GET YOUR SHIT TOGETHER
Georgia teams are not good in national football championship games...
wow
Calvin: "not today little brother"
ROLL TIDE!
yep
Aw fuck I can't believe you've done this
please kill me
Alabama isn't doing good. Georgia is just blowing it.
Tua has such a quick release. Holy shit, I thought he was done.
Ugh
#WHAT A FUCKING CATCH!!!!!!!!!!!!
Fucking 
God dammit Bama is gonna win this aren't they
How was he so open
DIAPER DANDY
Georgia I hate you so much right now
I''m going to bed, bye.
That UGA DT was getting fucking mauled wtf?
I'm dying over here. 
You'd think Georgia would have the advantage in OT the way they've been running it, but will they stick with it?  If it gets there of course
Well I guess it's not a bad call if you get the touchdown
"I'm not going to be the Alabama coach."
...why do I watch this game year after year when Alabama's gonna just fuck it all up at the end anyways?
Ah yes the University of Georgia "Atlanta Falcons" Bulldogs in action. 
#ho le fuk
UCF the true champs 
Why why why. Why do they keep getting away with it?
OH SHIT OH SHIT He knows da WAE
jesus dawgs 
I will implode if we hit overtime
Whatever he is doing is working. How can you judge anything he does?
If your hands aren't on the ball, then you cannot be exerting control of the ball. 
Well, duh. What else could possibly happen there?
Good night. 
Gotta say, watching the announcer-less stream has been a great time
FOOTBALL MACHINE BROKE
Damn, this Tua kid is clutch Is he a true freshman?
OT !!!!
Tie game. 
ded
Finally now I am interested 
Oh lawdy its a miracle!!!
Patriots are worse than the incest squad every day of the week.
Regardless of the score, #48 is a dick
FUUUUUUCCCCCCCKKKKKKK
oh
I dislike Alabama.
Thought that was a false start on the receiver at the start of the play 
Ugh Georgia please don''t do this 
Boys and girls, we got us a football game. 
What a game!!!
Are they true freshman though?
There are no words for my rage. I now know why humans commit war and kill.
Ooooh Georgia baby noooo, what is you doin?
Of course they score when they hold all fucking day.Why even hope when evil always prevails?
Well shit
Tua! We all know Hurts would have ran to the sideline and thrown it out of bounds there
Um, wasn't that offensive pass interference? That definitely seemed like a pick
Colt Brennan is pumping his fists somewhere
Fuck
Too much time for Fromm
motherfucker
YES!!
its happening
lol god damn the state of georgia loves choking
What a play! 
My god that kid has a cannon.
The scout team (led by Tua) only lost to the starters by a FG with 5 seconds left in play in our spring game.Our future is just fine. 
It just doesn't get any truer than this
Fromm time
WOW what a huge play. Pick 6 coming, Bama wins
What. The. Fuck. 
Holy fuck. Georgia football is fucking cursed in championship games.
Holy cow, ESPN All-Classic #1 right here. 
TUAAAAA
RIP livers everywhere
The Tide tried to make it tied but died. Whoops, I lied. 
The state of Georgia has to be cursed. 
you have got to be kidding me!!!
AHHHHHH
Most blatant hold I've ever seen in my life lol
Biggest missed hold of the night, but hey no call for bama right?
Georgia about to blow it to a true freshman.  God dammit. 
Yoooo Tua
Game over. Georgia can''t score and Bama will get the ball back and drive for a game-winner. 
HOW DOES SABAN DO IT
Holy shit what luck. Better to be lucky...
Fromm wouldn't have it any other way 
Roll fucking Tide. 
Hooray!
It's been awful 
Georgia is cursed
Is holding not a thing anymore?
Holllllly shit that was lucky
Dammit!!!
Ah fuck, I can't believe you've done this.
[Called it](https://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/7p3r99/game_thread_cfp_ncg_georgia_vs_alabama_8pm_et/dseceb6/)
inb4 Bama goes for two, misses 
You had him going backwards and still gave up the touchdown lmao
How did you let him get it like that?
thats what Georgia gets. when you play not to lose you freaking lose. 
Georgia just needs a field goal 
This is the most Falcons things since the Falcons
Oh fuck, Georgia Curse is playing its hand again.
r/CFB: Riley is ruining Calvin''s draft stockCalvin: Hold my beer
Georgia gonna Georgia
Nick Papagorgio
False start?
go for two
That throw was fucked
It really didnt take a genius to predict this. 
I DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH MY HANSS 
amateur locked his knees
The entire country sighs in disappointment. 
Maybe Georgia will stop playing prevent offense now 
FuckYesCfb
God fucking damnit
Oh snap, sub 4-minute championship on the line
Jesus refs, going to give them any more leeway with that huddle time? Better not start the play clock, and just whistle more.
Blitz the freshman
C U R S E D
Everyone that tried is dead 
Best comment I've seen so far
GEORGIA PLEASENOT AGAINGODDAMNM IT
I'll just keep reminding myself that Saban failed in the NFL. 
The fucking holding
That iPhone kid filming the celebration had a face of intensity like he had been preparing for that moment his whole life
Good job Tua
i have to wake up at 7 tomorrow. pls no overtime
oh shit
oh no
FUCK
4 down with 4 minutes left does nothing for you. Especially considering how well Georgia can run the ball. 
I thought so too.  But it worked out. 
Georgia you fucking fools
What was last national championship to go to OT
Tua is getting his dick sucked tonight
Overtime???
Good teams win. Great teams cover. 
Wow the fuck did who happen
Well that phantom PI screwed Georgia like we expected. 
Looked like nasty hold on the line.
The refs refuse to allow it.
Oh my God. I hate you uga but I wouldn''t wish falcons''ing it on anyone 
WatchESPN makes me want to die
This is the natty we needed
fuuucck
THE ~~HAWAIIAN~~ FRESHMAN!
RIP dawgs
I don't know if I can do another OT game.
Forreal, they act like a freshmen has never played football.
Anyone know what year this taigovaoilajadadsljkfjs guy is?
Somehow
We have had some top notch title games the last several years!
As a neutral fan this thread be funny 
there's another td drive brought to you by the refs
First Altanta then Georgia..... Who's pig did someone from georgia steal for this curse?
Dynasty shall continue.
Welp, Georgia *does* have experience with overtime. 
It just means more.
this has probably been asked a million times is Hurts hurt or did he get benched. sorry for the dumb question.
Vintage Georgia sports here. Choking against the evil empire
The state of georgia really likes to choke
Coaches: “He wasn''t even throwing it to him” truth 
Alabama came back thanks to the officials.
Just drive down and win it here Georgia. 
I''ve seen a ton of comments saying that but I don''t even see a “live” button for me
On the back of blatantly awful calls going against UGA at every turn, but yes. 
Game ball goes to the refs.
Man...Georgia bout to get Oklahoma'd
The state is cursed
Fucking insanity
alright guys block the extra point, end the game
Was there a missed hold there?
Glass houses buddy https://www.columbiamissourian.com/news/missouri-s-adult-obesity-ranking-worsened-in/article_176ee04a-7088-11e6-9dad-1768283581a9.html

Landon Collins I think. 
Georgia just pulled an Oklahoma 
I am first half Alabama, and I have Cable.I am second half Alabama, and my True Freshman neighbor taught me how to pirate Direct TV.
False start on 21 but don't see any calls there
We gotta new game folks
[deleted]
I LOVE HOW HES NOT JALEN
Pls Let''s get OT in the national championship 
I don't even like football
Just wow
Najee Harris false start?
Hahaha, god imagine a shank on that extra point!?
#FUCK
Just like the fucking falcons
Oh dear. It''s a rectum shattering game.
And TOTALLY redeem yourself!!
Fucking shit we're gonna lose this game ain't we?
Touchdown!!!!!!!! The Surprisin' Hawaiian has me surprised. 
Well shit 
How do you not blitz the freshman there?
HE CANT KEEP GETTING AWAY WITH IT
fuck fuck fuck
Think again
Alright Georgia...all you have to do is run the clock down and give it to goggles
Friendship with Georgia over ^^^/s
From 28-3 to 13-0, the tradition passes on for Georgia championship games.
wew that was a false start
Time to answer
Ok Dawgs. Special teams. Block this kick!
Who wants OT?
**TUA DA GAWD**
Just give it to Bama
*weeeerrrreeeee baaaaaaaacccckkk*
/r/cfb going to burn tonight
If bama gets the ball back without Georgia scoring and gets into range, do you think they try for a FG with little to no time on the clock?
Fuck you Alabama
Kirby never blitzed the fucker once
Idk how the qb fit into his pants this morning with those huge balls of his 
fuck my life
Should be 27-20. Thanks Jalen
Are.... Are you rooting for Georgia!?
jalen for sure hurts right now
OT please
So much for going to bed early....
GO FOR TWO
Wooo!Rawl tahd!
It shouldn''t be this close, awful refs
Patriots South at it again. 
can't both teams lose?
UGA in shock. 
ESPN just climaxed.
Unbelievable
How many times is Fowler going to say “spins it” when Tua throws?
Calvin baby <3
They're looking fresh man.
We can never have nice things 
Love the game the Refs are playing tonight for Bama
Holy shit the holding. 
Jalen Hurts career is over 
Did someone say true freshman?
True freshman leads a game tying/winning drive, then the other teams offense comes out with a little time leftFUCK
False start
LETS FUCKING GO!!!!!!!
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
BAMA. Bring on the downvotes 
Well this game is way more interesting than I thought it would be. Officiating has been straight trash, though.
If Bama had missed that xp I'm fairly sure the universe would have imploded in upon itself
Damn if only Hawaii wasn't a state 
OMG!
I''d be fine with OT. No dawg in this fight
Stream freezes right on 4th down.... fuck espn
Man why does ATL love choking so much?
Shades of super bowl 51Edit: 51 not 50 whoops
You better believe Alabama's line held like mofos on that play.
I'm sorry but fuck these refs I'm so fucking salty.
Fuck
ridley finally in the game boys
These two are the BEST OF COLLEGE FOOTBALL
This is gonna be a ride 
T R U E F R E S H M A N
Friendship ended with Jalen. Now Tua is best friend. Jalen was too runny.
Fuck GA for choking and letting Bama win yet again. 
Yeah I saw that after the fact
I legit feel bad for Georgia sports fans. I don't know what they did to deserve this.
That was fucking holding
Tua TagovagonnawiththisgameforBama.
Time to step up goggles
Alabama is playing great right now.That said, these refs should *never* be allowed to officiate a natty ever again
Lol
Bless you
GOD I FUCKING HATE HOW LUCKY BAMA IS. YOU GUYS ARE SO DAMN GOOD BUT YOU ARE ALSO SO DAMN FORTUNATE IN THE MOST CRUCIAL SITUATIONS.
Fade me 
Of course
What was that? 
Wow what a throw what a fucking game
Bama tryna kill everyone's dreams as usual
this game is gonna make me have a nervous breakdown 
Refs tied it up. 
WHAT A PLAY
YEEEEEEEEEWWWWWWW
lol holding
What''s going on with it?
You aren't going to get that call, ridiculous 
What does a FG get them though? A chance to win it sure but it also gives Georgia better field position.
holy fuck this kid is fucking good. even if Bama doesn't do it tonight, they're winning the next two titles with him, Jeudy, and Harris.
TIL: Ala bama is two words.
Lots of time, you can do it Dawgs!
Oh baby
Original
"The superstar receiver [hasn't done anything] all night except for that moment" - Chris Fowler (trying too hard)
HOLYSHITHOLYSHITHOLYSHITHOLYSHITTTTT
boi they bout to do it
And all the shit calls by the refs catch up. 
wow lol. bama not going down
;)
Some big time holding inside lol. Jesus Christ.
Okay, who else was convinced he was going to shank the extra point because Chaos?
Fuck
THats so old. 
crazy throw
lol i called it two hours ago. The refs will bring bama back into it with pass inference calls and no holding calls on bama, and they will take a late lead. I fucking called it 
Fuck. I already had a shitty day, and Bama winning would only make it worse.
Well fuck. 
The stones on Tua. Damn good throw. 
This is Superbowl 51 all over again. Like is there a team less deserving than bama?
I would wish it on Georgia alone
Sorry but wheres Cincinnati in the championship?
Can we please make an exception for Tagovailoa and send him straight to the NFL?
Fromms time to shine now  
ROLL FREAKING TIDE
Well you have to admit a little more is expected from Fromm since he has a lot more game experience but it''s annoying  that they hold the double standards. 
Who saw the professional photographer taking pictures of ridley with his iPhone while his slr hang around his neck? Lol
Dammit.  Not like this....Not like this.   This is Falcons vs. Patriots all over again.
Inb4 "we're set up for a classic here"
FRESH
Come on Georgia, big play now
We're about to experience a singularity everyone! Hold on to your butts!
Fuck I feel conflicted 
ESPN is kill
Its unacceptably bad. 
Bama was on offense on that play punting buddy
Can''t even imagine the Georgia fan-rage right now. 
That is a STUPID throw.Unsighted, between 2 defenders, into narrow space.
**CAN YOU FUCKING NOT?**
Is the stadium having brown outs?!?!?
Georgia has lost this game. They''re just gassed
BOI
At least it's a good game, right?
The only difference being Bama can win playoff games
It's probably not as bad as what's happening on screen tbh
A bunch of whiners.    There have been some iffy calls, but not more than a regular game.
This is a reverse miracle. 
SHITSHITSHITSHITSHITDAMNITSONOFABITCH
God dammit Georgia, you guys are fucking cursed 
That was the most insane holding.
[deleted]
ROLL TIDE
That throw was fucking insane 
I thought Tua was gonna get smacked there. Takes presence of mind to get that off while scrambling, especially as a true freshman in his first (?) game. Holy fuck boys!
FUCK THIS FUCK EVERYTHING
The Bama QB reminds me of me in madden.
Honestly, I was pretty nervous watching that extra point. 
Life has no meaning
Why do Georgia''s dbs fall apart in the redzone?
Ridley me this
[deleted]
That dude tripped and Georgia gets pass interference? 
I see Matt Ryan gave UGA their halftime pep talk 
True Freshman!
I'm having a fucking heart attack 
YOU FUCKERS!BOOOOOO!# BOOOOOO 
pls give georgia glasses kicker a chance to win it
I'M CALLING THE POLICE THIS CAN'T BE LEGAL
Ice
Nice, great use of vowels
fuck :/
Fucking Georgia giving us blue balls this whole time.
So, we're just not gonna call holding on 63?
I have a Georgia choaking fetish
How did he even see that wow 
someone hold me
#OT??
That was a hell of a play by a freshman who hasn't played a ton all year
if i see the hold watching it on my phone, the refs need to see a hold there on the inside of the line lol. WOW
71 with the blatant hold but ok
The amount of holding Bama gets away with is fucking insane. These refs are a disgrace to the BIG
that was an amazing throw.
at least if Alabama wins we can say UCF is National Champions by one poll
Bama paid oDr the refs
Good job Zebras!
The madman actually did it!
oh geeeeeeez
Damn this some Saban voodoo shit 
Georgia should blitz more. They are giving him too much time to throw.
Don''t let this tied game distract you from the fact that the Falcons blew a 25 point lead. 
o shit. we got a game
ROLL FUCKIN TIDE
absolutely
Why do you want me fired
I like the pause - it showed me the 2 missed holds on Bamas oline
WHO WOULD WIN: H8 AND THE DAWGSor one Tropical freshman boi
Amazing halftime adjustment. Genius 
Wow, a Georgia team collapsing in a championship game. I haven't seen that since last year
Woof. Here we go. Georgia had to put something together or it's gonna get dicey
Georgia needs to run this entire series in the wildcat (or whatever). It is unstoppable when they run it and they need to bleed clock and only get in FG range. 
we ain't dead yet kids!!!
What a cool play
Georgia fucking sports. GG Bama
Georgia fans looking like its over--there is a shit ton of time left.
The Dark Prince does not summon himself. Only laughs at those he opposes. Nick Satan...Saban...I support 'Bama. Saban just freaks me the fuck out, though. I think he's pure evil.
I bought a lot of beer cause all I wanted was a good game. Looks like I'm going to get it. 
Flyin'' “Johnny Football” Hawaiian
Long slow drive. Hot Rod. Adiós.
Red and black team blows game. Deja vu
Look at all that holding bro lol
god they held the shit out of that guy
Y'all got anymore of those Ridley brothersScratches neck
We need a long drive to give D a breather and a TD
and in this moment, we are all freshman
OT?
This game has been amazing
Fucking Georgia
RIP DAWGS LIVERS
God damnit Georgia with the epic choke
Hahahahahahaha, Guess the refs really came through, right /r/cfb?
God fucking dammit.  Please do something on offense
Where is the fuck is the holding call?
78 being choked in the middle lmao..
this is the darkest timeline
Hi GeorgiaAre you ready to have your heart broken again?
This games crazy
[removed]
Yeah I understand that. 
fucking lol
THEY CANT KEEP GETTING AWAY WITH IT
Georgia blew a 20-10 lead?
YAY Bad call gives Alabama a tie game! Oh wait, I am not an asshole and think it's shitty as fuck
Where is jalen hurts?
What a choke job by Georgia 
this kills the jalen
Please put this away Georgia.
Fuck me. Fuck Alabama. What the fuck is life?
You have got to be kidding me!!!!
Glad this turned out to be a good game.
Holyshit Tua is the truth
TUA holy shit
Ayyy lmao 
FS??
Anybody else notice the receiver at the bottom of the screen started too early?
Why were they able to do a TD on 4th down
Holy shit that wrap up by 71. How the fuck do you not call that 
holy shiiiit
THIS GAME IS LIIITTT
100% holding on the TD play.
You had one fucking job Georgia.
ESPN INSTANT CLASSIC IN THE MAKING BOYS
Tua Tagovalaiuiadalcicsouoa
J U S T F A D EM EF A M
Nick Saban 
My dog is begging for pets and it is screwing with my redditing ability here. 
How the fuck did he get that ball in there?
How the fuck did he see him
2012 again
Why the fuck has Tua not been the starter all year?
[deleted]
I have to wake up at 5:30, rip me
WHY DOES GOD HATE US
I wonder what this must feel like for Jalen Hurts
I told my dog the Bulldogs were blowing it.  He was sad because he doesn't understand the concepts of sports or television.
Georgia sports gonna Georgia sports
OC's don't even count unless they're in the booth. It's just common sense.It worked-out this time, but still though.
That is a low percentage pass thrown perfectly. 
63 trying to strangle that Georgia defensive lineman.
Holy crap. This second half has been crazy. 
*guy makes PAT*"Ala. Bama."This is what good commentary sounds like, guys
DONT LET GEORGIA COLLAPSING LET YOU FORGET KNOXVILLE WENT 0-8 IN SEC PLAY
The fucking freshman made that throw! Holy shit
They can't keep fucking getting away with this shit
This is just good football.
What a fucking choke job 
MY BODY IS READY
TUGGIN FOR TUA
Each team looking incompetent for a half a piece? 
Can't call on bama
63 holding all day. ouch.
My brain didn't make sense of that live. Took two replays!
is tagovailoa the best football player of all-time?
Fromm better play like 4th quarter comeback Barrett during Penn state if he wants to win this game 
This true freshman has balls of steel
Seriously. I was sure it'd be blown dead 
Now we''re gonna run it up the middle for negative yards. Book it.
DID YOU GUYS KNOW THESE ARE FRESHMEN?!
"Ridley intercepted the ball"-David Cutcliffe 
Falcons 2.0
Yo Jalen come to Blacksburg
And of course the refs miss a hold.
Where are all those who said "this is why you don't put the true freshman qb in..."??? Go dawgs.
What a throw and catch 
Ohio State vs Miami?
Ok Georgia. Soccer it is. 
So..... Where is Hurts gonna transfer to? I mean.. we have beer and cheese...
Wow. 
That might be the most clutch pass I've ever seen in a college football game. 
24 doing absolutely fuck all there 
I'm never gonna see any of my teams win a championship am I?
Hurts doesn''t make that throw.
THERE'S NO RULES
MUH FLAGS
yes
Amen.
Is the Georgia sports meme gonna continue?
Oh, fuck you bama
That play just killed Hurts' future at Alabama
Remember when they called jalen mr. Clutch? 
It''s the 2012 Lsu-Bama game all over again...
So where does Hurts transfer?
YOU SHOULD HAVE 2 HOLDING PENALTIES RIGHT THERE 
Amazing pass
Plenty of time for Georgia to score. Dont be worried Dogs.
That wasn't to Ridley. Lol
Dude c'mon that was the easiest call all game. 
The darkest timeline
What a throw jesus
Hold, hold, hold, hold, hold, hold...
There''s no holding shut the fuck up you whiny ass people damn.
This game is surpassing everything I thought it would be. 
Go for 2! Go for 2!
Fuck me silly I hate Alabama so much 
I thought it was epic as hell it looked like the lights were flickering. Damn this is a game lol
Oh, cool. Thanks ESPN for fucking freezing right as the ball is snapped then un-freezing with the Bama players celebrating. GOod job, you garbage service.
Too uh
I'll take 5
Calvin Ridley refused to be overshadowed by his younger brother
What a fucking throw
REFS FOR ALABAMA MVP. 
Why does this whole game seem familiar? Can't seem to put my finger on it
Getting held?
What a boring game
Georgia you were the chosen one!
My favorite is the guy who deleted his comment not realizing there are two ridleys in this game. 
Let's call it a tie. 3 way split between bama, Georgia, and UCF. 
We are about to get another Alabama title and y'all think that's better than UCF being champs?Just joking everyone!
Seriously Georgia?Fucking seriously?
LG was holding smh
What a hold. Grade A
Thank God he left when he did or else Bama would be going for and probably winning a 3peat.
I cannot believe a QB changes is working
god damnit Georgia is going to blow this...
Fucking 63 with the hold for a minute. 
GEORGIA BLEW A 20-7 LEAD
Was he throwing it to Ridley?
I love this stupid stupid sport
...was that meant for Ridley?
TUA "TOM BRADY" WAKALIAMAGUALOKU 
I did not follow the ball at all right there. 
What a roller coaster of a game man
That throw was incredible. 
would be up if the didn't miss that field goal
Dont really care for any cfb teams but im rooting for alabama because of ernie johnson
Truly remarkable
Georgia baby what is you doin?
THEY CAN'T KEEP GETTING AWAY WITH IT!!
Someone get ESPN some Aveeno to help stroke Bama's dick Jesus christ
20-7 jokes begin......now
Georgia must like going into OT
I get Hurts wasn't playing well, and that Tagovailoa has been playing well (just tied the game), I just don't understand the logic of throwing him in during the national championship after half time. It just doesn't make sense to me but then again I ain't coach.
Big10 refs don''t know what a holding penalty is
Alarm is getting closer....
2 missed holds.
Can you imagine if Tagovailoa played the first half too...
Tua is just impressive
24 gave up on the coverage half way through wow
They're dicks to other fans
Lol this game is far from over chill. Georgia beat fucking Mayfield i still have them 90% chance win
The fuck are you talking about? 
Imagine being a Atlanta Falcons fan and watching this. PTSD
Just remember that throw was made by a 'true freshman' quarterback.  
the broadcasters definitely made a supertrooper bet before the game to see how many times he can say freshman 
Even if alabama loses tua is gonna make life miserable for the sec next year
He got lucky as hell
Insane hold there too. Keep it up refs.
It's because Georgia does not know de way
Fuck I feel so bad for Georgia fans.  Not over yet though
Am I the only one who saw UGA 78 being bearhugged from the side?
who the fuck is this qb
This Tua guy is the fucking real deal.
Was he even trying to throw that to Ridley?
That was luck
F R E S H M A NQ U A R T E R B A C K
I guess the redneck prayer group worked
holy shit 
This game is nuts 
This is one of the best throws i've ever seen. Don't @ me. wtf
I can't stand when Herbie talks about fucking "moxie" lol
DirectTV NOW > WatchESPN
FUCK
I think its all about the Chiefs now
We're not Bama I guess that's why this happens
The refs got the game they were trying to engineer
Osu vs the u
Ha
Lmfao you cant seriously celebrate after your team has 0 holding calls? Lmao garbage 
All hail Saban may his dark reign bring a thousand years of eternal suffering and darkness.
How about the blatant fucking holding on the right guard
Fucking mother goddamn fuck
That was the luckiest shit I've ever seen
fake punt i'm calling it now
Curse of Sherman man
They used up all their luck juice vs OU
I plan on insisting UCF was 2017-18 champs whenever it gets brought up.
That was LUCKY
Unbelievable pass
george u r ruining my sleep schedule 
What a fucking throw.  He threw it into Neverland 
Bama will
I want him.
Fuck that was a throw 
looked like good defense all around.. Tua and Ridley just made the play
Threaded the needle with that pass.  That was nothing short of amazing.
That TD was 100% intended for that other WR, lol.
Just fucking kill me now 
why can't the badgers get a frosh QB to dominate games
He wasn't even targeting Ridley wow
Of course they dont call holding there
I thought so too.
That''s what I''m thinking, but I don''t remember for sure 
I just came. 
I knew this was going to happen
Gerogia sports and choking. Name a better duo
wow.  that window wasn't very big.  clutch throw.
HOLY SHIT I am going to be 10 years older by the time this game is done.
What a fucking throw.
that would've been PI 
If they don't blitz the freshan he will stay fresh
I'm not sure Tua was throwing at Ridley there. I think he might've just been putting it around his receivers lol.
He didn't throw that to ridley
I have no vested interest and don''t see any of which you''re referring to.
I think you mean 51
lmaooooo as a georgia sports fan... not surprised.
Fuck Georgia Sports. Breaking the hearts of even neutrals since time began.
STOP SAYING TRUE FRESHMAN I'M RUNNING OUT OF BOOZE
Plenty of time left as long as play-calling doesn't get too stupid/careless
JFC never seen such bitching about refs before.   
Fucking ridiculous throw. This kid is unreal
That was blatant 
30-13 maybe.
#TUA
HALLELUJAH! HOLY SHIT! WHERE'S THE TYLENOL?
Gonna pause it here so you can see the holding and face mask that weren't called. 
#22 was held big time too. 
100% he was trying to throw to Harris there
I keep saying it, but HOW DOES ALABAMA PULL THESE PLAYS OUT OF THEIR ASS?   That shouldn't have been a catch with so much pressure but somehow...still is.
Lol was he even throwing to Ridley?
That's why Hurts isn't in the game for those wondering earlier.
I really need this to be on a Saturday for optimum drinking game potential. 
That was similar to "The Catch"
A job is a job but snap is life
And their defense also gave up a bunch of points. They had a 3 score lead, which means they lost because somehow the Patriots offense scored several times...
how many fucking penaltys were just missed on that play. A false start, two picks, i mean jesus. 
Falcons fans...I'm sorry 
That Freshman will get so much poon this week
Overtime then Brady leads bama to the Win. 
Throwing rope? This isn't a porno
Announcers a bit too excited
Feels so dirty rooting for Bama, but my Georgia Tech DNA would never allow me to root for the other team...
That was an amazing fucking throw holy shit.
Time for Jake Fromm to win the game here.
He was throwing it to 22. Damn. 
Holy fuck the balls to make that play call and he executes. 
4 min drive + 30 yard field goal from Goggles inc
He wasn't even throwing it to Ridley lmao.
amazing interception by Ridley.
That ball wasn't meant for Ridley
If this ends up like the goddamn super bowl, I... I... Goddamn it. 
Good thing the refs missed all those punches Bama threw
Could''ve called pass interference on who ever was covering Najee Harris 
They're gonna take away Mayfield's Heisman and give it to Tua.
Holding on Bama? 
Wtf is with holding never getting called anymore 
good lord. that was a lazer beam. 
Holy shit that missed hold
Holy shit, what a throw on the run above a defender's outstretched hand and what a catch.Jesus fucking Christ.Tua and Ridley are my new fathers for real.
Fuck ESPN
LOL
63 on bama literally hugging the Georgia player.
I just tore up a shaker in a fit of rage. Now I have to pick up the pieces so my seven month old doesn't eat them. 
$48 says brown is back in again and does something stoooopd
I don't think he meant to throw it to Ridley.
Well, 2 things could end tonight. UGA's championship dreams, and Jalen Hurts' career at Bama.
Georgia whyyyyy
Bring on the OT!
Wow what a great game. 
[deleted]
He was trying to throw to 22. That was lucky
Nick Satan always gettin lucky 
He wasn't throwing to Ridley 
Chaney trying his hardest to lose this game 
lol reddit is so mad
OT?
Add them to the stack
I will. We will be scrong again
yea he went on the clap of the qb not the snap 
Because we live in the worst timeline 
Huh?
STOP REMINDING ME OF THE CHIEFS GAME FUCK CMON 
idk if that was meant for ridley but works for me
Please retire Saban, so I can enjoy college football again. 
things would be so different if the refs didn't fuck up so many times
Go for 2!
It is, my dude
GAH NOWHERE IS SAFE
Bama doesn't hold.
Keep em off your sister.
oh no Georgia what is you doing
Lol he wasn't even throwing to him
Yes, let's all celebrate the "moxy" and "poise" for the QB who had all the time in the world and not the WR running around like a madman trying to get open...
Game will be given to bama in the next two minutes. Watch.
Am I insane or did a WR jump early?
I love all Bama threads.
"back at ya babe" would be right... really, to anything she'd say
Not bad. Hadn't seen that one yet. Just the one from this game. Thanks.
Crazy how many people are calling game when it's tied with plenty of time left
No fucking way that was intentional
I don''t like football 
Auburn gods forgive me for this, but...  *roll tide*
holllllly shit this game
comes down to goggles?
Fuck the refs and fuck this shit game.  Also fuck the comittee.  Bama, aaaaaagaaaaaaaaaaain.  Nobody wants to see this shit.
That was some serious lazy secondary defending. Everyone let their man go lol
You know it
Put this man on suicide watch, keep the WAMbulance on speed dial. 
and in their stadium 
deleted  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.4977  [^^^What ^^^is ^^^this?](https://pastebin.com/FcrFs94k/80690)
That wasn''t even supposed to go to Ridley. Ridley absolutely made that play
Oh wow. Did y'all know this quarterback was a freshman?
Hot take: that was a lucky ass pass
rip east coast people who have to work tomorrow
Georgia is doing an Oklahoma.
Those aren't Dog Collars...
Holy fuck
    "GENIUS MOVE"
From around the 45 yard line perhaps?
Fromm bout to seal himself in CFB history with the greatest ever drive culminating in Saban dropping his pants to reveal the 666 on his ass.
ITS TRUE FRESHMAN ALL THE WAY DOWN 
Holy shit Tua. 
Georgia teams should never have a halftime lead in a football championship game 
Big plays just don't feel the same without a voice crack.
Damn, he was throwing to the other guy.
"That's street ball in downtown Atlanta." My favorite quote of 2018 
They're allowed to hold. 
If you send me a story I'll send you some naked truth
You can get away with many blatant holds as long as you're Bama 
Spare us the Saban dick suck, ESPN
lol
Alabama QB is gonna take off his mask to reveal he was Tom Brady all along
Throw of the Gods
Four dbs right there. That throw took some balls. 
I love seeing the football go into the Allstate hands
9.3/10 on the butthole clenchometer. 
Respect. What a throw.
Current mood: *FUCK*
Kill me 
I'd like to take this opportunity to thank God that I am not the field goal kicker on either of these teams.
If Alabama wins, they get a double asterick.  UCF would be the true NC
Worked for us once hehe
No not with that 2nd flair. Come back for FSU cuddle tho
Several fucky refereeing calls tonight
I would say the false start and then the facemask no calls hurt them more.
I don't even think he was passing to that guy, lol
wow big balls Saban getting rewarde
Georgia knows just because they're playing in the falcon stadium doesn't mean they have to play like them right?
GODDAMNIT GEORIGA
25-2
Ha that one male cheerleader 
I'm happy and dying of PTSD help
How so? Neither QB is being dragged kicking and screaming to a title.
Where all the holds at wtf
Looked like a hold there on one of the OL there. 
At this point might as well crown the Refs champs. The officiating has been terrible on all sides
Can Tua enter the draft?
Pretty blatant hold by 63 on that play 
Watching Tua hurts my soul.  Wanted to be a Duck.  Fuck you Mark Helfrich for refusing to recruit him.
So Hurts has lost his job right?
Officials have sucked this whole game. If I was a Georgia fan I would be fucking pissed.
It's all my fault I told Bama to put Tua in :(
that, and the 7 other calls that have all just happened to keep bama in this
Let the hate flow through you, use it.
He's probably fielding calls for where to transfer
This isn''t fucking okay.I just want 1 game without heart attack.
Benched.
Can someone add up all the blown calls to show how much Georg would and winning by if they got called
We'll beat 'Bama again... some day.
I thought the WR at bottom of screen false started, did anybody else see that or am I wrong?
Lmao if you watch the replay you can that defensive lineman struggle against a hold.
Also, Smart should go to the refs and point out 63 to them so that they can at least watch him holding once
Jalen? Never heard of her
DID ALABAMA JUST GO FOR A PASS ON 4TH DOWN RIGHT AT THE END ZONE AND MAKE IT?!?!
PI on the UGA defender behind Ridley lol
somebody hit me with the gif
And a Scott Frost mask on, just like Sting!
no matter who you're cheering for, Tua has hardly played this entire year, steps into the national championship game against this kind of defense, and DOES THIS LETS FUCKING GO
Can these refs call a single hold? Seriously this is terrible and I'm a neutral!
Oh god Bama flairs are gonna have to go into hiding if we win. UCF instead of UGA is probably the only thing that makes this more of a good vs evil where evil might leave everyone stunned. I'm loving this.
O V E R T I M EVERTIME
Give it away in the 2nd half. Classic Georgia. Fuck.
Alright Dawgs you can still do this
It's cause they're garbage
Refs got you fam
The refs are the ones with their hands around our throats. Can''t do shit against that 
One thing common to both Belichick and Saban are both are flexible to current ideas on offense.  Saban now has a quarterback who would be a dream quarterback for Chip Kelly and is close to being able to run Chip Kelly's offense if he feels like it.
How does the safety not cover that receiver?
Are we just gunna ignore the false start by the RB on that touchdown
Buttcheeks clenched across entire state of Georgia right now.
u got ur dang wish
HAHA the classic "the refs did this"
Did you miss the massive fucking hold they ignored? 
And to think I thought this game was boring an hour ago
Please god stop playing to not lose, we've already choked 10 points away. Get some fucking pressure on that freshman QB and force him to make mistakes
Massive hold, as per usual on a huge play.
Things I hate 1. Bama2. Biased ass Bama Refs
Holding or nahhhh
Clutch
AH GAWD THIS GAME
20 was so damn close to that
Jus think of the story of Nick Saban getting 6 championships and beating bear bryant. What an amazing story line. Storybook championship!
No thread is safe
His future was killed the minute Tua stepped on the field
Yeah, we could've gotten in over you, but we couldn't have gotten in over OSU, so that's the issue
I seriously doubt that was who Tua was passing to
That Tua pass was some NFL accuracy pass holy crap.
I feel like turning the tv off...
https://scontent.ffar1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/26169757_1630781386957089_3145247708398376590_n.jpg?oh=474111bd15031b9870793df170d82c9a&oe=5AB3F5AF
Are you being sarcastic? This is the worst officiated game I have ever seen. 
Last game of the year, Brent.  Can't hold anything back now.
This is some really bad reffing.  63 is holding so badly on the TD.
Aaron Murray talking about how great the SEC is when the entire game has been sloppy. So sloppy, in fact, that the starting Alabama QB had to be benched.
Ok, if we go into overtime, I want the field expanded so UCF can join in. I don't know how it would work but that's not my job, I'm just a dude watching football
Alabama's cheerleaders were really disappointing
Tua + Tide= Scary good...
[deleted]
Nope.  Inside 1 yard to get and you've had respectable red zone success.Statistics are with you there.
That's almost exactly how I'd get a score like that lol.Except I'd spell buttholes or something like it.
My beard was better than that my freshman year of high school 
theres 48 again
OT THREAD
fuck
Sure they can. They are Alabama. 
What do you think is going through Jalen's head right now?
Lol hurts looking for transfer schools
I'm not even sure he was throwing to Ridley
Do people really think that was a bad call? 
Gary did. For all of one quarter.
Get ready 
I know it's 4th down so you gotta just throw it, but that was an incredibly dumb pass that should not have been a TD.
Lol holding
He wasn't even throwing to him! 
let's go Fromm
at least it wasnt a boring bama route. they had to work for it. but you cant stop the inevitable. 
OT FEEDS THE DAWG
This ESPN stream is so bad it's disgusting.
Great throws but damn Bama QBs have all day to throw
GG WP
This is the last game of the year, bama hate aside which I totally understand and have said from day one we didn't deserve to be in the playoffs in my post history, at least it's a good game
I feel a turnover coming.
Good for Hurts for being out there congratulating him
What the fuck is the deal with those flashing lights behind the endzone?
So it begins..
Let's see how tight Georgia is now...
Do we have a OT drinking game?
It's not over until Oprah gives a speech
How the fuck did he pull that off
I want OT! Screw work tomorrow 
RIP Georgia
That was a ridiculously crafty play for a freshman in that situation.Like I guess that's what he's trying to do when he throws dumb ints
Returner for UGA is fast af
Alabama's QB or Georgia?
lol how far behind is your stream dude?
Your d lineman was trying to sell it. Not a hold.
Danny Coale caught the ball
I'm ready for Georgia to completely screw this up
judging by other comments I'm in the minority here but as a neutral fan I'm glad Bama came back to make this come down to the wire. shits way more fun to watch
Bahaha goggles
Redshirt or true? I'm not sure
Best damn lefty qb ever (besides Vick)
Not about to take an L, that's for sure.
Holy hold
UGA heres the setting walkoff and win this at home
I''m fairly certain he wasn''t throwing to Ridley and just got lucky as shit. Was throwing to the WR coming the other direction. 
Noooo please, I need this. Georgia needs this.
mfw I start watching a game as a Georgia born native and the refs catch wind and fuck my team
Guess Alabama had the better freshman QB in the game this whole time 
Drive it down the field and win this game Fromm
No we're a swimming school
Fsu
Idk man, I wonder if there are any freshmen at all in the game 
To be fair there have been some blatantly bad calls.
So where is Hurts transferring to? 
He was definitely throwing it to 22 on that play. Good thing Ridley is an all-american.
Fuck
Georgia with the choke 
Much holding 
I think it was Ohio state v Miami
that's okay because everyone else does. 
Can we please have 48 dude on the field to fuck up things a bit? 
That was a helluva throw. Shit. 
This is fun
tHaT wAs LuCk
Glasses guy gonna make a 70 yard game winning fg
if Georgia loses, the falcons also lose
These kids are true freshmen yall
BAMA. OH BAMA PLEASE DONT GET MY HOPES UP JUST TO DIE
Don't get meme'd, Dawgs
It's do or die now
@ OSU
Every frickin time
duh it's bama
“Doesn''t matter, there''s holding on every play” /s
Luck! He wasn't even passing to Ridley 
I wish Hurts was still in at QB 
that was a hell of a throw
28-3
Bama qb was not aiming for that wide receiver. 
Guys, do you know what year Fromm is?
4th quarter clutch time
Jalen Hurts looks like a great teammate. 
He totally was throwing to the other receiver.
They didn't support the Thrashers
A true freshman. Haven't you heard?
This is about the standard for an Alabama game
True freshman refs. 
I''d cum if the championship game has the same ending as last year 
This is what happens when you play to not lose instead of play to win.
I've never produced this much sweat in my entire life.
Wow how did he see that
Refs giving it to Bama. 
Why does this shit ALWAYS happen to us?
UGA don''t worry, UCF already won the Natty
The falcons and the bulldogs back to back chokes 
1 and done
Saw it
You're peaking too soon.  
I don't have a DAWG in the fight (lol), but I am so entertained by how much you all hate Alabama. Good grief. 
Imagine Hurts right now.. his whole future is in question
No worries GeorgiaJust run that play right up the middle. You know, the one that worked that one series until Alabama made the adjustment. /s
Cut my life into pieces
Mckenzie Milton said Tua should start during the Auburn game
\#63: Giving him the business
Im just numb now tbh
Definitely meant for the guy in the back of the EZ
Yeah you right
Another classic national title game. Seems like just about all of them in recent years end up great games.
I actually want to die. "Hey, u/WillyBarts aren't you happy about winning the Iron Bowl?? We beat Bama!" Yeah it sure is freaking great to win the Iron Bowl and then *watch them win the natty*
I''m feeling a pick. I hope I''m wrong though 
What a fucking hold on that td
Georgia fans, have faith. Lot of time left to respond.
JAKE FROMM WOULDNT HAVE IT ANY OTHER WAY
GOD IS DEAD AND ALABAMA KILLED HIM
They're gonna Andy fucking Reid this game. God Dammit.
Man Jalen is being a hero over there.  Dudes mature as fuck
Lmao
One of those already has 
He won''t retire, he''ll die
What the fuck
QB change after halftime. Reason I heard was to give the offense a spark 
oh my holding on 63
TUA FOR STARTER 2018
Anybody want to just go ahead and name UCF champs to spite Bama?
Fuck you Michigan if you jinx this 
Your first football game huh?
I seem to remember another Georgia based football team choking in a championship game. Hmm...
Admittedly as a 3rd party fan, this game is better than I thought it would be at the end of the first half. 
I don't think he was throwing for him. No way he saw him and 22 was sitting there. 
I guess UGA has to put in Eason. 
The T R U E  F R E S H M A N  can do it
We need this to go into OT.   I live in MST so no problem.
I feel like Georgia has failed to break some crucial tackles.
[deleted]
Was that pass intended for #22?
Conspiracy Theory: ESPN made Saban start Hurts so the game would be close and the ratings would be higher
I CANNOT
Bama is a bunch of crumb snatchers. 
Tua "Baker Mayfield" Tagovailoa
I'm pretty sure he had that last third down tackle.
Georgia playing too soft off on both offense and defense. Stopped throwing altogether
Wow, that was a 2-handed hold on the TD
I''m completely spent. I feel like the Dawgs are too and that there''s nothing we can do about it. But we''ll see.
so umm....jawjuh....plz?
bAmA dIdNt DeSeRvE tO bE iN
I *know*
for real what the fuck
I can say true freshman as good as anyone. ESPN when do I start?
Sooooo...we just not calling holding tonight then, or?
The difference is really night day between the two Bama QB's lmao
That pass was not meant for Ridley...
Get that OT Game Thread ready, mods
Sorry about your loss. 
Benched.
They won''t 
It''s Atlanta is known for choking. If you catch my drift  
What a throw. 
Let's see if Georgia will just run it 3 straight times and punt it again lol
Didn't OSU-Miami go in 02?
#DILLY DILLY!!!
No more RB at QB.
Pretty sure they''ve given up calling holding on Bama. 63 was holding for all he was worth
Oh no!  The refs left someone wide open in the endzone with the game on the line!Georgia, please just drive down, run out the clock, and kick a field goal.
New drinking game: take a drink of beer every time you refresh and see people bitching about the officials... you'll have alcohol poisoning before the games over.
Gotta drive the ball! 
Buckle up yall, we got a brand new game with only 4 minutes to go.
I don't think he saw Ridley
2003 Fiesta Bowl Ohio State 31 - 24 Miami
Hey Georgia, we did it first in this stadium. Stop stealing our thunder.
I hate Alabama but I can't even comprehend how much UGA fans must hate Alabama. Like holy shit.  Win this one dawgs.  People may actually die of heartbreak. Lives are on the line.
That was a damn good throw!
Georgia is going to "Atlanta" this, aren't they?
Atlanta will burn tonight5
Yup. Good hustle by that guy though. 
Dibs
benched 
What uncalled penalties will go Bama's way this drive?
SAM DARNOLD HAS BAMA RIGHT WHERE HE WANTS THEM 
Blankenship game winning field goal. Calling it now.
Well, that's not good.  Georgia has just stopped playing offense this quarter.
I''m so happy to have tailgated this game (even tho I didn''t have tickets)
RB
This is really happening.
Anyone notice he didn''t throw the ball to Ridley? 
I really hate Alabama. But Atlanta choking in the super bowl and then Georgia choking in the national championship the very next year would be funny. 
LEAD US TO THE FROMMISE LAND
MFW it'll be 23-20 and not 24-21
Well I''ve never seen this guy, can''t pronounce his name, but he is rather talented.
In the past calendar year the state of Georgia has blown a combined 48-13 lead in football championship games
Pacific time = best time
He honestly might go first round if he did...
Have you been stuck down by lightning yet?
your username speaks to me
I'm pretty sure that pass wasn't intended for Ridley but Ridley kept going and made the play
Respek to Hurts for being a team player first to congratulate Tua and not being pouty
"Grew up hunting"omg CARSON WENTZ = FROMM
Alabama is the Empire. Every time you think you've beaten them they have another Death Star.
"Either way I win!"
Nah, i just know how it works and called it two hours ago. Bama will win right here.
GOD DAMNIT GEORGIAyou fucking let them off the hook
So fucked up that fucking Bama gets all the calls. They don't need it and it makes this shit to watch. 
I hate CFB right now
I can't believe how little faith Georgia fans have. This is the exact script of a game that ends with UGA winning on a last second field goal by mothafucking Hot Rod
***Updated Mathematical Score Prediction***Georgia 21.35865 - 21.35865 Alabama
Weak PI call leads to tying touchdown. Why am I not surprised?
Game of the century of the year! Let's do it!
I can''t believe you''ve done this. 
People Georgia is not choking. Only thing choking is the refs on bamas dick.
Why did it take this long for Tua to start lol 
NCAA 2005 Update: This is beyond ridiculous. More special teams miscues for my Gators as they fumbled a punt return to give the ball away for the 4th time in the first half. Arkansas ball at the Gators 32 yard line with 2:57 to go in the first half
Why dont they allocate some speed towards other people besides the georgia returner
I know 
"I'm never starting a CFB game again"
Don't let Bama win again 
Meteor is gonna win this one I think
I want the Saints to draft Tua in 3 years, and then exhume Buddy Diliberto and reanimate him just so I can listen to him try to pronounce his name.
Can UGA do it when it counts? Did last week.
MY HEAD AND MY HEART WTF IS THIS GAME THERES STILL OVER 3 MINUTES LEFT I DONT EVEN KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH MY HANDS
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1Wrx6eQZ1E
Like...mormons?
No
??
Is holding even a penalty anymore? My fucking God these fucking refs
Is it just me or was that an obvious false start by the guy on the bottom
Do refs get mvp if bama wins?
This is when Fromm can become a legend
It all comes down to this.
C'mon, I'm wearing my lucky shirt
Yeah I know it blows my mind that I kept saying if they put Tua in this game, this game becomes different and sad thing is I had to be right 
Most people here on campus are also rooting for Bama, don''t feel badEdit: but never speak those words again
Damn look at that RG holding hardcore
WE NEED TO FIND SABAN'S HORCRUXES
Congrats to Alabama for winning the 2017 national championship 
Stop being cute with your calls, Georgia. 
Does Bama''s kicker put it on the 1 yard line every time so they have to return it? In both play off games he''s consistently gotten the ball inside the 3 yard line
Eh D held the tight end there too, they've been letting them play all game
He's played. These aren't his first snaps. But. Not in situations like this no doubt. 
Agreed
"you think Lane needs a QB next year?"
This unknown Bama team is really something!
lol, no he wasn't.
Freshfromm the truth about to march them down the field.
OT baby, cuz this game ain''t long enough
fuck everything please just give me one damn win just one
Come one Georgia don't blow another lead
yo, get Michel in the game
Only military.
Just because he''s Hawaiian doesn''t mean he''s perfect for chip Kelly okay 
Ya but I think BB would bench a player for assaulting a coach lol

This QB looks like Russell Wilson out here. Respect.
Looks like he was throwing to 22... now way he could see 3
13-0...3-1Golden State blew a 3-1 leadUGA is doomed
Kill the clock and get a field goal. DONT LET BAMA LUCK INTO ANOTHER NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP WIN
If it wasn''t for the missed calls...
Ask any Bama fan, they knew Tua would work 
wide receiver 
Does Alabama not get called for holding?
You can blame the refs all you want but if Georgia loses this is on the coaches.  Shitty play calling since the third quarter going away from your QB and just running. 
Aw fuk bye 
Georgia still gonna win this game
Tua was throwing to no. 22. He got pretty lucky
Gratz refs. Now let them play please.
Gotta be up at 6 fml. 
I saw that too brother
Missed a big crazy hold by #63 but that catch was clean af
Tua's pocket presence makes me think of a left handed Russel Wilson. Seriously impressive. 
Hope he leads us Tua win.  Get it?
"What about the moxie"Oh, I didn't realize we were in 1925 talking about Vaudeville. 
He was trying to see if he needed to keep the double on Ridley, or jump a pass to the crossing TE. 
No, the one who went in motion def looked like he started early 
Jake "Literally Tom Brady now" Fromm
Can someone phonetic this dudes name,  sounds like the announcers have a seizure every time they say it
No way he was targeting that WR.
TUA the legend. Hurts: NFL dreams may be vanishing as we watch.
holy fuck. i don't even know if he knew who he was throwing to. 
Back to back years with big game winning drives vs Bama? Maybe?
Freezes just as the ball is snapped then un-freezes when they're celebrating. 
This is my last resort
No
.. 
The second I thought it wouldn't shit the bed it cut out and said "Loading" twice
Yeah have any gone since then? 
The playoff committee calls down to the refs: "we want overtime."
Pretty sure he was throwing it to the other guy and got lucky... haha
ATLANTA CURSE
Alright Bama you got this this is all you come on lets go
Wtf is this shit just make it slightly easier on UGA for fucks sake we need a non chaos game for once Missed face masks and butt interceptions are all bullshit
So much time left
I think Georgia's best bet is to run the clock down and take the field goal
FALSE START HOLY SHIT
How do puppies stay so soft?
Haha, agreed.  Why I left.
Why would you ever start Jalen Hurts in the first place if you see this in practice
So when are ref gonna get their rings fitted?
The only thing that would make this game better would be a light/power outage like that one Super Bowl a few years ago
Plenty of time left for Georgia to get into FG range to nail a GW kick.
Freshman Bowl is getting interesting.
i'd prefer overtime
Did you go to UGA? 
Georgia cannot handle this loss. The memes will be forever.
"jake fromm is born for these kinds of moments"*drops mouth guard as he comes onto the field*
That's one of the best throws I've seen today
C'mon fromm game winning drive pls
Pretty sure OU scored using that same play...scramble and all. 
WR on the left looked offsides. But this is more exciting as someone without a vested interest in this game lolEdit - meant false start, my bad. Looked ahead of line of scrimmage. 
I may have heard coconut oil works better 
Nope.  Throwing to the guy in the back.  He never saw Ridley. 
It's UGA's championship dreams, isn't it?
Everything about this game has been garbage since the blocked punt got called back. If bama wins they better give the refs the MVP trophy
Fromm wouldn't have it any other way
heart rate 9000 fam
If Bama wins this game I guarantee there won't be a single article on officiating 
I don't think he meant to do that.
But that 1 game is the championship lmao
Tua 2020
Playoffs were spectacular this year too. 
I hate this guy on Homers calling touchdowns “tutties.”
the fucking vision for that throw.
Tua making his own luck out there
They haven''t said tua''s name one I swear
I just can''t believe the number of missed calls against Georgia in this game.  I''m a homer, but this was always going to be a close game, and the refs and held us back.
Did we just watch a murder on live television holy shit that block
This isn''t fucking okay.I just want 1 game without heart attack.
No more fucking wild-dog or whatever the fuck please.
T R U E F R E S H M A N
Jake Fromm State Farm 
It's obviously the narrative that's been being played out
Prediction: This game will not go into OT
time for Fromm to cement himself in Georgia legacy and lead them to the ship
Did the QB even see the receiver who caught the ball? seemed like he was going to the guy who was behind. Either way, that was an incredibly athletic throw.
***HERE LIES JALEN HURTS HOPES AND DREAMS***
DID YOU KNOW NICK SABAN WAS ONCE A TRUE FRESHMAN!?!?!TRUE FREMSHEN!!!
So many fucking holds
Thank God "true freshman" is not a drinking rule 
Lol that''s kind of concerning. “I''ve never felt uncomfortable in my life.” Sure thing, psycho.
If that wasn't caught, there was a PI in the endzone anyway.
NOT AGAIN!!!
I didn't believe the Georgia sports curse...but you know what they say: "people don't think it always be like it is, but it do."
RIP someone
ESPN Films presents; 30 for 30: The Battle for Atlanta A former pupil returns to battle his teacher on the greatest stage in their sport.  Starring; Gary Oldman as Kirby Smart. Gerard Butler as Nick Saban. Steve Buscemi as Jalen Hurts and The Rock as Tua Tagovailoa. 
Fromm v tua next year too please. 
There is no way on this earth Georgia will win. It's over
For some reason, chromecasting it from my phone to the TV has been significantly better than watching on my laptop/through HDMI or on the PS4 (both of which are hardwired). Shit is weird yo
Nope (as in you are correct), he was going for 22.
You didn't get the memo? The refs aren't calling penalties tonight
Do you think he was trying to throw to Ridley right there?
Let's Gooooo Dawgs
> Jake Fromm, born for these kinds of momentsaka Jake Fromm wouldn't have it any other way
Where legends are made lets go Fromm
Guess they didn''t want to call that obvious hold on Georgia on that touchdown throw
its Hurts ill tell you that
'I should go to the #thefaU'
Trust me, BIG officials don''t call holds against Ohio S...I mean Alabama 
Tie ball game. Tie ball game, we have all the time in the world. Its your game Fromm, march us down this field. If you don't believe in something, pretend for us here Dawgnation, pray to something here. We need a miracle here boys... Write us some history tonight offense. First and 80
Don''t let Georgia blowing a 13 point lead distract you from the falcons blowing a 25 point lead
That was an amazing throw.
I don't know if I can handle OT
I never understand this shit... pro announcers for every sport say similar things about rookies too.  Its always somethings players should know by high school, especially elite players
There is no luck, we're not auburn, there is only the process
3 and out on 3 runs up the middle and I'll snap
Soooo. Georgia.. gonna throw this series or just roll over for your daddy?
Put in number 1 Michel
lol Fromm, this isnt OU's defense
Oh my god that was a fucking prayer. Dude is lucky as shit 
Can you say Sam Darnold?
Falcons vs Patriots.  That''s what I''m watching right now.
Who would winAn elite SEC defenseOr one Khaki boi
What if saban has been grooming this qb all year as his secret weapon for the national championship game? 4d chess
I'll get the tin foil. I'm actually starting to believe it
There''s been some questionable calls... bama has taken some cheap shots that weren''t called that probably should have been. 
Holy cow I'm not good at noticing holding calls live but that was pretty blatant. 
jake fromm pls
Wasn't even aiming for that receiver
Alright Bama D. Hold out one more time.
The refs wouldn't have it any other way
No kidding. Pure luck as he missed his intended target. Those plays happen though.
Alabama''s oline will. 
First thing I noticed. Officiating has been awful.
I think so
Why act like middle schoolers then?
Oh what a surprise, Bama getting away with bullshit on top of bullshit....like being in the playoffs to begin with.  Smh. 
Just woke up for my night shift job someone fill me in.  Especially on the reason why jalen hurts isn''t playing 
Bama pls
BAH GAWD THATS HUNTER RENFROW'S MUSIC
NICK SABAN IS ACTUALLY BILL BELICHECK IN DISGUISE
Inb4 refs call holding this drive. 
I can't do this shit y'all 
Must hurt a lot 
This thread right nowhttps://youtu.be/3KquFZYi6L0
My heart needs the rest
Not a chance 
He is texting Kifffin on the sly. 
Oh Georgia's QB has been a prodigy his whole life? Yeah so has every player on the field in their community 
Wow. 
You n me both, bud.
Boo I''m trynna see some action.
Fromm throws the pick to lose 
Nick Saban's fucking stone cold face after that touchdown
State Farm needs to sign Jake Fromm 
A Nick Saban coached Alabama team has *NCAA 14* levels of bullshit rubberband AI. 
Wow. Just wow. 
and.... Alabama won the game, lets see
Use the Force, Jake!
Wait, what? He's  a true freshman? This is the first I've heard of this.
Do you fill your pools with the tears of your most passionate fans?
that was actually a perfect throw.. WTF
I think Hurts has lost his starting job going into next season
But can you say that he isn't Deshaun Watson?
Bama' s QB seems to be adjusting to life in America pretty well
Georgia driving too fast and kicking a field goal, leaving Alabama enough time to drive for a touchdown would be peak Georgia sports IMO
No way he was trying to go to Ridley.
This thread is cancer. Y''all are so painfully biased
Out of the last 5 only 1 has been bad (2014)
The memes would be glorious
I should have paid attention in class.
Been going on all game. Refs handing everything to Bama. BS PI extended that drive too
but will he stay true?
Georgia will blow this. Either with an INT here, or a loss in overtime. They will definitely blow this though.
holy fucking hold, dude had him in a chokehold
Nick Saban is drinking two cups of hot cocoa tonight.
TAGOVAILOA IS MY NEW GOD
Only a 9.3?
I''m so fucking glad I''m not an Auburn fan
come on Dawgs, let's go baby
There hasn't been a bad natty in a while but I have seen multiple bad Superbowls in the past few year 
Never understood why teams start playing not to lose instead of sticking to their guns. 
**I FUCKING LOVE COLLEGE FOOTBALL**
Oh, NOW you want to throw it?
Adam, I love you, but this was NOT the game we were looking for, and Aaron, shut the hell up about the SEC.
anybody happen to know whats jalen hurts record as a starter?
Georgia can''t choke this, right?
FROMM WOULDN'T HAVE ITANYOTHERWAY
Immense class and maturity shown by hurts. Good guy 
Tua and Fromm will meet again in the NFL i guarantee 
georgia is going to lose aren't they
"That weather down in Boca Raton gonna be real nice"
Alcohol poisoning is generous. They would be dead.
Titty sprinkles 
#ATLANTA SPORTS CURSE
Like a good neighbor Jake Fromm is there 
0 to 0 baby. Let's play ball.
Come on Bama, I really don't one of our rivals to win the Natty two years in a row.
My god I would love to see Wisconsin play either of these teams. It would have happened too if they hadn''t choked their one big game of the year.
Did you not watch the rose bowl?
No but the refs are.
Fromm has never felt “uncomfortable” in his life? I''ll invite him to my next family''s Thanksgiving
Dawgs is kill
#thefaU
Waterboy quote lol?
That's a weird way to spell "blowing the refs"
Absolutely, such a fucking lucky play.
That what I thought he was trying to do
If the blown blocked punt call and the stupid INT that was off a player''s helmet decide this game, I don''t really know what I''m gonna do.
Switched over to Coaches Film Room for the 4th quarter. Strips out the emotion of the crowd/game but love the chess match commentary.
What a game!
Let''s get some defense, Bama!
Chiefs were up 21-3 and ran the ball 5 more times with the regular season rushing leader.
I wish I could believe that. 
Saved this comment for future abuse. 
Bama quarterback got a wikipedia page sometime in the 3rd quartercongrats
If I was a Bama fan I'd be yelling ROLL TIDE at the top of my lungs right now...where all teh Bama boys at?!?!?!
Thank you. I'm surprised they didn't mention that. 
Roof is already leaking, just gotta have the water hit the right wiring that leads to the lights 
I hate this game. I want both teams to lose.But it's such a good game.  Exciting close game, where I want both teams to lose.This is why I drink. 
63 had that man hooked so bad I could see it 2 rooms away.  Id be ashamed to be an alabama fan 
I love how Hurts is being a man about getting benched. Great character on him.
Johnny Tsunami!!
Will an impartial third party tell me if these refs are ass or not?
Pls Bama make r/cfb a saltmine
fumble, calling it now
fite me irl
Boy if they lose this.. Going to have to put a Warning: Choking hazard label on the state of GA.
Bama doesn't hold.. ever..
20-7, actually
If Georia loses this, the memes will be through the roof.
Fucking georgia teams choking
It doesn't matter now but did anyone see the Georgia DB start the tackle on the receiver in the back of the endzone as the ball was being thrown
It will be
His hand slid along the face mask, never gripped it. Go back and watch the replay 
damn that must suck for him :(. Hurts has never been a super start but I guess you have to anything to win
So Jalen Hurts is not starting a meaningful game for Bama again barring a Tua injury right?
"Fromm has never felt uncomfortable in any situation in his life" is about to become the new "he wouldn't have it any other way" isn't it
Im loving the lack of commercials 
Bought Hulu just before the game started for 39.99/month. Worth it even if this is the only thing I watch this month.
And Fromm throws a pick in 3...2....
It's in their contract. If the player is a true freshman, they are legally bound to announce it each time.
He had a shitty 1st half
Fine by me
alabama has literally held the entire game with the same two offensive linemen. Literally the same two guys LOOOOL you can't make this shit up 
If both Bama and the Pats win this year I'll be pretty upset 
Having 94 and 99 on the d line isn't fair
Who said this?
experience which in this case is not worth more
He's never felt uncomfortable in his lifeLol
So glad I could care less who wins this game, some of yinz tho are on the verge of a mental breakdown.
That''s not really a hot take 
Yeah that last angle made it look like it was going to Harris.
"fuck"
INT - Field goal - Eng game (not Taylor''s version) - Bama win
This is the problem with Bama. No matter how the game's going, it always feels like they're still gonna win. Georgia was up 20-7 and I don't think anyone felt comfortable that Georgia was gonna win.
Refs with the small assist.
whoops
QUICK GEORGIA PUT IN A WALK ON WHITE GUY
[deleted]
Great game. I'm just glad that win or lose there is such a huge focus on this. I'm just happy that 2 rival schools have to spend scholarships on people who don't give a shit about college in order to get concussions and then get shunned in later life when they get taken advantage of and spend their 40s and beyond uneducated and  physically/mentally broken. This last 5 minutes is what football is all about. Go dawgs!!!!
Not with that attitude it aint
The enemy of my enemy is my... dawg? My hatred for Alabama transcends all rivalries.
Georgia is currently doing Georgia things.
Fromm is a trash quarterback, he's not doing anything with this drive 
TAAG-OH-MY-LO-AH
Georgia has a fever and the only cure is more whiledawg
Nick saban switches to a 'True Freshman' what a genius. GOAT, o baby.  Did I mention TRUE MOTHERFUCKING FRESHMAN!!!!!
woof
They werent up that big. 
Hurts career is already over win or lose imo
I don't think that was his intended receiver.
Anyone see that massive hold by the Baja right guard 
i was wondering that too .. wonder if he mouthed off to coach at half. 
Not a chance, Ridley should get an INT as well as a TD there.
75 half a hold himself. Have they bothered to call one yet?
He''s not good 
Calling it. Georgia goes 3 and out. Bama wins on last second field goal. 
Georgia has been fucked by the refs at every turn tonight. I'd be *livid* if I were a Bulldogs fan. Holy fuck.
hiding some corpses under his patio
Love it...this is the game winning drive.
yes, got lucky. wouldve been interference thugh
Thought I saw the same. 
Yep. A cool second before the ball was snapped. Right in front of the line judge
Oh shutup bitch I have fiber internet and the ESPN stream is garbage. YoutubeTV has no issues, though. 
Idk but it shore wuz purty
He never had NFL hopes lol
Aw man that''s the worst. Did you try the streams for it?
Whos 94 for Bama that the coaches room keeps going crazy for? Dudes a beast
Holy fuck that was such an obvious hold but this is the national championship so refs swallow their whistles. What a fucking joke. I'ma neutral and i'm furios
I have no idea how he saw to make that throw
Most likely 
don't do this to my old sad heart
I just remembered I have left over pulled pork mac and cheese. #Blessed
I believe in you UGA, let's go!
Will Saban regret starting Hurts all year?  What did he see in Hurts anyways?  All I saw was a really shitty passer holding Alabama back...
I WANT OT SOOOOOOO BAD
Who was it that said Saban sacrificed some people to satan for a better game?
UGA with the ball and 4 minutes. Yours to lose now. But plz do good and defeat the legion of evil
no way
no facemask there?
Georgia does understand they don't get to play 'Bama again in a couple of weeks, right?
I have to wake up at 0545 and I'm on eastern time
Sick and fucking tired of bad officiating deciding games.  It's like the NFL tonight.
Najee had a false start before that TD?
Landon Collins so hyped he can't even talk on the Homers stream.  Takes off with the mic to high five guys.
Was just thinking that
Say congratulations?
This is how I felt at last year's superbowl. Atlanta needs more mental health counselors. 
Come on Georgia
But can he speak the language yet?
First day back on campus in Orlando for me...classes straight through from 9-415 or some shit. All 4000lvl history classes. Long day ahead 
he played an awful first half.
/r/cfb would explode
They never called it in our games. Why call it now?
What is an asterick? 
Once again Saban proving why he's a coaching genius making the switch at halftime to the true frosh at QB
are there any true freshman playing? they should really mention it if there are.
If they don't get this 3rd down Bama wins 
and holding on Bama, but the refs didn't seem to be looking for penalties that play.
https://i.imgur.com/NQjgc89.gif
God help our DBs...Help them not play like our DBs... 
alright bama def lets get it
If you can''t call 63 for holding on that Bama TD I don''t even know what holding is
If Cardale Jones Jr. leads Bama to a win here that would be the most Evil Empire shit ever
"I was going to be a professional fisherman, but my fallback is NFL quarterback."
These refs are bullshit. We all see it
Lets go Dawg bros
It's the exact same game.
Won''t count a win until we''re ahead and there''s zeros on the board. 
I'm going to feel bad for Georgia if they can't win this one. There have been bad calls on both sides, but the bull dogs really got the shaft on some big, possession changing plays.
Bama has all the momentum. Thank god i'm not a Dawgs fan, I would probably be having a melt down. Physically and mentally.
just like the rain.
i know right? georgia is holding on almost every pass play!
no doubt for me.  he's done a great job of leading his receivers.
3:39, we've got all day, almost too long. 
I don't know why that didn't get any play. I thought I was taking crazy pills.
[MFW the game is tied](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DTErpGaWkAAjWuI.jpg)
My night shift is about to start. WRAP IT UP GEORGIA. 
They've gotta call one run play this drive, right?
These commentators are fucked
Fromm wouldn''t want it any other way
Shut up, shut up, SHUT UP!
To the two most hated teams on football nonetheless
Not since the last SEC game, Alabama/LSU
Georgia got cute with chubb and the wildcat. 
Big Boy pick six incoming 
I'm glad I don't care who wins. This is gonna be a rough night for some of you.
relatable
Either way, that was a high IQ throw. He threw it to the only soft spot.
What''s up with the salt in this thread? 
Jalen Hurts struggled mightily on first half.
I believe the man has earned a little fellatio
They are indeed ass
I was a male cheerleader in high school.
I haven't been passing out hot takes all night, man.
The blocked punt should''ve been a false start and a re kick. Either way, no block
Kind of our thing
Just awful. Sorry. 
~~you~~ WEGonSmellLikeBoozeEdit: formatting
If he stays I could see him more at RB
Over under is 44.5, damn Vegas is good 
Georgia choking
and wr. These refs are the worst
He will transfer to some other school like Texas tech or something
That''s a pretty good summary of the whole game
I''ll be so mad if the team that tolerates players punching coaches wins this game.
go with crossers over the middle free up someone
YESSSSSSSS
Agreed, he was throwing to that other guy coming in from the left, can't remember the number. Good thing Ridley saw it.
Don't you have someone's oil to check?
REALLY important play coming.
Even the spots are awful for Georgia
any good streams?
Or 25-2. 
Bama has gotten away with a lot of calls
Andy Reid calling plays for the Dawgs
Robbed by refs. 
Agreed. This ends in the next 3 minutes.
Georgia was up 20-7. Hurts is out because he couldn't make passes. 
This checks out
don''t let this distract you from the fact that #48 mekhi brown will be the #1 pick in the XFL draft
They can''t pronounce his last name. Probably weren''t prepared for the QB switch. 
I mean I wanted Bama to win but I will feel so bad for the state of Georgia if the Bulldogs blow this lead.
hurts wasn't effective. they needed tua for his passing capabilities
All of a sudden we have no replays? 
It was fun while it lasted
I'm not from Havard, but I think this play is pretty important
Alabama is going to win in regulation.
They ran out after the first half
Unbelievable how much shit is going for Bama, so one-sided
Fuck bama and their no call advantages
Phantom? Why now...
Nice 
Based on refreshing Google, Georgia if they can actually do anything is in a great, like perfect position 
Kind of wish you were. 
The next Wilson vs A rod
We did it last week. Against UGA. If anyone knows, it's them. I don't get the complacency
Interception or Field Goal?
FREE CHUBB
Yeah, I smell a transfer for sure.
you mean lead this ship right into the beach?
Just got benchedBecause of course, it turned out Alabama had _another_ National Championship tier QB just sitting on the sideline
Georgia seeing what happens when you play not to lose instead of playing to win.
If Georgia loses, the Falcon and Bulldog memes will be too much 
Bleacher Report is trying to be so hip and with the times
The chances of Bama being called for holding on 4th down in a natty to nullify a TD are 0%. Bama's line played like it.
Theyre gonna go long
I'm kinda glad they front-loaded them. 
Facemask?
It''s the moment I''ve been dreading all game. Georgia is going to choke. 
So happy I don't have a dog in this fight. No pun intended.
If they dont make this first down its fucking over. Georgia defense has been gassed
finally overcame that language barrier
How can it be a classic after that blocked punt got called back. It flipped the whole game on a terrible call.
Goggles kicker gonna win the game?
Turning this off. 
Put Hurts in at tailback next drive.
If georgia loses I think it's because Mark Richt laid a curse on the bulldogs by rooting for them.
Come on Georgia!
yes
I am nervous 
He couldn''t throw the ball, this new kid can. Second half dynamics have made this game.
I was listening to the saint''s broadcast of the game the other night and the one analyst wasn''t doing too good a job with names either lol 
I hate it when teams have a lead and take their foot of the gas
Please get to goggles range
Memes never die
Your flair. It brings out the worst in people 
Delete your account
Can we get the kick six part 2 here 
I'm in DC and definitely not close.  Can't remember seeing any in VA.  NC probably the closest one.
Quick guess: how many times have you heard "true freshman" tonight?
Alabama - "Do you know de way" Georgia - "No"Alabama - "Spit on the fake SEC queen." 
Game is way too long. 
There was a 0% chance that was meant for Ridley. That was a contested throw to two defenders and the outside receiver. Incredible luck bama
ESPN LOVES SUCKING ALABAMA COCK
Tonight is the first night my Sling TV asked me if I was still watching.
Calhoun's?
Georgia fans might burn down the Benz if they lose.
Time for them to catch it three yards short as time expires
pay no mind to the 2 offensive holds protecting him
T U A F R E S H M A N
That fella was really ballin the jack
Uh... yes? Had a few too many tonight?False start isn't a declinable penalty and would have blown the play dead, negating the blocked punt. Not calling the false start is just as incorrect as calling the offsides. What you're asking for is a bad call, just the other way. You don't want good officiating, you want Georgia to get the help that you think Bama is getting. Meanwhile, people who actually want good officiating understand that the outcome of the play is basically the same as if they'd actually called it correctly. Bama didn't get unfair help there.
Uh ooooh
savage lmao
Would you say there's been a pattern or is it just garden-variety, sloppy officiating?
Jake Baby what is you doing...
no no no no no FUCK 
plus the very obvious hold on 63.
Calling it now. Kick 6 2.0
Can we have more commercials please? It's been awhile. 
That was a mistake
So that was just a terrible pass to #22 in the endzone?
Looked like he was staring down #3 the whole way, even before he escaped the pocket. He knew that he'd be coming open as soon as the ball got there.
Fuck bama
that's rough to be benched in his biggest game ever :(. But if you're not producing it's smart to switch.
Come on Fromm fuck
Game. Unless UGA goes for it
SEC SEC
Man Fromm is fucking terrible.
Because You were winning and you had this hiding in your back pocket for  A moment just like this
Yeah, smart play Imo if it stops a TD.
lmao they're gonna do it huh
That was bad.
Wow. 
UGA pls. 
I don't think there is gonna be an Athens after today
and then they put him back in!!  he made a tackle on a kick return 5 mins later
Agree.  I think it was meant for 22.
Sling > watch espn
Fucking bama
What a god awful pass. 
Maybe Jalen will transfer to Texas.
No why
Let's just be grateful that Clemsux isn't playing in this game.I can finally enjoy a close national championship game without shitting bricks.
He got tired, so he gave the ring of power to Samwise [Hawaiian name].
Fake punt u fucks
UGA wut in the heck r u doin
Choke job by Fromm
Refs gave us a bad spot, 3rd and 3 Dawgs. Here you go
> This is why I drink.Username checks out.
Yeah wtf the hooks and face masks are bullshit man they keep missing calls for us and it's actually a bit silly. Wildly different game if they make the right calls earlier 
Hahahahaha.
Time to transfer Jalen, it''s Tua Time
Games over
Georgia fans you aren't crazy. The refs really are out to fuck you. Kirby should just tell his oline to start blatantly holding to see how biased these refs are.
shit throw, choke city
This is a football game!
Fuuuuccckkkkk
Man that throw
Sheeeit
Ah god damn Georgia don''t give Tuabdhwosngehwlakshehwisj another chance
Not sure if Bamas QB actually meant to hit the receiver he did. It looked like the receiver in the back was the target and the other player jumped in. Or am I crazy?
Fromm not clutch :(
Fromm are you fucking serious
You gotta punt this, right?
cam Newton throw 
Oh no
Georgia better be careful. They need to run it. They are about to give it to Bama for a game winning drive chance
They havent called one holding call. Alabama has unlimited holding its garbage football
Payne. He had an interception and a TD reception in the semi-final. He''s awesome
Jake Fromm wouldn't have it any other way
This is not a good timeline 
And that''s all, folks 
TERRIBLE. FUCKING. CALL.
#BAMA
I want to die and also kill everything.
GEORGIA WUT IS YOU DOING
Overtime: Sponsored by Buffalo Wild Wings
Sad is that they are B1G refs
You called it incorrectly
ESPN 30 for 30: Dead Frosh Walking
What is this play calling Georgia?
Fromm, bby, what is u doin'?
That was the face of a man who has seen this before
That was a terrible throw 
Bama backup has ignited the team. Took over at half. 
Cause your sucky ass team is only in it because of the refs 
Its like its scripted
You know what? Fuck this. I'm not watching the rest of this bullshit. See y'all next year.
Fromm... bruh.
Fuck
Oh man it''s happening isn''t it 
This is the most Georgia thing ever
Nah, Bama doesn't commit penalties. Haven't you realized that?
fire up chips baby
Lol I like your style
How did he miss that throw??
They can''t pass
TRUE FRESHMAN
It would have only been false start on the punt if it makes you feel better. 
You have to be blind to not see every call going Bama's way
OH GOD THE CHOKES
Awful fucking throw
My heart is some kind of super heated plasma or something idk it''s football
Georgia's freshman blinks first
This is over
Oh God noooo
What the hell was that throw?
What are you doing Fromm 
Georgia is pulling an OSU and refusing to feed their star rb's
No Michel or Chubb? Ok...
Nope, they haven''t 
Damn...Fromm blew it
Where all the boring game comments?
Run the fucking ball
Don't win games with frows like that.
Oh man, that was nerves nerves nerves
So Alabama wins.
Awful throw
Cheers mate!
Complete choke by GA. 
I absolutely cannot believe the shit I am watching right now.
is this really going to happen
Did somebody say FRESHMAN????
Oh shit Tua is getting the ball back...
HAND IT OFF FUCK
welp
Fuck Fromm...
bruh
Fromm is cracking.
Anybody know what Jalen Hurts record as a starter is? 
Jesus Christ. What a choke. Bama has this now 
Wtf was that throw 
Payne is beasting.
Fromm is choking fuuuuck
Fromm is playing atrocious
I really hope so
wait why didn't helfrich recruit him??
Yeah I think Alabama might have some Freshman wide receivers also. 
R I P U G AIPUGA
Fromm choking hard
Bamas last drive: HOLD HOLD HOLD HOLD HOLD DPI HOLD TD
There have been some high quality surrender cobras tonight.
Bama gonna score and win. Rip Georgia.
what in the actual fuck
I don't believe what I'm seeing
There is no benevolent god.
Continuous holding and personal fouls that aren't getting called. Then a bullshit call against us for interference.  
gg
What the fuck is UGA doing? Why is Sonny not out there on 3rd down?
Damn it Georgia, you are blowing this
This is ridiculous
Fatboy pick six for the win would solidify this fucking shit season of CFB
no thanks 
Me too
Damn that''s the game. Some BS 
Game. Can''t believe it.
Cmon Georgia 
Shiiiiiit throw lmao
I mean Alabama gave up a lot of uncharacteristic 3rd & Long, including an 80 yard bomb. 
NO! I need to go to sleep!
They ass kissing Bama
2014 (Ohio State v Oregon) in my memory was pretty boring
Idk, I think he was trying to throw to the receiver on the left and got kind of lucky.. We'll never know!
We all know what's going to happen
His 2 worst passes of the night come at the worst possible fucking time....damnit man. damnit. damnit. 
Fuck you Chaney. Cost us the game. 
Way to go Georgia. You fucking blew it.
jake "blake bortles" fromm
That wildcat crap is what cost Georgia this game
This is such a horrible choke job
God dammit they''re going to win 
No OT  tonight
Hey, welcome to the club
This is going to end exactly how we all think it's gonna end unfortunately.
Like Brady overthrowing Welker
Wow.
Wow, Georgia. 
Don't fuck this up Georgia 
Hahaha oh UGA what you doing baby
HES CHOKING!
what is happening
I'm sure he could still get a job as a QB for the Browns.
omfg
If only Georgia had two beastly running backs...
Georgia, you learned nothing from Atlanta. 
My fucking heartburn. 
you have no idea
no
No shit you fuck stick. I blatantly called the call correct but disagreed with the rule. Did you intentionally misread my post or are you just trying to be belligerent?
RUN THE FOOTBALL ANDY REID!!
Georgia is SHOOK
If you refer to "freshman" as "frosh" you need to turn in your Man Card
3 and out was not what you needed right now. Bama in control right now. 
Well, goodnight everybody.
Boi is going straight to the UFC bro 
Salty? 
We're fucking cursed
That was a choke throw 
Holy fuck jake fromm sucks ass
Can''t give it back to em go for it
perfect left enough time on the clock for Alabama to win the game
I am from the future and Alabama won.
They needed one more TD before going into clock killing mode. 
Jalen wasn't doing anything productive so they brought in the freshman to start 2nd half
The Buffalo Wild Wings championship game 
We know how this ends now. Congrats Bama.Must get boring winning so much. 
lel Georgia gonna blow it?
That's game. Bama has all the momentum.
I feel like we need to cue the music. 
That''s game. Fromm has been barely off all night.
Lol the qb
UGA, why do you have to blow this? Come on. 
Fromm bad to worse.
Fucking bama
Sure, Georgia is choking... but they should be choking with a 10 point lead right now.
Saban....uh, finds a way
Run the ball Georgia!
Foamy
Lol
NICK SABAN IS A STABLE GENIUS
Was switching out the QB ballsier than the 2010 onside in the SB?
THOSE GEORGIA FANS LOOK SAD
I don't like this.
The only thing that will make this night better is to see some young freshman choke
FUUUUUUUUUCK
Cobras out
Uh-oh
Why not give Sony the ball right there? Hes almost a guaranteed 7+ yards.
not if it will help UGA....
69,420 times
This is the only way 
I concur. 
Fo sho
This game was so exiting I forgot to drink!
Fucking choking. Where was Michel? They're pulling an oklahoma
NICK SABAN:  GOAT!!!! 
Also incredible no calls and picked up flags too
All Bama needed was a questionable overturned blocked punt, a GA QB throwing a fluke pass off the helmet of a lineman moving perpendicular to the line, an overturned interception by GA in the endzone, and a fourth down play by the Bama QB who was aiming at a different fucking receiver. Just whatever you do after this game, do not credit Saban for any of that. 
Fromm has not been very accurate this whole game 
I have Georgia +3.5 and this is concerning 
He had a first down staring right at him and just missed
Can't wait to see the youtube video of this game where they speed the game up every time the word "freshman" is said
Holy shit true freshman fucking up.  Didn't think that was a thing anymore.
alabama DBs love grabbin helmets
This is really threw first time I felt the refs cost the game.
Game over 
Alright Bama. Keep it simple, keep it clean, and get it done
73763637393
25-2
Yeah to the wrong guy
Alabama fans steer clear of this sub lol
UCF going to storm the field any second now. 
At this point I just want it to end in regulation. I''ve got an early alarm
**CHOKING INTENSIFIES**
Too many
The holds are pretty bad but punching a guy in the face and shoving fromms head down is unexcusable.
fuck fuck fuck
Jake Fromm wouldn''t know it any oda wey 
We all know where this is going... disgusting lol
Georgia is really gonna choke this game away!
Oh no 
Where are the ACC refs? Bring them back. Big ten get your shit out of here
Damn bring on the downvotes!!! The salt is fueling 
I'll counter. Georgia puntAlabama turnoverGA wins on last second fg
Im laighing
Lol free pass inference calls and lack of holding calls gave them the momentum they needed. Good game boys enjoy your win Alabama. 
If bama wins I don't know if people will be happy because of the UGA/Falcons memes or salty because of Bama winning, I'm going to guess both. 
ballgame
That''s it. Game over. Fuckin hell..................
Bama please don''t score on the next drive, we want OT!
Tua has this in the bag 
Lotsa Dawgs doin' the SURRENDER COBRA!
You can't go three and out in that situation. My god UGA wtf are you guys doing 
Tua = Vince Young ?
Evilest timeline
The blocked punt wouldnt have stood anyway, because a false start is a dead ball penalty.
Got away with multiple holds too
Overthrowing the ball in a critical moment :(
I mean yeah, that wasn't great, but I wonder what Georgia has done that hasn't been caught by a camera. Should have been called though.
Eternity left on the clock. Enough for UGA to go 3 and out and Bama to get it back and get a TD to win it and me to blow my brains out because I took UGA to cover and the under with my loan money.
Fromm butthole clinch .. 
False news.
Fucking clockwork
God fucking damnit Bama is gonna win. I'm so fucking sick of watching Bama win.
God dammit Georgia
That's weird, did anyone notice that two receivers on Bama and Georgia have the same last name? Are they related or something?
Mark Richt loving this
Fuck Bama, Drown Tide
These refs are the best defense Bama has had in decades.
How do you miss that throw? Bama is gonna win again are they?
Fromm wouldn't want it any other way. 
Muffed punt time
If we win this game I will shave a reverse mohawk into my hair and post photo proof. No bamboozle.
T0WATCH FOR A FAKE
Us last weekend after half
Didn't do so well in first half. Freshmen QB for Alabama came in 2nd half. Lot of controversial comments on here like holding etc. Alabama is coming back from like a 20-7 lead
45-2
You must have Ebola to know de wey
Extremely. Must be awkward to be an announcer when they keep replaying the play with it clearly visible in the middle of the screen.
Fromm, I think his name is? The UGA QB lol
3 yards to goyou have chubb and michel.you throw it.too much cute shit from UGA.  that lost them this game
FALCONS ALCONS
GG
The darkest timeline
Called it, didn't I 
"Hunting and Fishing was always Fromm's first love."Yeah, because it's fucking recreation. That's like saying "going on a cruise was always his first love" or "staying in nice hotels was always his first love."
99 can have my children
Hand it to Michel for fucks sake. I cannot believe Bama's going to win this game 
Bama's gonna win. Ofc they are
ridley is a beast though. but you are right
Don't do that, no one knows what will happen
in front of the line judge
That feels like the game
That drive was a little too big for Fromm.
These UGA fans have me lol
I mean..Georgia..3 throws..whut u thnkin bb
if it is your first year starting you are just not going to beat alabama. its not happening. unless you are the GOAT cardale jones
I love how there were no Bama fans to be found in quarters 1 through 3... now look at them all. LMAO
You just left Michel and Chubb out on that drive? Are you fucking insane? 
Amazing what happens when the Bama offense takes up some clock. UGA offense gets out of rhythm. The Bama D gets some rest.
I have to be honest with you all. After watching Clemson's shitty performance in the Sugar Bowl, I did not want to watch this game at all. It honestly represents everything a true Clemson fan hates. I have to say, though, I am so glad I watched it. What a game. 
Don't forget the missed face mask that would've prevented a touchdown drive 
As someone who wishes that both teams could lose, this game has been insanely lopsided in the way it was reffed. I question the objectivity of the crew. Amazing title game though.
We need a miracle 
Man, Fromm did me dirty.I really thought he was taking them down the field.
#S. E. C.
Fromm come on man 
Dear lord baby jesus. Pray for the dawgs tonight on this lovely January evening.
That''s game
3 and out baby lets gooooooooooooooo
Why would Saban sacrifice to himself?
*clicking intensifies*
And another team is going to choke it away and Bama is going to win yet another championship. This shit is so stupid.
Watching this game makes me appreciate how good we have it in the NFL when it comes to QB play.
Damn it Bama''s gonna win.
they got kinda boned by some no-calls
To yall, yeah. 
This ESPN stream has made this game almost unbearable to watch, and I pay for cable...
Put Eason in!
[deleted]
Look at the bright side, no matter what happens this will not be the biggest collapse in Georgia sports history.
Game over. They can switch the programming over to Wheel of Fortune
It's spiders Georg(ia), the outlier who must not be counted
What the fuck was that Fromm?
Georgia offense completely shitting the bed the last couple drives with sloppy play and play calling the drive before
I hate everything
Bama gonna win it looks like.
Notlikethis.gif
Saban had to sacrifice more than his soul....
Now it''s on Georgia''s defense Time for Roquan to show us why he''s the best linebacker in America 
He should go ahead and change positions. He's not making it to the NFL as a QB. I'm not sure if he can make it as anything else, but he'd be better off trying at Bama than transferring somewhere else.
Sam Darnold wouldn't have it any other way.
MY BUTTHOLE CAN ONLY BE SO TIGHT
Why so much salt?
25-2
I''m beginning to think Georgia is a cursed place when it comes to football. 
Georgia fans I''m so sorry guys. 
Georgia blowing it hard
I know it''s not over, but does anybody think Alabama isn''t gonna finish this off and win it?
I wonder how the refs will affect this drive
We're going to never hear the end of this. Get me out of this timeline. What the fuck did you do Barry.
RIP Georgia.
Think they said 22-2 earlier. 
There's a video on YouTube chronicling Reed's failure of  career up to the other night. It's fantastic.
Take a guess
Y'all got any more of that first half Jake Fromm?
run the ball here: third & three.
I have seen this movie before 
ROLL MOTHERFUCKIN TIDE
It's called prevent defense for a reason, it prevents winning.
I totally agree. Tua got bailed out. 
UGA chocking on its bone. 
Of course, FUCKING GEORGIA SPORTS TEAMS. WHY CAN'T WE HAVE NICE SHIT ONCE???!!!!!
Georgia fucked
Does Georgia's OC want to start looking for a new job or what? Jeebus this has been some horrible playcalling the last few drives.
UGA just lost with that throw.
"You know how OU blew their lead against us last week?""Sure.""Let's do that."
When will teams learn to stop playing so conservatively when they have a lead??? I swear this happens like 75% of the time.
Dawgs are going to win this game with a defensive score.
Get. Out.
Nah I want to like him, don't do that.
'We scrong den' -Tua, probably
Come on Tua I've got Bama -4.5
Lol no way
Your big man INT game is too strong 
Does Hurts stick around at Bama if Tua gets the job next year?
I need Georgia''s kicker to chuck his glasses to the side just before drilling the game winning kick. 
this is so stupid
Haven't heard about it.
He does not hav ebola
Blame the refs all you want, Georgia's playcalling the last 3 series has been terrible
Wow, refs certainly haven't helped but Georgia really doesn't look like they want to win this 
Bama stays being Bama
You're killing me dawgs. 
3rd and 3 why wouldn't you give it to sony??
Can't wait for urinatingtree to do a legacy of failure video on Georgia.
Or you know, 3 and out.
THEY CANT GET AWAY WITH THIS!
Oh boy it's happening isn't it.. 
This is where the Falcons play, right?
3rd and long: We're fucked3rd and short: okay we got this
All hail Emperor Saban!!
Because you made it here on name alone. You didn't deserve a playoff spot....you're the rich kid that got a drives an Audi because your dad owned the fucking dealership 
Oklahoma making it would have been the dream.  Only team in the final 4 I'd have been comfortable rooting for. 
Like a dog choking on a Dentastix
This is a repeat of last years Super Bowl. Georgia team choking against a dynasty
They should go for two
Come on Georgia !!
This is going to overtime isn''t it?
I imagine he starts playing another position.
K.
Tua about to win it right here and become a hero. 
Does Georgia kno de wey?
Georgia blew their load earlier this game.  They're out of gas now.
we all know how this ends.bama kills all the time and wins the gamefuck
Why is everyone acting like Georgia already lost?    EDIT: Got it guys !
Georgia deserves to lose with this conservative ass play calling in the 4th
Fuck, this is really good field position for Alabama.
Fromm????????? =(
How does college overtime differ from nfl overtime?
Total luck
There hasn't been a flag in ages 
Thats game.
GG refs. 
Punting?  Basically just gave the game away.
Stopped by my parents'' house and saw them watching them the game. They were streaming on their Roku, and it was shitty, like you described. 1 or 2 plays then a black screen with “loading”, and it''d resume in the middle of a play. Super annoying and frustrating.
Fromm's accuracy on passes in the flats has been horrendous all day.
I don''t have a good feeling about this possession for the dawgs
I feel a Bama turnover in my gut
\#choke
So how was the incompletion actually the refs'' fault? Anyone?
Sure Georgia, don't run the ball, your strength, on your most important drive of the game where you are trying to both score and grind clock
Tua's face crosses are gone. He mean business now. 
Just a colossal meltdown.One for the ages. 
We've all seen this story before
Just kill me now 
TAKE A KNEE BAMA YOU WONT 
Watching Georgia give this away is giving me flashbacks
Tua heres the setting work your magic
RIP
Why don''t you watch it on cable then?
Wish we had that first field goal...
Lol just as Fowler said something GA overpunts the D and Diggs nearly makes a huge play.
People will bitch about the refs, but Georgia has done nothing to deserve a championship since scoring that last TD.
Jalen Hurts: Hey coach, still here.
o no fromm what is u doin
It won''t even be the biggest for UGA against bama!
I expect the flag to come out 90% of the time when they do that.
There were plenty, what?
Cracked
#MEANINGFUL SNAPS
Bama's about to screw us right ?
Damn you Georgia
Field goal to win...
yup game over
I really thought the curse was over with the Georgia dome going down. 
I''m not a Bama or Georgia fan but why make such a dickish comment? The refs have outright blatantly cheated in your team''s favor, of course people are a little bit upset about this fact
Are you ready for the ESPN pundit Saban suck off contest?
The saddest thing is hurts has to know he sucks after watching his replacement 
They should fake punt...Bama is probably setting up a return
Oh fuck, Georgia awoken the Alabama monster at halftime and there's nothing that can be stopped.
Please eat this clock and score
You're not. There's no way that he knew that tiny opening would be there at that exact moment. He's looked good, but not THAT good. He was totally going for the receiver behind him.
Watch his head... he followed Calvin the entire way 
Because we''re used to this shit 
**TAKE A SHOT EVERY TIME KIRK HERBSTREIT SAYS  T R U E  F R E S H M A N**
Lots of surrender cobras by UGA fans here...
Might just as well punt the trophy over to bama right there 
YOU ARE BLOWING IT...FUCKING BLOWING IT!!!!!
This has to be the worst setup for the ending of this game.
Nah, this is nothing out of the ordinary...
This game is gonna come down to the Alabama kicker, isn''t it?
I'm feeling OT
Big stop Ga.
I'm not neutral, but officiating has definitely favored the Tide
Georgia shouldn''t have shut it''s offense down and started running out the clock for the 4th
I feel for you Georgia fans. Thought you guys had this the whole game till right now. Reminds me when penn State lost to Ohio State 
Fuck alabama
It's over, 'Bama about to win. Maybe Nebraska will save us all.
can't wait to see how the refs help Bama drive into field goal range 
I don't wanna say too early, but I think that shit drive lost them the game, unless the defense really steps up here.
Team Chaos showing its ass right now and I''m loving it!
Let''s go Tua!
Subscribe.
Yes
I didn't know the refs let some random backup QB comeback against them
...Alabama's gonna run down the field and win the game with under a minute left, aren't they?Why are all the exiting narratives and teams squashed by Alabama year after year?  Why can't we have nice things?
Put in jalen. Fuck it yolo mode saban
inb4 crazy long TD play or pick 6
This is bad
Rare miss from Fromm there
bold strategy
Falcons fans are so triggered right now. 
God's not a Georgia fan 
Nope. You're right.
ESPN is so ready to get on their knees for Saban
Oh Georgia bb what is you doing
Georgia's offense can't do shit now
Holy shit Georgia. Wtf. Here we goo. 
jesus that shouldn't be a difficult first down
Now we have a fucking game.
Pick six for the win. Calling it. 
Oh fuck this
Not one single run on that drive. You have the best rb dou RUN THE FUCKING BALL 
69
Sounds about right 
Book it
Georgia shoulda put Stafford in
Holy mother of choking, Georgia!
I feel so bad for Georgia fans lmao
Georgia...the new Auburn. Way to let the whole sub down!
#thefaU
Hell yeah 20-20 you can do it Georgia 
Seriously. If you had someone unfamiliar with the sport watch this game after providing them with adequate backstory, they'd think that this was Vince McMahon's latest venture.
I had 24-20 Bama. Hot damn.
Whoever loses will have 20 20 hindsight 
If Bama wins this I'm going to pretend UCF really are the 2017 Champs
Tua "Literally Tom Brady" Tagovaiola with the chance to lead a national championship winning drive...
Poor Georgia. 
pick 6 or a fumble, I believe in you Georgia Defense
Georgia "Atlanta Falcons" Bulldogs
Stop it. I''m a falcons fan. And that fucking hurts
Fromm overthrew an easy first down. 
oh wow it's just like when MSST blew the game against bama
Fromm hadn't thrown a pass in 2 seriesCan't shut your freshman qb out like that then start throwing again 
Yes they can :(
we know
Bc they''ve watched Georgia sports 
Georgia +160 :(And I fucking knew to grab the Bama over at half. Goddammit.
If Saban is smart he won't leave a minute on the clock like he did last year
in the aaaaarms oooof the aaangels
kms
UGA had to wait until this game to collapse...
Dawgs need to blitz that frosh
just have to laugh and shake your head at this point, what a fucking joke
27-20 Bama. Final. Tua marches here. 
Lol Penn State fan that was at the Rose Bowl. Can confirm.
Guess you can do whatever you want if you were an Alabama uniform.
Not like this. Not like this....
Damn Fromm just BURNED through that chance
Damnit UGA, you were the chosen one. 
Can''t forget that language barrier Kirk 
Eh maybe not, Tom wasn't from the Georgia based team that blew a 4th quarter lead in the championship game ;)
better hope for OT
FG win by Bama, you''re still good tho. OT would prob not be good.
Hey kindly go duck yourself thanks 
I swear the spelling of his name changes every time I look at his jersey. 
Well this doesnt bode well for my Falcons
Football is a stupid sport.
How to win: Step 1. pay off refs and espn. Step 2.??? Step 3. Profit
Pure evil
Don't disrespect the GOAT like that 
That overthrow will cost Georgia the championship 
that series just lost the game for Georgia imo..you have to burn some clock there and run the ball a bit or come up with better playcalls
Falcons aren't the only chokers, huh?
Alabama is so unreasonably good 
choking hard
If bama wins will the bama fans in the stadium be chanting "SEC...West, SEC...WEST"
I feel a collective sense of dread from r/cfb right now. 
Where's my Dr. Pepper commercials? Why are they going right back to Football?
Jalen stop listening to the coaches. Get back to your bench. 
Agree
The most one sided I've ever seen
"We have two of the best running backs in the country. What should we run?""Let's go with passing plays, boss.""Fucking genius, let's do it"
Georgia fans starting to look like Falcons fans last year lol. 
Cmon georgia get your shit together. 
Georgia sports curse,don't you,fucking dare...
Don't bring pressure Georgia that four man rush been working so well
Damn. UGA just can't move the ball.
Stone colds theme 
Tim Beck is UGAs OC?
Fromm is choking 
NO MEANINGFUL SNAPS  ALL SEASON LONG
Rookie mistake is a popular saying for a reason. 
Why was clock running if receiver was out of bounds on second down 
My thoughts exactly. Gotta keep aggressive in today''s play style.
There it is.
4:45 am central for me
By the goddamn refs. I didn't know they were part of the game, can we fucking tackle them as Bama players? Pieces of shit. 
There's a shortage because they all watch(ed) football too...
classy Jalen Hurts
Bama about to win no ot
“Fuck parity” - NCAA 
I've never been this vicariously nervous for one player... come on Tua!
no, however I *can* tell you that his freshman status is true
Georgia losing the game for the same reason they got into it. You can't play "not to lose" against elite teams. 
Georgia is sending out Sam darnold next series. This is exactly where he wants em.
Gotta sit in a different spot or something now dammit 
Tfw illegal streams have better quality 
Sports*
Freshman
I LOVE STAYING UP LATE WHEN I HAVE CLASS IN THE MORNING LETS HAVE 8 OVERTIMES
I so badly want Georgia to win this but can you imagine being a Falcons and Bulldogs fan if Alabama pulls off the comeback?
Any chance Kirby has more freshman QBs up his sleeve...
Fuck. When I have to pee, the one time they don't take a time out 
Georgia fam, is this going to hurt worse than the Super Bowl?
Georgia... clean it up, or I'm going to bed
choke alert
Please don't let bama win. I had to deal with the pats come back bullshit 
Trick play
You saw that kid drop for no reason.
I KNOW RIGHT?!?!?! GOOD TO SEE YOU TOO!!!
Suddenly everyone seems to have forgotten that this game was built on nearly a half dozen bad calls/no calls that gave bama all their momentum...
So many surrender cobras from UGA fans lmao
We are gonna lose this game aren't we. Between the no calls and our OC decided today he was going to regress back to his bad playcalling. Amazing. Fucking Georgia sports
Fromm with the non-True Freshman throw.  
The whole first three quarters:  Alabama fans crying how its over and they wasted the season.All the fourth: Georgia fans crying they're gunna blow it.
Could we see a turnover here?
The true freshman may do it!
Because the momentum has swung 
No. 
Tua about to show out
Wow. He's still looking for his dorm. He is THAT FRESH.
Good lord I feel like I''ve done an 8 ball of coke right now. Whoever pulls this out, it''s been one hell of a game
Fuck alabama 
Not yet, I''ll get back to you if I survive the night 
TIE GAME MEANS UCF IS CROWNED CHAMPIONS LET IT BE KNOWN
good ol' prevent offenseCoaches will never fucking learn
Kirby should have stayed a defensive coordinator with that shit ass play calling in the 2nd half.
Sports* 
I literally read your sentence, replaced Bama with Patriots, and it makes sense in the NFL.
:/
Same, if Bama wins by 3 I'm gonna be so pissed
Update: 11/10
Reports of Bama's death have been greatly exaggerated
20-7 doesn't sound as good as 28-3 but man, Georgia fans will never hear the end of it if they lose
"a year ago he was still learning English" 
Georgia should be going for it :\
NFL is a superior product, although not always as entertainingly ridiculous 
Definitely looked it there!
The last 10 years of watching Bama.
Hadn't throw a pass in multiple series
Hot take: Bama gets a TD quick, leaving Georgia just enough time to go down and tie
[deleted]
Shit throw
If that's how Georgia's gonna operate with three minutes left, who cares what the refs do? Terrible.
Then why are you streaming it?
Alabama has got this. Georgia is thinking too much about the fact they've blown the lead instead of just playing football.
See I already mental prepared myself for this to happen.  I will be fine tomorrow.
3 and out with 3 minutes to go is not a winning game plan.
Folks got class in the morning...end it Bama!
Oof, these young kids fresh outta college aren't ready for NFL play.
Georgiaing doesn't have the same ring to it as Clemsoning. 
Where''s your flair? 
I swear, if Georgia loses this year after Falcons blew the lead last year...
Jesus Christ Georgia wtf
Fuck that, should've gone for it 
Fuck me.
You'll run the clock out and get this one instead 
This is the most tense third place game I've ever seen 
Damn that offsides on the blocked punt and the missed face mask call are gonna haunt the Georgia fans.
I kinda want Georgia to win... But I dont want to listen to my sister complain 
Ok defense.....ok, stiffen up here Dawgs. *Hunker. Down!*
    MOMENTUM    O     M    E    N    T    U    M
ITS ALL YOU BUDDY, I BELIEVE IN YOU
*chocking... ironic.
25-2 iirc from what the commentator said
Darth Saban is going to win this. Sigh.
cant imagine moving from hawaii to alabama 
The House always wins...
Roll Tide!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
Please let a fumble happen this drive.
God damn Alabama
Which one of you fuckers hit the OT button at Buffalo Wild Wings?
Three and out, and they only burned 45 seconds?  Oh no, here comes the throw
So where is hurts transferring to after this?
HOLD THE DOOR GEORGIA 
So many surrender cobras.
Coach Chaney sucks 
Refs gonna end this is regulation. 
Football sucks
Fuck fuck Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck
YES
Frosty boi
Imagine having to hang your championship hopes on the shoulders of Papa Nasty...
A pick-six would be awfully nice for Georgia fans right now.
If you bet Georgia +4 this is a lot more frustrating than it should be. 
Can Georgia also put in their 2nd QB?
Just be glad they can spell.
Idk why this is being downvoted. It's entirely possible
If anything Jalen Hurts is showing he has great character 
THIS IS THE DARKEST TIMELINE
Hurns is one hell of a guy, way to be there for the guy taking your job 
It's like watching the Chiefs, only this time, I'm rooting for the Chiefs. 
NONONONO WHY WOULD YOU PUNT
Whoever calls Georgia's offensive plays should quit win or lose
Is that kid who passed out OK?
can''t wait for the OSU fans to complain until next year when Bama wins this.“That should''ve been US!”
I don't want to see all the UCF bullshit if bama wins....Georgia pls
Fromm doesn't deserve to win this game if he can't make *that* throw...
Not working now huh
why the hell wasnt tua starting before
Go stagnant for a couple series to wind down the clock, stay stagnant when it matters. 
Kick Six incoming
GA has not had a pass rush lately. Please change that. 
wait till you go back and see #22 went early on the touchdown
100% agree with you.
Refs already handed it to them, doubt they need more help.  Fuck this shit.
[deleted]
[[Boston College vs Alabama]]
please don't put this on Papa Nasty's back...
O/U on the under the table ref money? It's all SEC so it definitely means more
Because we've seen this game before from Bama.
You know that break they needed? The refs gave it to em 
Classic Georgia.. if only you had a stud RB. Keep throwing though, idiot coaches.
Ever since Alabama got Cardale Jones'd they've been waiting for this moment. TUA TIME IS HERE
wait is tua the guy that the bama forum fan was worried about having to speak english before the season?
They done guys. All hail bama and their top notch recruiting and Superior coaching I guess.
Oh my god this stream sucks. I can barely watch a single play without it buffering.
great run stop
I pretty much kissed that money goodbye. Now I have hope again!
Dear god please spare us the dick sucking that would follow a Bama title with a true freshman QB
Well. I am 10000% sure that Andy Reid IS coaching Georgia. 
COME ON DAWGS
great tackle
Saban playing 5d chess allowing himself to be down for most of the game
PRAY FOR TUA BAMA FANS
lookin like a true freshman
If I had a nickel for every time I heard the word freshman in this game
The curse of Georgia sports is real.
Duck!
Bound for OT.
Georgia needs a freshman mistake right here
I agree
Between the state of Georgia's affinity for choking and every fucking referees love for Alabama we should have known this was coming 
What the hell with the ridiculous play calling?  Overcommit to the run or overcommit to the pass.Idiot.  
High five your son for having sideline views of every game as part of a highly selective college club that promotes being jacked and fucking hotties.
Not a good look at all
Damn, I forgot Alabama missed a field goal already.
As much as I hate Alabama, watching these Georgia fans slowly realize it''s slipping away is really awesome. 
Georgia gave it their all...
Calling it now: Bama by a field goal.  
This game has got me screaming at my TV and heart racing!! Need Larry Culpepper for some laughs and drinks!! 
I like how now that Bama''s winning, suddenly the officiating got a whole lot worse in the eyes of r/cfb 
Is he a freshman? Is he?
Let the memes begin?
God hates Georgia football the last couple years huh 
Roquan needs a pick 6
So where is the talk about Tua Transferring out and he will never beat out Hurt now?
Different calls if different situation.
Let's see if that "whoever has the better punter wins" article from earlier today turns out to be true.
TUAAAA TIMEE!!!
FAU
Credit to saban for trusting this kid. Holy shit 
Can we just go to OT. I think we all want a bit more college football
Damn. This sucks again, one year later. 
Hurts is good people.
How do you not run the ball at all there? 
At least the INT was UGAs fault... Not that BS blocked punt call.
Sad upvote
Everything changed from the block punt called back
Me thinks the freshman will turn it over 
Fuck nick saban 
UGA D will have to save the day.
Anus clench engage 
Yo Georgia.... life comes at you fast lol
Boom 2 more stops 
I don''t know about you, but I blame the Patriots. 
Be real. No one pays off the refs. 
Jalen Hurts is a fucking bro. So humble. 
Anyone else watching on SEC network the ‘film room''Pretty cool
I hope this doesn't come down to a fg. 
OT pls.  Don't want this season to end.
Sure looked uncomfortable there...
Put Hurts in. The ultimate confusion
I believed in you UGA
I hope Jalen Hurts has Chip Kelly on speed dial 
We choked. Against a fucking freshman that haven''t played a meaningful down this season. This is so fucking Georgia, I don''t have words.
what's the next flag they'll throw against UGA?  i'm going with defensive holding
I grew up watching the Braves win the NLCS in 91, 92, 95, 96, and 99 - and only winning the WS in 95.This feels par for the course for Georgia sports.
He's just thinking where he's going to transfer to
Georgia Tech
let's go Dawgs
Instant classic. 
rb
Bliss to piss
Pls no 
Y'all give up faith too early. Alabama hasn't scored yet 
*CHOKE CHOKE CHOKE*
[deleted]
They fresh out
Ya'll got any more of those Freshman
Well, time to watch some tv, fall asleep, and wait for months and months until next season and hope things change.
People acting like this games over seem to be forgetting Georgia''s defense is ELITE
I sense it too...
Ahhh, duh! Thank you
[I just wanna say...](https://i.imgur.com/CUwcxX1.png)
I wish people in here stop crying over having to wake up and go to work tomorrow. We all do, stop bitching about it...
Jake? you in there?
Bama should just punt it. They'll never see it coming.
Whyyyyyyy
Jesus that''s early for classes to start.
Yeah, pretty impressed with his demeanor
If we're going to be that hyperbolic, then Bama has no place in this game to begin with.
I've never seen such one-sided officiating in a game of these stakes.  Disgusting.
Fuck I was trying to open the bathroom door....
no shit.  2 close plays and no replays
I choose life 
Dont act like you dont know
 Both teams get a possession no matter what
Or Panthers.I've seen Cam look SO BAD under pressure some times.
omg atlanta/dawg fans are about to have the worst PTSD ever.
Praying for a meteor 
Earn me some money Tua.
This ends with either a 60 yard QB scramble or a TD on a slant pass of the same length
Alabama is not an elite team. Playing Mercer does not make you elite 
The faU
Dude, I'm no Dawgs fan, but Fromm is a baller.
Lord if Bama wins with a true freshman qb
idk I feel like Bama coming back but falling short is a more better script for this game. I can feel a turnover here.
I lol'd.
He's like 19 years old. 
You were the Chosen One, Georgia! You were supposed to destroy the Saban Dynasty, not allow its continuation! 
Georgia hasn''t let the country down this bad since the election.
If this ends with a Bama field goal I'm going to shit the biggest brick
Both teams get a chance from the 25
WE GET IT KIRK. HE'S A FRESHMAN.
Defense we need you
Dead

This is really gonna happen...fuck :-(
We''re going to have a five hour game. 
Do most /r/cfb threads have this much bitching about refs?
Bill Gates who?
>Fleaflicker to 48>48 punches it in
My gosh is Herbstreit fellating himself. I think he sits on the toilet at ESPN and gets off on himself talk.
Fromm fucked up a probable 1st down with that overthrow. Frustrating.
love you Ruquan
Jake Fromm State Farm?
The only time I will pray to be spared from dick sucking
yeah cause you're broke as shit lol
It's too late. His blood sacrifice of that freshman DB sealed his victory. 
Didn't work last time
Please let's see a pick 6
Roquan with another game altering play...fucking amazing
Should have been the drinking game...
\#thefaU
Nah this is Bama we're talking about. You can never have hope against them.
YOU MOVED FROM HAWAII TO FUCKING ALABAMA? THAT IS THE WORST DECISION YOU COULD EVER MAKE WTF
[deleted]
There was the Braves that one time
20 yard field goal for the win incoming
Hurts is being a great teammate but you know this shits eating him up inside.
DAWGS BABY CMON 
why doesn tthe bulldogs run the ball?
im going to need more beer but i dont want to walk to the fridge
DAM IT AUBURN
Bama has a true Freshman QB?
I mean so is Georgias? 
Is there any serious possibility that Hurts leaves Bama after getting benched in the natty?
T R U E F R E S H M A N
It would just make perfect sense honestly. The dark overlords are upon us. 
LOL, Bama didn''t even have to use any TOs there
As a Falcons fan, fuck everything about another blown lead in a Championship game. These fans have already had so much heartbreak.
I tweeted at them they said they can't tell us who.
Nice to see Hurts being a good teammate about being subbed out. That is, if it was because of his play and not injury 
48 is going to score the game winner. Calling it. 
'Bama PK sucks ass...
TRUE FRESHMAN I REPEAT SOMETHING HAS BEEN DONE BY A TRUE FREHSMAN WHO WAS NOT IN SCHOOL A YEAR AGO.
Dude has like 1 emotion 
Knoxville pls
ur flairs....
[deleted]
how many years ago was he in high school?
Damn this is intense.
TD please
Something to do with Atlanta man. TO ALL FUTURE TEAMS WITH THE LEAD, DO NOT PLAY IT CONSERVATIVE, I REPEAT. DO NOT. PLAY CONSERVATIVELY IT NEVER WORKS 
True freshman 
Check your DVR delay
Fullcast was right, this game hurts to watch.
Well shit. I was hoping this would go into overtime.
Chaney iced his own guy.
The very same.
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
Odds Saban cracks his knuckles and says "it's Saban time" to himself?
What a choke job. This one is gonna hurt for a while. 
seriously. Imagine where we could be if he played 4 quarters.
You're forgetting about the beautiful UCF championship narrative that shines even brighter with an Alabama win
Ha, I''ll enjoy my extra 15 minutes of sleep!
Who has it worse if Bama wins, UGA or Auburn fans?
Georgia has a true freshman QB too don't they?
Take my upvote, I'm in a good mood
I dont know if I can even subject myself to watching Bama win another. I'm off to /r/eyebleach
they turned off the hurts cam, boooooooo
How much harder can the announcers suck off the qb on Alabama 
"They are who we thought they were! ......... THEY ARE WHO WE THOUGHT THEY WERE!!!!"
Saban forgot he had a passer on the sidelines 
Lol sadly you are right.
but he was wearing crimson so (shrug)
Would laugh so hard if UGA gets a pick six
Clenchometer is up to 11/10. 
How much money do we bet that flags march them down the field in the event they don't get away with a hold that isn't called? 
Good job Georgia, you played yourself. All of college football was counting on you to strike bama down. 
You would have enough nickels to spell freshman.
ESPN doesn't want a lynching on their hands 
I'm pissed this game turned into a ref shit show at the end to make Alabama tie it up
Just imagine if Tua goes down, Saban tries to put Hurts back in, and Hurts refuses?
I would love some of those wings right now.
I love that guy.
[deleted]
ESPN got a hurts boner
We might...
Fromm is becoming 4th quarter Matt Ryan in the SB.
UCF for NC. Make it happen AP
Tua does have a lot to learn on the zone read that's for sure
srsly
You can only get flags by punching another player or by being UGA
If we win this game I want to thank a weak ass SEC schedule for giving us time to play our true freshman QB in meaningful snaps.
found the woman in the Nissan commercial
TACKLING IS NOT THAT HARD
tua int 2 pix 
Same thing
Man, Jalen Hurts just seems like a really good dude
JFC they're going to do it again.
So many missed calls and bullshit calls
I cannot comprehend moving from Hawaii to Alabama.
Fuck me. The bar I'm in closes at midnight.
Face mask?
Put Eason in next drive and march down the field and score. Saban may have been playing 4D chess with Tua, but Kirby''s playing 5D with Eason
Jalen Hurts come to #theFau 
Imagine if their cock was this hard for freshman in college basketball. 
Ball game!
There you go, good start, 3 more downs boys, 3 more. Boy we need a miracle here, a turnover please
rackle him for fucks sake, jeez
at least you guys didnt blow a 28-3 lead.
[deleted]
Gimme OT
Welp too bad Ohio State and Penn State got fucked by the committee because either would have beat the fuck out of both of these teams.
When I tuned in at halftime it was 13-0. Did Georgia miss an extra point or did they kick two field goals or what?
There have been so many blown calls that made this game the way it is.
Imagine moving from Hawaii to fucking Alabama. LOL
No one will see this but I''m sad the cfb season is over cause now I won''t be able to hide my severe alcohol abuse by saying “I''m just watching the game” 
Thank you for joining us for this year's installment of "Bama Gets What They Want All The Time." Tune in next year where Bama flirts with losing two games in the regular season, but then sneaks into the playoff against all odds and wins the title again.
DAWWWWWGSSSSZSSS
1
it's over.
looks like it will be another Alabama/Patriots championship year fellas
K was down before first
Mark Richt has lost control of.....something
Shoulda been a false start and a re kick. Still not a block
Tua reminds me of a young Russell Wilson.  Kids gonna be a star.
This is exciting.
the dude just fell for 5 yards
Catch me mumbling the word "freshman" in my sleep for the next two weeks
I've hit that silver lever in the bathroom quite a few times 
Would driving in you truck help? 
I am stress eating that 11:50pm.  Fuck me. 
Never forget Georgia blew a 20-7 lead
Najee Harris is crazy good 
[deleted]
AND TRUE FRESHMEN
I appreciate your commitment to call out my failure
first down by gravity
Is the Georgia band playing "Sleep" by The Smiths? 
OT?
[removed]
I can tell whose palms are sweating by their posts
Yep. Hell of a play by Ridley. Pretty sure that's incomplete or an INT if Ridley doesn't hustle
That dude has so much momentum that even the ground can't stop him
These dudes are so tired they cant tackle. Just the run the ball for a field goal
Payback for all you SEC fans making fun of Michigan for blowing a bowl lead, now *your* guys did it!^^kill ^^^me
Tua might want to glance up at the playclock every once in a while.... 
    freshman
look i was alright when the falcons completely blew it and lost the superbowl because fuck the nfl... but this.... this is not okay... i will be done with football if we lose.
BALANCE
No matter what happens, Roquan has proven he is the best football player on the field today. 
good game here boys
It's that sec speed 
Yes, in particular if it's Iowa State.
Ugh...... Alabama gonna win on a FG. 
does this feel like 2012 to anyone else?
He just drew a penis
Atlanta on suicide watch anytime they have a lead
Too late 
I know.  From paradise to a shithole.  Lovely
Thought about it and have done that in the past but there's not much time left in the game anyway so I may just ride it out
IF I HEAR TRUE FRESHMAN ONE MORE TIME I AM GOING TO EAT A TIDE POD
Wow. Georgia is really about to Georgia this. 
but the public was heavy on bama?? unless...
48 punches another player48 punches his own coachSaban puts him back in the game
Fucking Georgia sports teams... first you allow the patriots to win and now this shit
That dude just stumbled 7 yards for a first down lol
FALSE START
Can we get another kick 6?? that was fun last time that happened to bama.
Can you imagine growing up in Hawaii and moving to shithole Alabama for college? Dude must really love football.
Did we forget how to tackle?
For the Natty...
Yes. 
UGA's biggest mistake was watching Bama tape, when they should've been watching B1G tape.
Bama getting away with holds all game 
Guy's, I just learned that Alabama's quarterback is a true Freshman from Hawaii! Crazy to think a year ago he was in high school! /s
What can I say Georgia teams choke
Transfer or position change. He not QB anymore
this is real I believe
I have sources checking on it. There''s no way to be sure right now. 
The Braves are somehow going to blow a 4-0 world series lead this year. 
Georgia''s Defense looks dead. Alabama got this game 
If they win, where does pulling hurts rank in the most genius moves in CFB history?
BAH GOD ITS THE YELLOW JACKET INQUISITION
When a fan puts their hands on the sides of their head in disbelief. Makes em look like a cobra.
You''re all forgetting the fact that these are TRUE FRESHMEN
After soo many blown calls in the NFL this past weekend, thought it would be impossible to see a worse officiated game. I was wrong
I'm sure Hurts giving Tua his support helps a lot with his confidence.
No way UGA keeps em out of FG range.
Does college football always have this few commercials?
I AM BOTH OVERJOYED AND IN PAIN
/r/cfb red wedding is happening in real time
Wow, what a run by Harris.Alabama must be growing these fucking running backs in a lab.
There are literally hundreds of non-georgia fans complaining about the refs...but it's all bullshit yea
Dude just tripped eleven yards. 
AHHH LOUD NOISES 
What is that flair
i honestly think he's gone for sure after this, it's clear who the better QB is
Those flashing lights behind the endzone must be so distracting for the players.
If bama comes backs and win. Gotta respect Nick Saban for making such a ballsy call. I know Hurts was playing horrible but that's bold as fuck to bench your 21-2 starting QB in the championship game
Fuck Bamas going to win
Lawyer ball loses games.
Four and out four and Out
Not playing to win.
OC choked.  3 pass plays when u have The best RB duo in the game
Please let him transfer to FAU and lead them on their quest for blood
Imagine a pick six 
That's all?  I want more commercials.
yes
Anyone else suspect an OT is coming?
**O  V  E  R  T  I  M  E      T  H  R  E  A  D****V****E****R****T****I****M****E****T****H****R****E****A****D**
Not tonight. Ball game.
This thread has been pretty mild, tbh
Place was lit. Never seen a crowd like that in all my years watching cfb. It had a different feel than anything else. 
Come on Georgia we can''t have Bama win another one :/
put some mustard on these Dawgs, manthey're cooked
This is gonna fucking happen. Fuck
Is this the Hawaiian kid where the Bama fan forum had a thread asking what language he spoke?
ummm, delay of game?
Do they resume being allowed to call holding on Alabama now that the game is tied?
Flag?
Disgusting officiating 
Alabama is nice 
If the team that gets the ball first gets a TD, the other team still gets a chance to score one as well. No sudden death. 
Flag not being alabama 15 yd penalty and 6 free points
Georgia barely even trying to tackle, can't remember the last time the first guy made the tackle
Well fuck
FOR ALL THE TOSTITOS
but have you considered arizona state?
You can''t hurt me again Nick! I''m going back to Lane
HURTS CAM IS BACK!
live by the freshman die by the freshman
[Every time Harris picks up 5 more yards after contact](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e-TXWIf_DE)
can we get a fucking stop yo
Never estimate teams mildly losing at halftime
are they just never going go call a hold

so THIS is why Georgia sports is so miserable
my GOD Herby.....they're ALL "young" freshmen.
IT'S TUA TIME
Struggling to watch this game now. Fk me 
Calling it. OT after Georgia missed fg
Georgia doesn't apply any pressure, then this game is lost.
true freshman
It''s be funny if he only left a second and you know...
RIP Dennis Green
I DONT KNOW HOW TO FEEL
Watching the Patriots and Alabama just keep getting championships gifted to them is just nauseating.
Before Bama comes back and wins this, don't get mad at Bama. Be mad at yourselves for saying the dynasty is over and lighting a fire
Playoff committee are fully engorged over this right now.
that was the ugliest draw play i have ever seen, wtf 
Would help if they let him play. Too much Wildcat and other bullshit.
lol
And he''s back on the next kickoff.Lol
Falling forward an entire 10 yards #JustBamaBackThings
Can the NCAA give Bama the death penalty already...
Harris dgaf
Did they just draw Roger from Doug on the screen?
Ok I''m waiting for the random player to jump to light speed and destroy the Bama bench and lord voldersabenvader
ESPN streaming is hot garbage. 
Most pac12 game threads, yes.
Because your team is trashEdit: oh I'm sorry, you're definitely not the only team where players attack their own fucking teammates
Oh ok lol
Why is Kirby rooting for Bama?
We''re back in “Georgia''s offense appears to be a series of poor decisions” territory
what the fuck, watch-espn?!I'd be having a better time listening to the game on the radio. 
Not again. 
GIVE ME OT OR GIVE ME THE OFF-SEASON 
Georgia's d line looks exhausted
I hate the Patriots and Crimson Tide equally for how they absolutely fuck over games like this.  They take the John Cena approach - you know they're going to win, but they make you pissed off by thinking there's a chance.
THEY CAN'T KEEP GETTING AWAY WITH IT.
14 getting exposed for Georgia 
he trippin''
The choke is real
GAMES OVER BAMA WON
I got advice from a fuckwit, my now ex-boyfriend. I was champ last year, clearly should have ignored him
Congratulations to the referees for winning the College Football Playoff. Amazing performance.
NCAA 2005 Update: My Gator defense is superhuman right now as they forced another punt after the last mistake. Gators ball at their own 25 with 2:32 until halftime. 8-0 the score over Arkansas. Don't fuck this up offense
Bama bought to win 
0 non garbage time snaps
For me it's not what church it's baptist or Protestant if you were Protestant people treated u like shit, baptist acted holier than thou
Will ESPN ever stop sucking Alabama's dick?Will I ever not root for a team who won't win the big 12 CCG?Short answer: no
No one likes false freshman
fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck
LOL
Good game dogs. You got beat by the refs not alabama
GIVE ME OVERTIME OR GIVE ME DEATH
I swear to fuck
Good game Georgia. All of america knows that  you are the better team, regardless of how many calls and momentum the refs give Bana
what bothers me the most is that this justifies the nonsense of putting Bama in at #4
28-3 incoming
Harris is a damn BULLDOG
WARNING: Surrender Cobras have been spotted in this area.
Jesus, Georgia's fucking blowing it.
Playcalling. 
Georgia's defense has basically no answer for this running back
M E T A
Yeah but nobody likes Bama
My point was that playing conservative isn't always a bad idea, and that playing aggressive can sometimes bite you in the back ahaha. POW6R!
Oh no 
After tonight, Saban has no real reason to go back to him next season. 
Georgia was killing it all night until the refs fucked them and their momentum left and right in the second half.  Yeah they blew chances, but the refs are handing this one to Bama no about about it.
Atlanta sports fans are fucking tortured. I say this as a Lions fan
It''s like I''m watching a slow motion crash 
Tuas throws are sex 
Not a time to play prevent Georgia
send me the video
You mean you hope we don't lose because we had to kick?
Georgia wtf how did you blow this
You can't rush 5 and not get close to the QB...
Georgia kick six to win it I'm calling it right now
Livestream link?
When were you when UGA die? 
Ballgame
There it is!
Wooooooooo
chat is moving so fast nobody will see that I have fantasies of JJ Watt
FUCK THESE REFS
woooooooow
lol and there it is
I'm on my last beer.  If this goes overtime then we've got a problem on our hands.
BRUHHHHHH
Wow another Georgia penalty huh
LMAOOOOOOOO OFCOURSE 
There is no way Bama doesn't score here 
It's so fucking painful. I'm more disappointed in Georgia fans right now than our Offense. But fuck the Referees; Fromm got Fairley'd into the ground after a play and they didn't call shit for it. That was a free touchdown.
But you call that face mask wow
THAT'S IT I GUESS
This isn''t tempo they get the plays off at the 15 second mark
SALT INCOMING
Top 1
>"I'm rooting for the Chiefs"Fucking gross.
oof
They're grown adults that bark at you.
He already sold his soul to get where he's at.
These refs man
That was delay of game...
Wow. UGA meltdown keeps ramping up. 
So far I'm 0-4 for playoff football this weekend. Go Dawgs...
Let's be friends.. Choklahoma 
They are. Did you know that the younger brother, until moments ago, was showing up more than the older brother?
Now you call a facemask?
Give me a fucking breakEdit:  pretttttttyyyy bad facemaskI am upset rn
Bama just needs a field goal. Georgia's  offense just collapsed
This is setting up perfectly for a kick six...
So the refs do know how to call face masks?They forgot earlier 
Damn it.  this is heartbreaking and i'm not even a Georgia fan
Now they call face mask?
OH NOW YOU CALL A FUCKING FACE MASK????????//
If bama gets into fg range, wonder if GA is better off just letting Bama score so they can get the ball back
Roquan Smith is awesome 
Choking hazard. 
Oh really?
And that's the game 
Ahaha so NOW they're calling face masks??
what a shock, call against georgia
OH SO NOW WE'RE GOING TO CALL FACEMASKS
FUCK YES GET THAT FUCKIN FACEMASK WE WIN YALL LOSE
Of course they call this one
and that facemask about does it
Oh, now they know what a face mask looks like. Cool. 
Call that both ways, boys.
And I passed up sex with the wife to watch the refs give this to Bama
Oh so now they call face masks?
That puts them in FG range
Based on what? OSU's offense looked like absolute dog shit against you guys
Oh so now they call the facemask
I hate College Football.  Fuck Bama.
Now they call face mask 
I''d Georgia forget how to tackle? 
Game is rigged. Absolute joke. 
This hurts to watch.
Georgia looks exhausted.  Hang in there Dawgs.
Lol now they call a facemask of course. 
at least you have the Hawks
Oh man... I hate all of you and this is painful to watch. 
Game over
God dammit Georgia. This is an epic choke. 
The refs fucked Georgia so so bad. 
Here we gooooo
Fromm is a solidly mediocre QB
now they call a facemask. Fuck this shit
That's it 
Mike Stoops must have murdered the UGA DC and taken over. 
Woooooooooow 
GTFOH...
Last second field goal, it comes short, the Georgia returns it for a touchdown, they pull off their UGA jerseys, revealing they were actually Auburn in disguise, it's the Iron Bowl all over again, Auburn bequeaths their trophy to UCF. It all makes sense now! 
No way they aren't winning now.
What the absolute fuck, the officials wake up now?
So is this when Bama's kicker is going to do something right?Edit: Never depend on a Bama kicker.
Big 10 winning the championship when they didn't even make the playoffs
That was delay of the game
**T E A M - F R E S H M A N** 
Holy fucking shit refs
OH NOW YOU CAN CALL A FUCKING FACE MASK?! 
Only Bama is allowed to grab face masks.
Harris might be the best back on Bama''s roster. 
Just as long as you ROLL it. xD
DeBeers is currently in talks to purchase the mineral rights to my colon. Butthole so tight I'm shitting diamonds.
Oh they call that facemask, of fucking course
Ohhhh callin facemask on UGA, that''s rich
Are you ducking kidding me? These refs....
Oh, but you'll call facemask on us? Fuck you refs. Fuck you.
Now they call it
Dude was 1 arm off a TD
This is an implosion 
*Roll Tide pod
I've never been the biggest fan of him but I have nothing but respect for the way he's handled being benched
Oh don''t get me wrong. Mad props to Tagovailoa! Expecting huge things out of him in the future from this one half. 
WHY DO ATLANTA TEAMS ALWAYS CHOKE
Parrish is so bad
tRUe FreShmaN
i'm tired and i want to go to bed
oh so nowwwww they call face masks lmao go to hell bama
Oh now they call a facemask
HORSESHIT
I''m not mad Georgia, I''m disappointed 
WOW thats a huge penalty, but completely correct.
George defense is spent and momentum is all on Alabama's side. GG
LOL SO THEY CALL FACWMASK ON GA BUT NOT THE 3 ON BAMA HAHAHHAHA fuck this
The fix is in. This has been the worst officiated half I have ever seen. 
Oh, now they call the facemask... 
lol, now they want to call a face mask
Wow, a face mask call?Fuck, Georgia.
That line wasn't set...
nice of them to remember what a face mask is
Congrats Bama
Why would you do that... 
I love all these armchair referees in this thread
Then jump into the stands and choke a guy selling peanuts.
Bamboozle insurance 
Can Hurts come to FSU? We will call it an even trade for Coker.
And he''s back out making tackles.
And now you call a facemask
Now they call facemasks lol
Regardless of the outcome, the national champion will still have one ugly mark from us in their L column. *maniacally laughs*
Idiot play from Parrish.
Done
LOL at facemark that might do in Georgia. Irony.
Looked pretty mutual to me...
I swear to fucking God. These refs are the most fucked I've seen
And that''s all she wrote folks. Was a pleasure this year 
I thought we weren't calling facemasks?!
haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahahahahahahaha
NOW THEY CALL A FUCKING FACE MASK? 
This is just fucking awful.
REFS WIN CHAMPIONSHIPS
Lol so they call it on UGA? Fuck this refball horseshit
HOLY SHIT THE OFFICIALS FINALLY SAW A FACEMASK I GUESS HUH
UGA=fucked
What? Georgia didn't get that call all game. Fuck this.
Now they call a face mask? 
L M A O  O O O O O OO FACEMASK OUT OF BOUNDS GEORGIA IN SHAMBLES
Oh dear
Fuckin A, why does everybody that plays "Bama just collapse in the fourth. 
That''s it. That''s game. 
Now they call a facemask
Holy...fuck. The refs really are in Bama's pocket. 
What?  These refs know what a facemask is???
DAE BAMA DIRTY?!
Lmao after all the missed Bama facemask they call that now.
Ho. Ly. Shit.
clear facemask can't complain
Rumor has it that a freshman is playing in this game, somewhere. Still trying to figure out which position.
That's the game 
Tagged
That wasn't a face mask?
Two FGs
people calling for pick 6 when we know you really want kick 6
Fuck these refs lmfao. Legit won't call shit on Bama.
NOW THEY CALL THE FUCKING FACEMASK. WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK
They both facemask each other lol
Crash and fucking burn wow
Bama gonna win on a FG.
Fuckin Fuck
FU both ways ref
Convenient that these refs remember that facemasks are a thing *now*
espn film room and watching these guys discuss and argue whats happening the game is way better than shitty commentators.
They're just giving Bama the game now
FRESHMEN 
Georgia sports are cursed. Fuck
Come on, that went both ways.
Jesus Christ these refs are extremely one sided. 
THIS STATE IS CURSED
sure, NOW they see the facemask
What about all of Alabama''s face masks throughout the game? 
Thaaaat was dumb 14
Uh oh 
UGA now just UGH
offensive player is grabbing his face mask too. ha ha wtf. 
No doubt on that call
YOU'RE BLOWING IT GARY
Now they call a facemask 
Lol refs.
OH NOW YOU WANNA CALL A FACE MASK . FUCK YOU.
fucking refs, lol
So face mask is still a rule
GG? 
Harris...next Beastmode
Georgia D rise up
LOLOLOL
Oh my God
Cheers
RMFT!
That''s what we do in Georgia. Shanahan last year. Chaney this year. It''s embarrassing.
refs are blind for Alabama but see everything for UGA 
That's game
This is the most bulldogs thing ever 
That's a ridiculously huge penalty 
now they call the facemask?
I see
Not so fast
You know how this will end Jesus fucking Christ stop pretending for just one moment. Holy fucking the shit the smugness of you Bama fans is simply unreal, it is unrivaled by any other sporting team in the history of man my fucking GOD
I'm just here for the chaos
Wow I am so pissed if I'm a Georgia fan
Lol but they saw that one okay
Why does our defense look so small compared to bama''s offense? 
good season
Well, they saw THAT obvious facemask.
Parrish singlehandedly losing his team the game.
LOL THE REFS ARE SUCH BULLSHIT FR
Now they call it lol
Georgia doing their best to give the game away
Yes.
Y'all need to replace Parish
Holy shit. They're in field goal (ish) range already
they call THAT facemask...
This game's over folks. 
Lol they saw *that* one
So if Bama wins, will Saban forgive #48 for snapping on the sideline and just say that he likes his passion for the game?
Yep, thats a facemask.
Damn Georgia really shitting the bed 
Parrish having himself a shocker of a game 
These refs can go fuck themselves
So facemask is a penalty we ARE calling this game. Good to know. 
GG LSU
How?
Georgia is trying to arm tackle way too much and they're getting burned by it.
GG Georgia. I'm sorry about your curse. 
So two guys grab each other's masks, only one gets called 
Georgia....dont Georgia.
Rip
Oh god damn it Georgia sports, quit letting me down
Let somebody else have a turn :(
Yeah, can't really complain about that, just wish they'd called the one earlier
Imagine the torment that Atlanta Falcons and Georgia Bulldogs fans have to go through after seeing this happen to them in consecutive championship games.
Refs are gifting mama this game
I mean that was a clear as day facemask......
Wow. These refs were definitely paid at half time.  This is some serious bias.
Georgia...... guys..... come on
NOW THEY CAN CALL A FACE MASK
They don't call the facemasks on georgia but they call it on bama LOL GOOD GAME. All the proof I needed.  Unreal.
Gotta be smarter than that
Huge flag
Georgia throwing this game straight down the garbage disposal
full choke
Oh god the face mask. Salt in the damn wound. This would be such a guilty "I'll take it" natty
Georgia is self destructing 
GIVE IT TO US BABY JUST GIVE IT TO US
That's game hendrix
oh now they'll call a facemask
Oh damn that's a bad facemask.
Oh, geez, not close to not being a facemask.
RIP nice knowing you man 
I got you fam
Because Bama has the momentum this time
youre stupid as FUCK
Wow, the refs _do_ know what a facemask is. Funny how that works in bama's favor.
NOW they call a facemask?
Kiss my fuckin ass. These refs have been missing calls all fuckin night but they get that one? Bullshit 
Ah now they want to call facemask.
Alabama with their new QB looks great running Chip Kelly's offense.
Are the true freshmen elite?
WHEW WE DRIVIN! WE IN THIS
The amount of choke jobs in football this week.
Georgia in sport just doesnt seem to be able to have nice things
Both should get a facemask penalty there.
Have you seen this truefreshman?  
It might feel edgy to say that, but it's just stupid. 
Oh now they call personal fouls
Theres a facemask call!! Fuck it all
Fuck these big ten refs 
the replay had both players with a facemask
Dear God let it end
God dammit please dont blow this game
Georgia is drowning. They know they are going to lose 
by teams from georgia, no less
Na that shit isn't happening 
Like a facemask?
Incoming salt over the facemask call (which is fair)
Where have they been hiding Najee Harris
No, I would rather you guys play Hurts next year. 
You tell me, Auburn.
So they call facemask on georgia but not bama lol
Lol missed three facemask against us
He was already out of bounds
They can't keep getting away with this
Fucking of course Bama is gonna win after throwing true freshmen out there.
:(
Well of course they wouldn't miss that one
This would end on a face mask call
I knew all that sideline overexcitement would come back to bite Georgia in the ass.
ha gayyyyy
oh for fucking fucks sake.....GEORGIA STAHP!
ahhh damn
Game
NOW THEY CALL A FACEMASK?! At least be consistent! This is some bullshit
And suddenly we're calling facemask.
Now the refs are calling face masks huh? Lol
Don''t we all though 
THE ENTIRE COUNTRY OUTSIDE OF ALABAMA IS ON YOUR SIDE
This reffing has been laughably one sided. God dammit.
That's game.
So now we calling face mask 
well, he's going to have to fight Tua for the starting job and I don't think he can win, so probably.
Keep crying
Nephew
Busted
Silly Georgia, getting away with penalties are for 'Bama.
I don't watch CFB ever but Georgia is getting FUCKED and has been for the last 3 minutes at least.
Bama's jerseys look like they say 2:18 with the white football on a white background.
Not lik dis
That facemask call was fucking huge. Why not call the others though.
Their depth just wears you down 
I'm drunk I cant read right
But... I like Bama...
God almighty the stadium sounds like two marching bands fighting inside a cement truck. 
This is the most Georgia thing to ever Georgia in like, at least a year
I thought they turned off facemasking 
My God... Is it the Georgian curse
Please no I can't handle another year of cocky Bama fans. Work is gonna be insufferable tomorrow. 
The Falcons/Bulldogs memes sure will be something 
Georgia no....please no!
But not Clemson :( 
https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.usatoday.com/amp/94128238
For fuck's sake... Fucking Bama is going to win again.
why do they even bother playing the season out?  just rank bama #1 at the beginning of the year and call it.  no need for this charade.  
Yall need to stfu this game osnfar from over
#14 gettting burnt all day 
Holy shit the bs calls are obvious 
Dawgs, please you Dawgs, hold em here.....hold em here, push em back you Dawgs please!
I'm cheering for OT. Sleep be damned! I don't want this to end.
Gg
UGA definitely the better team tonight
I mean, that definitely was a face mask
That's a little too 4D chess for me, but hey, perhaps
There exists a God and he is doing everything to make me unhappy.
Fuck refs fuck bama fuck college football playoffs 
who wants to find a tall building and take a plunge with me stat
Now they call shit all on UGA. Typical..
FUCK THE REFS LET HTEM PLAY
We all knew this was going to happen
Ballgame
NOW A FACEMASKM
The right call, but they've gotta call that consistently.
Nope
On the bright side for the Buckeye fans here who might be Cavs fans, Lebron James has always won an NBA title in the year Bama won the national championship since 2010.So, if the trend holds out, a Bama national title tonight would mean that Lebron James wins his 4th NBA title this year as well.
Georgia wtf
Lol they just helping the drive now. Miss all the calls for Georgia, but you call every on that happens against Bama.
lol
Me too bud.
Well that's game unless the kicker chokes
Playclock...0????
So NOW we're calling facemasks, huh? 
 This is happening lol, damn 
ROLL TIDE! 
Football will be made illegal in the State of Georgia if this actually happens.
We shan't be hearing the end of facemasks after this one methinks
Oh. So they saw that face mask? Of course they did. 
Unfortunately, I don't think it will. 
Not as nauseating as a blue field
Eh, 20-7 is two scores. I feel like people who think that's some kinda epic collapse need to watch more football or stfu.
They played conservative big time. Like being up by two scores was actually four scores or something lol. 
To lazy to put UGA from my mobile...
I need Bama to win to see the absolute salt mine this place will become 
These refs are so biased it's not even funny.
Feel bad for him, but man I''m loving Tua
oh now you call the facemask these fucking refs
The Tua-Harris combo is so damn good.
If Georgia is going to win, this would be a good time to do it.
It was right?
>duckingWrong team, that is Oregon.
OC. He''s fucking shit.
Sure probs goes both ways.  But these were pretty obvious penalties on Alabama that happened right in front of the refs.  I think it'd be difficult to find equally game changing penalties that shoulda been called the other way, but if you got any examples, I'm listening.  
You can blame the refs for a lot of bad calls. But not that one. That shit was so egregious. 
Complain about refs all you want, that was a clear facemask. 
Goodnight everyone. I''ve seen this movie so many times. Fuck.
that wont be controversial after the earlier mask....
Now they decide to call facemasks 
Obviously the Dawgs played like shit this fourth quarter but you cannot say the refs didn''t change this game monumentally in Bama''s favor.
UGA could use a fumble here
That's gotta be annoying for Dawg fans.
Clear as day, c'mon Dawgs keep your composure
Don''t lump us in with everyone else. 
Fuck Bama, but I hope they win.
Well, we finally have confirmation they only call face masking penalties in one direction. 
I'm worried for the Alabama kicker. If he misses a game winning kick I'm worried for his safety.
That just cost them the game 
Smith is the next Polamalu. Mark my words.
Move to the hard stuffIf you lack hard stuff, move to gasoline
Fantasies*
I am sure the rainbow warriors would have given him just as good a college career.
Pls.
I feel a little pang of empathy for all the fans in attendance that paid $2000+ dollars to watch Georgia Football Meltdown Part Deux: College Edition
Cool. I guess the refs figured out how to call a face mask.
This is only the second worst throw for the state of Georgia in the past 12 months.
Glad Alabama will get that call but UGA can't. Both blatant, only one called. 
I blame Matt Ryan
I guess they remember what a facemask looks like now.
Atlanta curse extends to Athens
Richt gunna Richt!
Oh goodness.  I sense a lot of buttholes tightening in this thread.
https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org
fumble it
Aggressive penalties ftw 
It''s a lose-lose, obviously, but I''m tired of my Georgia friends barking at me this entire month
That was straight out of the longest yard.
Georgia baby what is you doing
"No OT tonight... Ball game"-Tua Tagovailoa
Now you call the facemask
Each team gets a possession in the red zone. If both score a TD or FG. It goes to another OT
These refs have never seen a hold in their life apparently. Call Kirby quick to tell the oline to start holding bama
This is the biggest ref screwjob I've ever seen in a NCG
Georgia y'all need to get a different CB. That kid has done nothing but hurt you tonight.
Ouch that face mask
Oh well, another team killing themselves with penalties 
welp - unless they get a turnover here its over
The Tide is gonna roll, isn't it?
UGA this buds for you.Pls W
No idea how Tua is with the ladies, but I'd assume it's about to get a loooot easier for him.
That was 6 feet of facemask not a barely noticeable one.
Alabama is the team with the black and white jerseys, right?
[This sub rn.](https://i.imgur.com/A0dhKim.jpg)
just sell out to stop the run
Enjoy the fucking gift Bama. Fuck this sport. 
[deleted]
Georgia needs to be calling time out. 
14 fucking sucks for Georgia. Completely lost them this game 
Fromm did not know daway 
At least we collapsed before the game started
Tua has seriously outplayed Fromm this game, and Georgia has shown little confidence in Fromm to get the job done when push has come to shove.  Retreating into a shell on offense loses games.
Yup call the dirty plays now refs with the game reaching 2 mins. Lol 
Get a touchdown please don't depend on papanasty
Please Georgia. For my sanity.
If they say "freshman" one more time. . .
Bama gets everything called for them and NOTHING called against them, I'm not even exaggerating either.
If you thought this subreddit was salty before... 
yeah
Georgia is about to lose by 3. That''s a winning bet.  
GOD IS DEAD, AND NICK SABAN KILLED HIM
THATS THE FUCKING FACEMASK YOU CALL ARE YOU FUCKING SERIOUS?!?!?!?!
What a choke by Georgia. 
ok can we fire these fucking refs
That Bama QB looks ripe to get stripped
FRESHMEN
Georgia got stupid when it most mattered. RIP
...
That house is cursed. 
That was a completely legitimate call.
That was a facemask.
So cool they can all of a sudden see face masks again.
Oh fuck off
Now how much do you trust your kicker.
14 getting abused like a rented mule
The look on the georgia fans
obviously ESPN forced that guy to grab Ridley's facemask
Refs
This is so bad of a choke that Oklahoma should laugh 
wut? he got dragged down by his facemask. open your eyes
Yup
lol the refs are trash, I'm sorry.
That's rich.
Definitely a penalty, but so is punching the QBs head...
So many babies are going to be named Tua in nine months if they pull this off. 
game
**THE EMPIRE ON WHICH THE SUN NEVER SETS**
$$$$$
Shit this is sad
Fuck Bama
Let them score
Oh you saw that one huh?
WHY IS GEORGA NOT USING TIMEOUTS
Good stop 
Georgia might want to start using timeouts here.
The 35 is the target line for the kicker? Damn. He that good or espn bad? 
SPEND MY DOLLAR
Only against Bama. 
Blame the state of Georgia
Patriots? Don't start comparing the pros to college. Much more parity in the NFL
The absolute darkest timeline.
Hurts is watching....
Atlanta is having some Superbowl flashbacks
This may be the most Georgia loss I have ever watched
I told y''all before the game even started the big 10 would find a way to blow the championship game 
These refs are screwing Georgia
This choke reminds me of the falcons. Good times.
Refs handing this game to Bama.  That's a shame.
YOU WERE THE CHOSEN ONE! YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO DEFEAT BAMA, NOT JOIN THEM!Also, the Bama reciever totally grabbed the defender's facemask first.
Same reason a pass was complete in the NFL if the receiver didn't get two feet in bounds due to contact with a defensive player (which has since changed). Being "pushed" out of bounds doesn't make the clock stop
Penn State threw away our playoff dreams on that Michigan State game.
Whelp.  This is what I get for opening my fucking mouth.
The one where we're driving with a 1:25 left? 
Did they miss a delay of game?
Lol
Man that just sucks lol
Sorry the state of Georgia 
Guy gets literally tackled by his face mask. This sub: WTF is wrong with these refs? This game is rigged!
Help! My dog is choking and I don't know what to do 
I'm ready to hear that Stone Cold music hit and see UCF walking to the field 
[You all knew it was coming so here we go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KquFZYi6L0)
Alabama is always falling forward
Gonna be so sad when Bama wins off a goddamn field goal after running the clock down to :03
THAT FACEMASK IS A KILLER
Oh Georgia you fucked this up
how can you complain about that, he drags him down by the facemask, doesn't even get pads
People saying UGA choked. Id give the refs a lot more credit. 
Yay. Bama wins again. So over this sport EDIT: and the face mask call lol you call it now huh? 
I hate everything about this game.
There's going to be yet another ref problem after this game
Duck theee refs ick yo 
Parrish you fucking fuck your going to cost us a national championship 
Will we ever be free?
That's the facemask they call? Lol
Not like this...
Or so you thought nobody would see this
And georgia doesnt win the big one once again :/
I'M SORRY GEORGIA.
Funny how the refs see all the facemasks on bama...
Does that penalty cost them the championship?
UGA USE YOUR TIMEOUTS NOW
IT IS TIED!
So Georgia gets a facemask, but Alabama doesn't?https://media.giphy.com/media/fWvmlOrAEILss/giphy.gif
I am numb to Alabama winning titles so it's ok. 
give bama the call on facemask
**I LOVE CHAMPIONSHIPS WON BY FIELD GOALS**
Where are the refs from?
lmao the julio jersey
I need to find a new favorite sport
Man this thread is bitter. 
God, Georgia. I haven't seen a collapse like this in 17 years.
Georgia pls
The line is 3.5Alabama has to score a TD for bettors. 
Fuckin Atlanta sports curse. 
Only hope is for that Greek kid to shank his kick
WatchESPN a slideshow for anyone else? Why is it so hard to watch sports in the year 2018.....
Huh a facemask call 
if Bama wins"and the rich get richer"
Is this a choke or is Saban a genius for the qb change?
Would this loss be worst than 28-3 hypothetically ? 
Ridley was facemasking the defender too.
Oh, now you see a god damn face mask
This fucking game is over FUCK
if the fresh beats us with his arm, so be it
LOL fuck Georgia!
They get tired
OH NOW YOU CALL A FACEMASK
Georgia baby whatcha doin'??
Oh, how the *tides* have turned..... roll tide
I'd rather lose to the champ than the runner up.  Mostly I wanted Bama to beat Georgia by more than they beat us to feel better about our end
FUCKING REFS! CALL IT BOTH WAS YOU PIECES OF SHIT!
[This sub if Bama wins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KquFZYi6L0)
Bama has gotten.  EVERY.. SINGLE... CALL this 2nd half
That's game
Calling everything on UGA but won't call ANYTHING against Bama.
Two Georgia teams choking against the Evil Empire in respective sports...surely not
Nick Saban mind control
Honestly, Edwards excites me almost as much as Deebo. He reminds me so much of Alshon. But no one is nearly as explosive as Deebo on that team. Our WR depth is the strongest point of the team imoAnd a few people in my family grew up cheering for one team and going to college at the other, so we''re usually good about cheering for the other team until their matchup. I like playing a good Clemson team 
The memes are about to be nuts if Georgia loses this game.
Absolute robbery this is an embarrassment to the sport
4th Qtr Yds: ALA leads 147-41
Dont care for either of these teams but love Nick Saban. 
fix is in
Fuck this crew. They took the game out of UGAs hands too many times. Blocked punt, hold on the 4th down, but thank god they see that shlt.
thats not too far from the truth
NCAAF was exciting for a while then they figured out the only way to make it shit.
There goes Davis :,-)
oh shit
You know what I hate? I hate when refs decide those crucial moments in a game. 
And I thought Richt was the reason Georgia could never win. Guess it's just a Georgia thing.
Good call for sure
That's bad.
LMAO
Yea
ultimate trickery,  he's a bama plant, if bama wins he rips off his jacket to reveal a bama jersey and proceeds to lift the CFB trophy
Wow the officiating in this game is muff cabbage
God is a bama fan, btw.
How much does Alabama's kicker weigh? If they ICE him twice would he be seeing 4 goal posts or is that not enough? Is he a lightweight is my question?
Of course now they call a facemask...
We deserve OT
Mark Richt has lost control of Georgia''s national championship performance 
I'm always watching
Are championship collapses just a Georgia statewide thing? Fuck 
That's fucking rich
Let's let r/CFB say that that wasn't a facemask.
Bastard!
the old 15 yard facemask trick
Oh so now you call the facemask penalty. Fuck off refs. Committee might as well give the championship to Bama every year and have all the other teams play for the second place trophy.
they kinda facemasked each other there
Knees weak. Palms sweaty. Vomit on my Derrick Henry jersey already. Dreamland BBQ.
Fucking mobile app sucks a dick.Constantly getting errors.
that plus dehydration seems like the most plausible scenario to me
oh... NOW you call the face mask
Oh NOW You see facemasks?
Good timing to see a facemask
I must admit I like seeing Georgia lose 
The best rec on each team is named Ridley? 
Need to get a turnover or they lose.
Hey sick flairs, my dude
Why do I want Bama to win? I hate Bama.
Absurdity. 
Wow, what a dirty game. Players attacking coaches and everything? The crazy personal fouls? So low of them. 
Refs are the true national champs. Not Georgia, not UCF, and not Bama.
Coming from someone who played QB. He was only watching that outside receiver. Hands in his face, throwing that far outside. It was clearly meant for him. Ridley just did Ridley things. 
Alabama can thank the refs.
Saban definitely didn''t see it. 
Can''t believe Georgia Falcon-ed this shit. 
That's legal when Bama does it tho
I'm just here to break reddit. 
Now this is what I call chaos and salt 
Boneheaded play smh
GG Georgia 
WOW. 
At least force Pappanastos to kick a tough FG. Saban has had bad luck with kickers.
FeelsGeorgiaMan
They had each other's facemasks, and that's the one you call?
Ohhh now, they give a facemask, fuck these refs. 
As a neutral party the ref bias nonsense is really overblown. This crew has been mostly solid. They've made errors no doubt, but as a whole this has been pretty solid 
They need a turnover
It didn't feel like Bama even tried on this drive
There goes the Georgia Falcondogs blowing it.
So was the other missed facemask call.
Hate Bama, but freshman QB seems like a cool dude. What do?
Now they call it
wow, finally a flag ... which puts bama in fg range. no calls until then? really?
Big 10 refs losing Georgia this game. 
So much holding
so now they know what a fucking facemask is. completely ridiculous
Now we are messing it up our selves. 
Tua better get 2 hands on that ball when he's surrounded by defenders. Georgia is not to be trifled with like that. 
These refs are the true freshmen here good god 
Pulling a Georgia Sports ^TM
I wonder if bama fans think they earned this one?
WHY DO I CARE THIS MUCH
oh no Georgia. Can't grab the cage when you start to feel the heat.
Lets face.. This game is a blowout if Tua starts
Don't know why--barring a miracle this is over.
Cough cough Scott Frost cough
This sport is fucking rigged LOL
Death, Taxes, Georgia sports teams blowing massive leads to lose big games. 
Good job getting him out of bounds
Not to mention the pumped in noise that the stadium has built in for Falcons games
Id say it as a St. Louis fan
the 12th man! and the 13th....and the 14th...and...
Now they see a facemask.
AT LEAST 45 yards in missed Alabama calls. But they call the sideline bullshit a weak PI and a facemask on Georgia
Bama kicker sucks.  You have that going for you, GA.
 Biggest flag of the night *so far*
Big mistake going OB right there
ROLL DAMN TIDE
Ouch
This is my fault. I wanted bama to keep it close but not this close
come on D, FUCKING PLEASE
OT?
can confirm
Then call it for both teams.
Buddy D once said that he was so confident that the Saints would never make the Super Bowl that he'd wear a dress and parade around the city if they did.  Buddy died before they got there, so Bobby Hebert picked up that torch and pranced around with it... with thousands of other fans of Buddy and the Saints.
Turning TV off.  The fix has been confirmed.
Definitely a late hit there. 
uga had this. ran out of steam
Huge 3rd down
Holding like fuck #70
Aaron Murray did not age well
Oh, now they want to call personal fouls
Georgia sports curse is realllll
He's done nothing this whole game but miss throws but your entitled to your opinion
I've never liked the whole "offensive players can punch, slam, and yank the helmet, but if you do it it's 15 yards" thing. No idea why a stiff arm to the facemask isn't penalized too. Just as dangerous, IMO.
"Alabama field goal range"My calculator reads "undefined" on that distance 
Refs didn't call the face mask on Bama earlier but they see that one on Georgia?
Oh, so they can call a facemask.
I'm glad all Cincinnati sports teams at all levels suck; I couldn't imagine dealing with this stress. I'd need 5 2mg Xanax.
Alabamas gonna win, aren't they? :(
There was a hand in the face on that run by Bama too...
The Refs remain undefeated and untied. 
I don''t want this game to end on a FG unless it''s glasses kicker
There must be something in that Georgia water that makes their teams choke big leads in big games. #Thoughts&Prayers for Georgia livers tonight. 
Rigged game
Say what you want about the B1G refs having a boner for Alamaba for some reason, but Georgia has been totally out-schemed on both sides of the ball in the second half.
You gotta stay in bounds on that run.
GO DAWGS!
14 having a rough night
Well, 
Refs just pick and choose what calls they want to make...
The poor Georgia sport fans :(
They should have burned some clock instead of stepping out of bounds
Weak
lol this shits over. Another Georgia sports collapse
Fucking  bullshit
Run plays get the first down, try for a touchdown but if 4th down get a field goal. 
WHY WOULD YOU GO OUT OF BOUNDS / RUN A SIDELINE PLAY?!?
I still hate this game for existing but damn it''s what you want in a National Championship, isn''t it?
After how many missed face masks?
They pretty much always give you half a second after it hits 0
Remember when you played the exact same thing an hour ago?
Well, it's been a fun season everybody.    College football is a simple sport. 11 men on offense. 11 men on defense. The defense tries to stop the offense from entering their end zone. And at the end of the day, Alabama wins. 
So. Much. Holding.
let's go Dawgs
Georiga needs to start thinking about using their timeouts 
mark richt has lost control 
Nice
Lol and now they call this facemask...wut.
Going out of bounds was about the best possible thing for UGA there
What the fuck NOW you call a face mask????
Bama has about five of those. This is horseshit.
Oh now they know what a facemask is
You're not wrong, but you're an asshole about it refs. 
all i want is a kick 6
Is the state of Georgia about to have to call out the guard. I feel there could be riots if this happens.
Salt much?
LOL Bama facemasks all night, but they call UGA.
Gg alabama 
Ooooh man that OB could be huge if there's a 3rd down stop...
Bama best play for a touchdown. I don't trust their kicker.
I second that
Same
Accurate flair
I can't imagine what it must be like to be from Georgia and deal with this in every single sport
I don''t think I can hate Bama more than I already do but if they win this game I''ll find a way
I can't watch the NFL because the patriots always win, and now I wont be able to watch CFB because bama always wins. This fucking blows. 
This is the worst timeline.
Shouldve stayed inbounds
FG block return for TD time.
why is bama so disliked 
Nick Satan amirite?
Seriously. Fuck Alabama. 
It's over. Bama gonna win by field goal 
I hate Nick Saban so much
if the offensive player grabs the facemask the defender should be able to on the way down too 
Saban changed the fourth quarter difficulty to freshman
Huehuehue
What a gifted national championship. Selective reffing for sure
Oh interesting, it's only a facemask if Georgia does it.
If I'm Alabama, I'm not betting on my kicker.Fuck that. Get a touchdown.
Dude just got held so fucking bars in front of the ref. This is complete bull shit 
at least bama sucks at kicking sometimes
MEMES START NOW
This is reminding me of the Falcons in the super bowl. Anyone else make that connection?
#ALL YOUR FAULT 
Flair up, dork
Oh it was. But so were the other three earlier in the game 
I hope you are correct. 
These refs man, Alabama doesn't deserve any of this. Fuck these calls.
Man, I can't believe we're getting such a classic to determine who the second-best team in college football is.
Fucking bama man...
Do these refs not know what a hold looks like damn
These fucking Boston refs
Oh shit Facemask!!! It''s over lol. 
Maaaaaan this script suuuuuuucks
are we gonna go to ot
Hoping for this!
No, but it's not over
You guys choked and got rocked by a backup. Get over it 
That's what it looks like. 25 min ago it was a guaranteed win. Now you're a missed tackle away from losing. 
man what is it with football in georgia and blowing leads???
Saban definitely sold his soul. Collection time unknown.
Saban better have a video of all the refs at a furry convention
uncalled hold on that last play
Refs helped
Because they missed literally 3 facemasks on GA earlier
people acting like it's over when UGA has blocked lots of kicks and we know Bama is cursed at kicking
This place is about to riot
Just a complete and utter joke of officiating this game. Ruined. 
Fromm can't hit a 2 yard out for a first down. I mean I know hes been good but...hes definitely shook now
Absolute screw job by these shit refs.
How stressful is this damn
Bama qb looks nervous
I mean that was definitely a face mask. Can't really be mad about that. 
Watching Georgia lose just like OU did, this is the darkest timeline
as close as this game is, horse shit blown calls are a big deal.
Game over man! 
I have never thought refs threw a game until tonight. This is the most egregious thing I've ever seen. 
Join us, Georgia fans. Together, we can rule the galaxy.
Why would you go out of bounds 
They should just let them score here
Bama pls win this
?? Bama didn''t win last year, or the first year of the playoffs 
Georgia's cursed.
Doubtful 
Turns out, you can take Mark Richt out of Georgia, but you can''t take the Georgia out of Georgia.
this thread is going downhill fast so FUCK THE TIDE AND FUCK NICK SABAN
UCF national champions 
I felt that one. And they keep replaying it. I mean stop he''s already dead. 
You should be. I thought y'all were the smart conference./s
Choking runs through Georgia waters.
This game is so trash what is this shit 
The refs didn't do them any favors
It seems you've missed a lot. 
This is about to happen isn't it? Lmao 
Why the fuck you gotta be personal fouling Georgia??? JEEZ 
this is the most poorly officiated game i've ever seen in my entire life. the bama bias is just absolutely unbelievable.
This games over. Georgia is a bunch of chokers
Pretty sure it was all the non calls leading up to this.
You know, they didn't call it earlier?
Georgia, you will never win anything ever again if you lose this game.
Scariest part of this game is that it''s Bama''s freshman making the plays.
Muahahahaha GEORGIA BOUT TO STAY IN 1980
Georgia, you owe it to the college football world... please don't lose at home
“Enough is ENOUGH!!!! I''VE HAD IT WITH THESE MOTHERF@CKING COMMENTATORS AND THIS MOTHERF@CKING FRESHMEN!!!!!!” -Samuel L Jackson
the refs REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
That was much more flagrant than the one they missed. 
Stick your finger in its ass
I wasn't. But Georgia is the Chiefs in this analogy. 
When will coaches learn not to go hyper conservative against Bama or similar teams? Have to keep pushing, not abandon the aggressive play that was working for you
Yeah, this is the B1G officiating I know all too well
Man if georgia chokes... Do they recover?
Ride Bama's dick a little harder, why don't you eh announce team
Going out of bounds there was huge for Georgia
It couldn't have been more blatant
Essentially they're in highschool
for it being college football... yes...
The ref waved his arms over his head tho. 
A true freshman QB is going to win the MVP in one half of football. Unbelievable 
Georgian meltdown part two collegiate bugaloo 
Fuck Bamer
so no time out by georgia?
You have to stay in bounds on that. What in the fuck is Harris thinking?
These refs havent been that bad.  Ya'll just want Bama to lose that badly.
You are not alone but it ain't over yet
This subreddit is so funny when it''s a salt mine. Like ppl need to chill.
bama kicker should fuck it up and we should go to OT 
GG. Disappointed but not surprised. As as tradition. 
freshmen gotta fumble right
There is some serious salt here. 
Yes
Never will call a hold. I don''t get how they see that face mask and not punching Fromm. Whatever
You can hear the collective *"REEEEEEEE"* from this thread every time Alabama gains a yard...
Roll tide
Not like this, after the Falcons debacle, to bama
It was a good call.He problem is they only make the calls for one side 
Gotta love how they miss the 3 or 4 holds a drive for Bama, the OPI, the facemasks, the blocked punt. Georgia was never going to win, lol. Let's be honest.
I mean I saw it
If this was Ohio State/Penn State no one would be watching but SEC means we have to circle jerk it 
OH NO GEORGIA FANS!
I hate alabama
Please, please don't put it on Papa Nasty
Just wanted to drop in and say Roll Tide. 
And all uncalled.
That was an easy face mask but there have been so many no call face masks. There''s the source of the salt.
Georgia would be coasting in this game if Fromm didn't have Ragu in his veins. Guy just got overwhelmed by the spotlight.
The OSU long con. 
Me too.But I think I like it less than seeing Bama lose
it can't end like this, Bama really is the evil empire and the star wars music is so fitting
That TD from TUA was incredible. The vision to see the hole that Ridley was going to is insane. Looked like it was covered but they found the soft spot. It's also incredible how as a backup he has so much chemistry with Ridley. 
Georgia is a disaster on offence
It's a Georgia sports team. Why would you expect anything different?
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Man, Georgia gerogiaing it now :(
I can''t even imagine..... good that has to be awful 
Well that was a mistake 
I'm not being smug, I never trust the fourth quarter
Oh so you DO know what a facemask is.guess you just have to be in the right jersey
Blowing a 13 point lead isn''t as bad as blowing a 25 point lead. Always a bright side 
let them score
Idk why i watch the whole video every time...
Flair up brother 
No.  O want no ref interference 
Well yeah, blatant cheaters getting away with it
It was, but don't call the bama one's though 
Yeah I'm a Titans fan so I'm hoping that's not him haha
If I was a Georgia fan I would be having a brain aneurysm right now
Isn't it enough that Alabama wins all the time? Do they really need to have the games reffed in their favor too? 
 I LOVE LAMP
I''m disgusted. Fuck Alabama. 
That is game 
BUT MUH NARRATIVE
U C FCF
And that's the game
It''s happening
PA rollout with a short safe pass, then kick a FG if you don''t get it.
Wide open for him
Saban tracked down a virgin at half time to sacrifice rough task in That stadium.  
I''m tempted to say Georgia needs to just let them score. They''re already in fg range and they NEED to answer
fuckkkkk
Fuck I feel bad for Georgia 
My god I hate bama. 
Now they call a facemask? How biased are these refs tonight? 
That terrible PI was just hearbreaking to watch. What an idiot. 
ESPN will be unwatchable for a month if Bama pulls this off. Slurp, slurp, slurp
These poor sports fans. My god, no championships for Georgia.
no one is saying it wasn't. people are saying the calling has been utterly inconsistent.
Nope just have to call luck when I see it
Reminder: Only offensive players with the ball can jam their hands into the opposing players facemask
We need a miracle, a turnover here defense, come on!
Feel bad for GA fans
/r/BamaConspiracy
So take back 2 touchdowns due to refs and uga would win
It was but so was Bama's earlier.
Oh shut it. It's not about whether that was a facemask. It's about the fact that UGA got none of those calls this game
Georgia blowing the lead to the patriots of CFB in Atlanta''s stadium is poetic 
Georgia got to conservative
ballgame
how are people mad at that facemask call lmao
That's it. Game over
OH you fucking bullshit piece of shut officials can see that face mask. 
First down!
Bama, saving Tua for last
LETS GO BAMA!!!!!
I knew this would happen. I just fucking knew it. 
Is it to early to start #notmynationalchampion ?
Id be calling timeouts if I was Georgia
lol
Who has the balls to call a hold with under 2 left to play 
Hey, We've still got United.
Andddd thats game. 
Game over
Tua is giving the middle finger to all of r/CFB. Hate us cause they ain''t us 
When the game started I thought I wanted Georgia to knock off the evil empire. Once they took a nice lead, I realized that I wanted Bama to come back at the end of the game and break their hearts. All going according to plan...
Because UGA fans have been so unbearable on here
Class, bro. Get some. 
Tide Tempo. Just end me. 
Dear Georgia, we know what it's like to lose on a last-second FG to a team from Alabamawe commiserate with thee
I think 'Bama just won...
I hate Bama but I'm from Cleveland and a huge Cavs fan, so as much as it hurts me, they need to win
fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck
gg 
Ohhhh, the player needs to be out of bounds for a facemask to count.  Got it.  
game over.
It's a game of who chokes more, Bama kickers or the entirety of Georgia.
Georgia to have a blood feud with the entire Big10 conference
Ballgame
Game over barring a missed short range FG
this is true
Don't blow this Georgia. 
YOOOO THE BALLS ON THIS KID
Leave it to a team from Georgia to get conservative way too early in a championship game and choke away their lead...
Fuckin'' A
Classless team gonna win
Guess I'm not getting Bama by 5.5
has there been one major penalty on bama all game?
That's game
gotta hope for a missed fg now
holy shit this kid is the real deal.
Why won't Georgia hand the ball to Todd Gurley?
I''m first half Jim Chaney and I have direct tvI''m second half Jim Chaney and I wear clean ex boxes as shoes 
This entire thread turning into salt pillars right now. One last glimpse at the glory that once was Sodom and Gomorrah before it burns 
Happened at TSU dude gave his coach a haymaker and knocked him out on the sidelines 
no way dude. 
Time for the Clemson screen pass 
Cause then UCF.
This has to be a con job."Oh, he didn't get the first down... doesn't matter that he threw the ball away from everyone to waste time. FACE MASK! It's a first down now."It WAS indeed a facemask, but you cannot wait that long to throw a flag in this game.
That's your ballgame right there.
Do you think Jalen hurtz is excited about winning the national championship? 
Game
wow that was powerful
Sam Darnold wouldn''t have it any other way 
That's game son
I don't think we have a right to comment on choking after what happened in our bowl game. Haha :(
God damn choke artists 
Cfb should be ashamed of how the fix is in for the refs.
congrats bama lol. jesus fucking christ another year
What the heck defensive formation was that? 
Georgia goes out with a whimper.
C'mon dawg friends!
*unless you have Deshaun Watson
True Freshmen
 This is the most likely scenario to make me break my tv.
Game
Najee gonna get the game sealing TD.
rip
Well unless the kicker screws up again, this is over
And that''s ball game.
R.i.p
That's game.
That was blatant as fuck lmao FOH
No. Texas/USC 2006 is what you want in a national championship game.
Epic collapse.  The Atlanta Falcons would be proud.
God I hope Bama's kicker misses the kick just because he's Bama kicker
He didn't even elude the dude...the dude just...the dude just *tripped*. God hates Georgia sports
I'm bracing for the inevitable now.
This game is gonna end like Auburn Oregon
Gg
Tua is a fucking beast.
Tom Brady right now:*"EXCELLENT!!!"*
Georgia got tackled by their facemask twice before this in the 3rd quarter and there was no call
It's like when the whole country was cheering against New England and they won the Super Bowl again, but like...Actually it's the exact same.
Should be obvious what I think of those guys. Des Moines is full of wannabe hipsters who get off on complaining. 
We really calling that a punch tho?
Remember the blocked punt that wrongly got called offsides?  I have a feeling Georgia will remember it with even more anger than remembering Sherman's march to the sea.
This game is pointless. UCF are national champs
Well, that's game, barring a miracle
Game
I fucking hate this 
Yep
Someone just got their job taken lol
im rooting for OT
https://i.imgur.com/bYfb1tb.png
They always show the kicker warming up...
I agree with you on that, if its not clear. I just don't think some of the people calling it a weak/bad call are right. That was a clear facemask, as was the previous ones. It should be called in all cases.
I mean, I can think of two with the one you just brought up and the facemask. That's hardly handing the game to Alabama.
Georgia, damn, this defense is getting abused. 
That''s the game 
Bama winning by kicking a FG would be unexpected.
GG. Sorry for the refs Georgia
GG rip Georgia 
Kirby gonna take any TO?
There are no virgins in Tuscaloosa. 
Does this come down to a Bama FG?
Georgia is in some deep shit right now
Man Harbaugh took 2 injuries to finally start our 2nd year qbMeanwhile Saban just throwing out a true freshman at halftime and coming back to win the national title.Seriously this man needs to retire he is just that much better than every other coach
Just think that this is the 2nd time in a year that a lot of these fans have seen their team blow a commanding lead in the 4th.
That's game.
#DO NOT PASS 
MILK THAT SHIT
Pretty much. 
Lol stfu
Oh fuck you refs. This is the most one sided reffing I''ve ever seen. You kill UGA momentum with two horrendous calls then give a soft face mask to Alabama on a fourth down drive? Are you fucking kidding?
Tua "literally Russell Wilson" Tagavsglrjgseorgjsoegjua
Did that dude just TRIP?
That new Bama QB is a stud
RIP
So which infraction gets bama flair downvoted this year?So many choices guys. Let's at least mix it up this year. 
Bama gifted a playoff spot and now being gifted the game.  Got away with everything all night and Georgia got blasted with ticky tacky penalties.
Georgia will need a block or a miss to have any chance. 
Alabama your offense of line has held every play since the start of the 2nd half with not one flag. Take the win but anyone who knows football knows you sucks ass lol
a FRESHMAN just ran over a SENIOR
Ball game. No OT tonight. 
These refs better have police escorts straight out of Georgia tonight.
Really stupid not to let bama score
Still haven't figured out why Tua didn't start all year. 
Tua "Earl Campbell" Tagovaiola
Georgia sucking it up big time
The state of Georgia is not allowed to have nice things
God damn member when the refs took away a blocked punt. I sure as fuck remember 
Refs miss a delay of game and it's now snowballing in Bama's favor.
Haha so Bama can just do anything they want, as soon as Georgia does it the refs are on top of it. What is this inconsistency?
Yes 
That's Ricardo to you good sir
True freshman too 
Why do I like this 
wow ... well that was a lame ass half georgia. 
Tua took this game over. Not ready for Iron Bowls in the near future. 
Too late 
I like that go get em attitude
you know with alabamas kicking history they might miss a fg from this distance
I can't believe GA blew this game
sigh...
[tonight's theme song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1umEXpGHc0E)
Tagovolia is gonna have a lot of that sex tonight!
Throw in refs and it turns to garbage.
Where's the buffalo wild wings button? 
Safe now unless they miss the kick!
A whole season of upsets being wasted before our eyes. 
This is how the dog was kil...by refs and tide
I feel like there's gonna be a brawl at the end of this game
I swear if Bama wins, it's going to be Bama Evil Empire confirmed...  Annually.
lmao this is hilarious
Kicker will 100% not choke, Bama 100% wins no hope for the Dawgs. Literally impossible for them to win now.
Bama freshman qb just sealed the natty by trucking a Georgia defender. For fuck sake
The refs really fucking did this? Are you kidding me?
Damn this Quarterback out here trucking defenders.
might as well get a TD, need that over
Knowing that you have to watch the falcons do this next week. Ouch
BAMA BOUT TO WIN. =( I WANTED BOTH TO LOSE.
DELAY OF GAME
Sad Georgia fans give me life. 
*Looks At Flair*I believe you.
Appreciate it. Can''t watch the game, so when I checked the stats I saw some other guy. I  Was hoping hurts wasn''t injured.  
Imagine the scenes if Georgia wins on a blocked FG returned for a TD
Hurts is a class act. I feel bad for him, but Tua is lit.
Tua, so slippery and powerful. True freshman. 
No wonder ratings are going down. Who wants to watch the refs hand the team everyone hates the game?
UCF
That's game. Like it was scripted 
the only holding penalty this entire game was on a punt return.... yea, i think these refs left their glasses at home
Holy cow that is one major collapse Georgia.
THEY CANT KEEP GETTING AWAY WITH THIS. 
It was inevitable.
Fuck you UGA for getting my hopes up
Wow. Alabama is going to do it again.
It's over 
Rip Georgia sports 
The most annoying things is these announcers won''t say a thing about the shit refs- just about how good Bama has been. Jfc 
This really reminds me of the Ravens vs 49ers superbowl. The refs rigged it when it looked like it was going to be a blow out, and Bama came roaring back. 
"Thank you for your bets."-eSECpn
Idk. Georgia could've...you know....picked up a first down or two late in the game.
Najee Harris is such a cool name. It feels like he's been an all pro for 10 years. 
GG
Last time the national championship game went to overtime was 2003.  Ohio State beat Miami 31-23 in 2OT in the BCS championship Fiesta Bowl.
And deep down in your heart, you know the Patriots are going to win the super bowl this year too
Wow passive play calling lost Georgia this game 
Alabama fans: do you understand now why everyone despises your team?
57 needed better cleats
fuck
That's it bama just wrapped it upunless they miss the kick
And a legend was born 
But is he a true freshman? Can we get a ruling?
Pretty sure literally everyone is going to make that connection. 
It overEdit: oh my
Ok UCF, you're my national champs now
[Bottom of the Screen Wide Receiver jumps off-sides on Bama's touchdown](https://twitter.com/JimmyTraina/status/950589387770916870)
That should be game barring anything crazy. 
Never trust a Georgia team. Also, fuck Bama.
Thanks Chaney
Why go out of bounds. 
And he misses
Fuck Alabama, fuck Nick Saban, fuck these refs, and fuck #48
Put the biggest asterisk possible on this shit
I'd like to congratulate the 2018 national champions, UCF and the Big Ten officiating crew!
THE WILDCAT KILLED GEORGIA
Pure Athenian wisdom right there 
Annnnd thats game
Guys, Tua might be a better QB than Hurts
I feel last minute fuckery coming on. 
I wonder what Darnold thinks about this game so far.
THEY CANT KEEP GETTING AWAY WITH THIS
This is the worst
You monster
You''re acting like that doesn''t happen in some way in almost every program. I agree he should have been punished but in a championship game? 
GG Georgia, UCF Knights are still *MY* national champion
The team that prob shouldn't even got in is about to win it all
Damn First down
Good game Georgia. Sorry dog bro''s 
Cant believe Georgia choked this game away
The refs have been terrible. Can't believe Georgia is gonna lose 
state of georgia no on suicide watch
I think Bama's gonna blow it. I just feel it in my bones.
Don't Walsh it kicker.
Fuckin hell Bama's gonna win after all the chaos aren't they
Can't believe you choked Georgia. Oh wait I actually can 
they will score a TD easy here. Game over. 
All over but the kick. 
Your team didnt help...
fuck this stupid game
Not a great year for georgia sports, the falcons choke the superbowl, the braves GM gets banned for life and they lose all their prospects, and UGA is maybe gonna choke
They can't keep getting away with this!!!
Papa Nasty x3???Fuck, just jinxed him didn't I? 
god damn georgia fucking sucks
With a head coach who coached under belichick
Blew it 
whelp, that's pretty much ball game
welp that's game
Nah it was #48 he sacrificed
Just dont watch.
Agreed. I don't really like rooting for Bama, but the faces of angry UGA fans are giving me so much schadenfreude that it's almost worth it.
Why do they never just let them score? Higher probability of going down and scoring yourselves than stopping points from happening here. 
Georgia fucking blew it. Great
HERE COMES THE CURSE OF THE FALCONS
just a heads up, i'm going to murder the person who posts the "is kill" meme in the post game thread. That is all. 
Someone call Bdubs about this field goal.
Idiot goes out of bounds. 
I believe
This sport is so freaking dumb
Game. Dammit.
Not saying it wasn't a penalty. But the refs haven't been consistent at all. They flag that but not when punches are thrown? 
She has a very naked instagram
Nick Saban is 66 and this is his 6th national title. We've got 666 right there boys, officially confirmed he is indeed the devil. 
Georgia and falling apart in the 4th, name a more iconic duo.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTE-1K0lppcGeorgia right now.
Refs vs UCF- the ultimate national champion showdown.
Who let Richt back on the sidelines? 
Classic Georgia
Oh boy I love this salt.
Well Georgia has lost. How did this happen? 
[deleted]
So what happens to Hurts after this game?
DAE TRUE FRESHMAN
Bye bye Jalen Hurts.
My chiefs tried to compete
Feels like their entire lineup is freshmen. Najee Harris, Jerry Jeudy, Henry Ruggs, Alex Leatherwood, Tua, etc. - that's just offense. FFS we are all screwed
i seent it
As an impartial observer, this Freshman QB from Bama is quite a story. What a fun player to watch 
the entire state of Georgia on suicide watch. poor Georgia 
This is like watching the villain rise back up and go around killing everybody, then there's ominous music and that's the end.
I smell an interception coming. 
We still love u
 Believe he''s good enough to play somewhere else if he loses his spot which I think he did.
Many are probably Hawks fans as well... fuck.
RIP UGA fans
Game. GG. Georgia is the state of chokers. Fuck everything.
Slippery Freshman who use the head >>>
Fuck these refs so hard
I'm just here for the salt. This is truly the best timeline.
Just standard saban blackmagicfuckery
This isn''t goin into OT...
No, I want better officiating. 48 should have been ejected for the punch and not able to be on the field to blow up the return man, missed holds and facemasks everywhere.
Oh my god I just realized there are a ton of UGA fans who are also Falcons fans
Wow... I feel really sorry for those dual-Georgia/Atlanta football fans.  Both games felt like they were written for you to have your heart stomped in.
what the fuck way to choke Georgia
I hate Bama, but I like this Tua kid.
GG lol
Johnny tsunami looks like trubiski 
god hates us all
Blocked punt would have still been dead with false start
I've never seen anything like this. It's wild.
Oooooo another interesting one. That'd build so much hype. 
Hold them here Dawg brethren 
It's over. Refs made sure of it. All this fucking work and it comes down to refs
I can't really blame them. The people who are 100% serious about paid refs are laughable but I'd be so salty all the same the way penalties have been called.
Usually hesitant to blame the refs, but nearly every shitty call went against Georgia. Hard not to be bitter as a Georgia fan 
I like how Alabama doesn't stiff srm they punch the facemask
lol Georgia
The face mask that was ignored?The holding on two different lineman on the 4th down td? 
The salt at a bama win is going to be incredible
Can't rely on Papanasty though?
Is this what's its like to root for Bama? Oh my
:(
You disgust me
Hopefully this championship will be enough for Saban to retire.
If Alabama wins I'll actually drink Tide
Calling it now: blocked FG returned for a TD
Backup freshman QB in the championship game. That's amazing you have to admit
The amount of salt is magnificent. I feel like a piece of shit lol
Eh. Not soft.
Bama O line playing like shit.Saban:  Just hold them they won't call it on us.
Now block the field goal and return it for 6 
Dive, dive, FG.. let's hope the kicker chokes 
Go dawgs grata Bama I'm out of this thread. Till next year folks peace and love
what a choke
That''s what I''m thinking.
It's the obvious missed face mask on Bama earlier that makes that call so insane, not the call itself
Can you imagine being a freshman and coming into a national championship game you didn't expect to play in and lead a comeback to possibly win...jesus
I just learned my Reddit feed is about 2 minutes ahead of my TV coverage, because everyone was talking about this facemask. Took 3 plays for it to finally happen 
I wonder if I''ll get in trouble for running down to bama real quick and FUCKING PUNCHING SABAN IN THE FACE. Trash
Roll tide!
Why are you surprised. You''re the Patriots of college football
Oh my God most of these people are Falcons fans too. Did y'all take a shit on a picture of Jesus or something?
its over
I hate Bama but dam. That's impressive.
Well that's game and a choke
I am sorry Georgia fans, you deserved better than these B1G refs who wanted Alabama to win
I like the Georgia defender that decided to tackle a ghost instead of the QB
UGA smart enough to let them score or do they trust Bama K to miss again?
THEY CANT KEEP GETTING AWAY WITH THIS 
saban and satan are one letter apartthis is probably a coincidence, but goddangit they can't keep getting away with this
the amount of salt from non bama fans is hilarious. go take a nap. 
#LONG LIVE TUUUAAAAA
So many calls in favor of Alabama. What a shit game.
CFB should be ashamed that Bama made the playoffs
Sure seems like it.
That pass interference last drive was straight BS. Sad you guys have to lose the championship based on poor judgment calls
God, I fucking hate Alabama...
GG no re
Think of all the Falcons/UGA fans... 
Lol gonna come down to another Bama field goal kicker.It's not over Georgia!
Random ass QB comes in trailing multiple scores and saves the day. Fuck you Bama you slippery fucks. GG
Honestly if we win, I really feel bad for the Dawgs. It''s been a rough few years in sports, seems like they''re due something good.
Ahem. Roll Tide
Would be cooler in blue.
Georgia gonna need another fg block
Everyone saying it's over forgets alabamas kicking problems
It's gotta be the highest probability chance for Georgia now.
https://i.imgur.com/A0dhKim.jpg
All about that action, boss.
Cleveland should just relocate to Georgia so we can confine all sports misery to 1 state
Lol UGA with a huge choke job
The state of Georgia is cursed
fucking bama. 
Bama MVP: Zebras
refs like Bama a bit
UGA is 2/7 on 3rd in the 2nd half
Yeah NOW they call it. This game was given to Bama. There is literally no debating it lol. 
ITS NOT FUCKING OVER YOU MORONS 
Because when Alabama did it just as blatantly it wasn't called
This isn't happening
UCF
The state of Georgia should just quit sports
choke
This is a wonderful game if you enjoy football. 
FRESHMAN!In case it wasn't said enough.
Gg bama has won this. Hope they send some rings to the refs 
Oh now they start calling things
Refs for Bama MVP.
Man, wtf is wrong with you? What made you hurt so bad?
Things I learned this year.1. Always bet against Georgia teams in championship games.2. Skip your conference championship game to give yourself some extra rest for the playoffs. 
Run clock down and kick.
I am just here for the SEC salt at the end
This is some 2006 iowa bowl game levels reffing. Worse than 2017 farmageddon.
All of this turns when Tua escapes and scrambles for that first down on the first TD. That doesn't happen and who the hell knows.
I live in Georgia but don''t root for UGA. This is gonna be so sweet when they lose 
I hope the refs get player of the game. They deserve it. They really pulled it out for Bama. 
Kirby choked. Everybody with a lead against Bama chokes except Auburn 
How is that not a hold on 82?
Kicker just needs to make it and that''s it. 
For real. Win now or that's it. 
What about ja rule? 
It makes me cringe so hard just reading it
GEORGIA FUCKING DO SOMETHINGGGG REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
All down to the kicker now. If I''m Georgia I save the timeouts and freeze him, can''t hurt to make him think about it more.
/r/CFB knows no king, but the king in the South, who''s name is UCF. 
I'm sorry Georgia fans. I literally started watching two minutes into the 4th quarter. It's been downhill from there.
Do the refs get the MVP?
Nice eye gouge
It wasn't GA. You know this. I know this. Everybody knows this.
Falcons get Belicik'd. Bulldogs get Saban'd. I didn't believe in the Georgia sports curse til now. I feel for you Bulldogs. This sucks to watch. 
r/cfb in shambles
The game isn't over yet girls
Tua may not be the biggest, but he sure as fuck runs like he is. 
Basically need to let them score. We cant stop the clock enough to have time to go back
Game over.
why do i even watch sports
Just a complete meltdown by Georgia.How do you let this happen? 
Yep, looking like That's the dagger there for Georgia. Unless the Alabama kicker miss the kick like earlier in the game, they'll be your next National Champions
#fuck my face
No one Georgia's better than us. Imma go kill myself now.
He didn't really run over him guys
Mine too
Is anyone really surprised? Every season feels the same. It's not even fun to watch anymore.
I think the state of Georgia's just cursed tbh.
This game will be remembered for Saban playing a player after he assaulted a coach, and the refs gifting Alabama 14 points. 
Holy crap Georgia.   Just let em score and get the ball back quick 
The refs have made some shitty calls but this QB deserves mad credit. He is in there giving it all and slinging the rock.
Georgia sports curse is real.
I mean, the Bills drafted Nathan Peterman so I guess anything is possible.
Gotta just let them score on this play and go for OT. 
*Cries in R&B*
Damn can't escape 28-3 here either:(
Name a more iconic duo.
That PI call tho...
Georgia why
Where is 1st half Georgia did they get locked in the locker room? 
this is depressing 
ESPN is unapologetically sucking Alabama's collective dick right now.
Kinda like how Browns fans get used to being perpetual doormats, Atlanta/Georgia fans are used to perpetual blue balls.
What a choke job by Georgia, yeesh 
Tua is actually Uub from Dragon Ball Z.  
I mean that's game right?
The refs have been good this game especially for a college game.
They HURTS his feelings for sure. 
Yup! Definitely don't want OT
I kinda find it harder to hate Bama for this than the refs
Nobody is enjoying this. Especially after the way bama''s players acted in the third quarter. 
.
...and Alabama will win this game in the final minute, make an exciting game/season boring, and kill the dreams of everyone for another year.But OH COLLEGE FOOTBALL HAS PARITYEat my ass. 
Saban hoping Georgia coaches interfere with another play and he swings on them
We're well past that.
We all do
Refs and Bama shenanigans.
Transfer imo
I hate bama, but like this Tua kid. So idk. Roll tide I guess.
If you're Georgia at this point why not just let them score a TD? Better than Bama kicking a FG with no time left
Man, damn Georgia, you like, had this game in the bag.
Well Georgia, you tried 
Can't we just have ONE game without bringing him up????!!!
Existence is pain for a Georgia sports fan.
Shows how ridiculous it is that a stiff arm to the face is okay when a tackle by one isn''t. Getting grabbed and shoved in the face mask caused the reciprocal face mask, but the CB ends up penalized for it. 
Looks like Georgia got a whiff of Nebraska's No More Tackle Serum
Damn me for giving Bama advice and they win the game.... 
Papa is gonna finish us all
Goddammit Georgia
Hey georgia...https://streamable.com/2jkcj
A miracle, a blocked kick, a fumble, something here please Dawgs! 
Well, whoever scores the most points is gonna win.
Will it come down to the Bama kicker...
In less than one year, Atlanta fans have gone through hell with SB 51 and now this.
CHOOOKEE
good game 
When the QB starts running the ball like a RB...damn.
Running like Bortles out there.
Game 
Transfers to Georgia
Gg georgia, you should have came prepared to play two teams tonight instead of one. 
I do not have enough Tums for the heartburn this game is giving me.
Bama needs a TD, I would NOT rely on there kicker. Uhhh yeah fuck that hahahaha.
I should have known better than to count on a Georgia team to win a championship game.
He was two yards from the first on a first. That face mask did not swing the game at all. 
Bama is almost guaranteed to win with the refs handing the game to them
"no"
Saban will say he didn't know. There's no fucking way a coach didn't tell him a player swung on a coach. Fuck Saban
Why do Georgia sports always let me down
dont bother calling that eye gouge
But he's a shit NFL coach whereas harbaugh was a good one 
It appears he''s worried he didn''t sacrifice enough goats to the Devil before the game. 
For that to happen we must send this to OT. I'm behind this 
Meanwhile Georgia-based suicide hotline staffers are frantically racing to their offices.
This is the most intense battle to decide the national runner up in a long time.
Did Tua try to poke that Georgia dude in the eyes?
Well at least Georgia still has the thrashers am I rite? 
Wow it's actually gg
The ole use the head as a battering ram technique.
Living in Montgomery, I think I''m about to get to play a few good rounds of ‘Gunshot or Fireworks'' from my back porch 
A combination of Alabama black magic and garbage officiating.
Against Bama? Nah
Did Tua try to poke Georgia players eye?
Well boys, it was a lot of fun watching the refs play for Alabama all night. 
Made into hamburger and glue
Georgia sports curse in full effect.
Game isn't over. Bama hasn't had the best kicking team.
Jalen Hurts 0-2 in the National Championship game
Strong true freshman
Wow Georgia teams really know how to choke.
Its nice he's a freshman and all that but he hasn't done a fucking things without the refs taking them by the hand to the red zone
Keep in mind Papadoakoaknreoalaous needs to put it between the uprights....its not over 
Probably transfers
Dude you knew you were going to win and lookey there you won. STOP PRETENDING YOU DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE GOING TO WIN 
God damn stream fucking up near the end of the game...
UCF!
Bama gonna kick a FG to win number 6. Sabah made a deal with the devil confirmed. 
'grats UCF
Harbaugh is just that bad
Yeeees, let the hate flow through you... 
What happens if Alabama's kicker misses? 
Goddamn Georgia where the fuck did the offense go? Ya'll became inept after the half and Bama just starting doing Bama things.
Right before the facemask that wasn't.
 Whoever sells alcohol in Georgia is about to make alot of money.
How drunk are you?
N E B R A S K AEBRASKA
I didn''t buy into the UCF champs meme but if bama wins after this game, I''m hopping on the bandwagon
This was over hours ago when the refs took over. Absolutely embarrassing. 
Did malcolm parrish literally lose the game for da dawgs or what
This shit is too funny
And done
Football gonna be canceled in Gerogia
[deleted]
[deleted]
Yeah I'm salty. This game sucked. GG Bama+Refs.
Its not over yet... a couple of plays for a loss, or a holding penalty puts them on the edge of FG range. 
Damn, Alabama gonna win it now huh...
RIP
He''s made his ritual sacrifices that''s for sure
Why do I even watch football anymore. The amount of flags that fuck over one team is sickening and ruins the flow of the game.
52 just took himself out
Not a true Georgia fan, still having one. 
You guys have the 73rd best Super Smash Bros. Melee player in the world. So at least you have that going for you.
You can also see everyone cheering for bama ignore the blatant bullshit they''re benefiting from
He is finna \#CometothefaU
It's over. He was never going pro either.
*yawn* Another Alabama win, and this is why I shouldnt even bother with these games anymore.
Atlanta doing what they do best in championship games!! CHOKING!
Humble yourselves Georgia 
I''m so fucking hurt man 
He poked him in the eye lol
Jesus christ Georgia, you were the chosen one. Another Georgia team blowing a 2nd half lead. You poor poor bastards.... 
They can't keep getting away with this
FUCK MY LIFE
3rd down defense. A strength in the 1st half, a weakness in the 2nd.
georgia's secondary has balled out today
Is Bobby Williams Virgil to Nick Saban's Ted Dibiase?
[removed]
Georgia football fans have it rough
These holds are unreal
Some guy called a pick-six in the first quarter.
Lol, a freshman quarterback came in after Halftime and NEUTERED DEM DAWGGGZZZ!!!!!!! 
Can we fuck
at least call the holding on 70, dude looks like me trying to unhook my first girlfriend's bra.
I'm sorry Georgia but you really Georgia'd this game. We were all counting on you guys.
Georgia blew their load last week by going to overtime against Oklahoma.  They're out of gas now.  They're done.
Georgia pls, you were the chosen one
hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
Now starting, for your 2019 Auburn Tigers: Jalen Hurts!
Samoan strength
welp thats game
No, but you can be mad about the 2 obvious face masks (at least), unsportsmanlike conducts, and other personal fouls by 'bama.Edit: not to mention all the holds.
I NOW RECOGNIZE UCF AS CHAMPION!
First there was 28-3. Now we have the 13-0.
Yeah man, refs handed this game over. No fun watching this game.
Billie Kay and Peyton Royce
if they win the game they deserve it
Whoever sells alcohol in Georgia is about to make alot of money.
Bro I can't imagine being a falcon and georgia fan
Bama gonna set record for Gyros sold in a day tomorrowOr maybe pineapple pizzas
What an awful and arguably undeserved ending to an otherwise fun game.
Refs have stock in Walmart T-shirts obviously.
Yessir!!
Who cares I don't even like fooseball, just a bunch of hunks anyways
I feel terrible for football fans in Atlanta/Georgia
Falcons just happy the state will be on suicide watch for someone else''s choke job 
this sub on suicide watch
UCF vs Bama is gonna be lit!!
RIP JALEN HURTS
bama
now how do we feel about calling UCF national champs
Did I stay up for this?
Roll Tide! 
hahahahahahaha
Nah, I'm enjoying it.
Part of me wants a missed FG but also don;t want him to be scarred for life. 
Ah damn. 
No holding called all since ever
Is this the new "death and taxes?"
Well at least UCF is still champion
Don''t worry, they won''t kill Bama''s momentum wIth commercials
Well guys, 1 minute left of college football  (probably). It's been real.
This game is wrapped up and gifted to Bama with this absolute one sided officiating in the 2nd half. But all they'd talk about is Tua.
WELP LOOKS LIKE UCF ARE MY NATIONAL CHAMPS
"Jalen who?"-Announcers
Lol Georgia football teams
what the fuck
[Georgia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5RtlpXsl8k)
Eye gouge?
This is disappointing
Hawaii !!!!!!  
Love finger
His lock on the starting role Hurts after this game.
Alabama will miss the kick tho
Bama has gotten every 50 50 call tonight. 
No UGA. I didn''t pull for y''all this season for this to happen. 
Alabama didn't win this game. Georgia lost it.
Alabama doesn't have to score a touchdown in that scenario so it's just making the FG easier. Saban would tell the running back or whoever to take a knee at the 1
We get rid of him once and for all. Or move him to <insert>back.
Congrats, Georgia. In 53 seconds you will have disappointed the entire world. 
Georgia do something!
It's like I'm watching a brand new team out there. Jesus, that Bama QB and RB are both trucks. 
Hurts to FAU?
If Bama wins who starts at qb next year?
Their second half play calling didn't help either, but ya, the reffing was pretty crap.
Tennessee and Dumpster Fire?
Lol Bama bout to win this game on winning the face mask call odds 
20-7
Some band is playing “Fortress of Solitude” from the Superman soundtrack. 
This is why you don''t take your foot off the gas in the fast lane.
Georgia and choking. Name a more iconic duo
No credit to Tua or Bama. Just the refs I guess, eh? 
Still don''t understand how losing your conference gets you into the playoffs. 
Apparently the Atlanta sports curse has spread to Athens
Anyone said a Falcon joke yet?! I''m original 
Block that fucking kick
Close to delay of game a couple times.
Never forget 
Dude CFB has far less parity than the NFL, you're just now deciding it is too predictable?
Georgia just letting Bama fall ass backwards to this title. Not surprised really 
God fucking damnit. It's always the Black and Red teams in the big games. Never bet on them, apparently.
YouTube TV free trial. I think it buffered once during halftime. 
Please
Football was a mistake. I'm certain of this now. Let's never play it again.
I fucking hate bama and I fucking hate Georgia for not beating themEDIT : REDACTED HAHAHHAHAHAHAHHA FUCK BAMA OVERTIME BABY
Lol, Jalen Hurts position on wiki was changed to *BENCHED*
Tua tagovailoa is shifty as fuck 
they said his whole family moved
I already knew what would happen. I turned the game off already lol
This kid Tua is the real deal!! Hurts is going to need a transfer next year! 
Hands in the face on that block? No call!
So I guess it wasn't Richt's fault after all?
Remember the three players who should have been called for a false start on that play, rendering it a moot point as the block never would have happened anyways? Anyone who wants the blocked punt to stand doesn't want even officiating, they want Georgia to get the help that they're criticizing Bama for getting.
Captain Insaneo shows no mercy. 
The Patriots and Alabama are compared to each other quite a bit already. If Alabama ends up winning this, the similarities are just going to get crazy
Tenn and Butch
This is an instant tainted-classic that we'll all remember very bitterly as a reminder of the refball effect.
Great. Now I'm going to have to listen to some fucking fake Alabama fan say roll tide to me all day at work tomorrow. So God damn annoying.
Tua is a legend if he wins this. True freshman coming in because your starting quarterback who is 25-2, decided to suck it up. 
They're gonna get Tua killed lol
RIP THE BALL OUT
I don't care what you all are saying, this has been a well officiated game. People just frustrated calls are going in favor of Bama.
Don't overestimate a jittery kicker
TUA THE TRUTH
Georgias only chance is the kicker choking. He might..
Saban and his voodoo magic. His assistants are 0-11 soon to be 0-12 against him
The QBs crosses are gone. Nick saban confirmed deal with the devil 
Good try Georgia. You put up a better fight than we did. 
Could be worse. Or not, who knows. 
RMFT
[removed]
Tebow.
They're busy calling each other.
Missed face mask forced a UGA punt. You can argue for the purity of heart or some bullshit, but to lose from a well called game gives closure. This isn't that game
At least Ohio State is the king of the north. Georgia got red weddinged. And UCF is the Targaryens
Said it before and I'll say it again - not even a win justifies Bama getting into the playoff in the first place. If the Patriots lose in the divisional round, they don't get to be in the Super Bowl because a team of elites think they're "still the best team, even though they couldn't even win their division". Way to fuck the pooch on this one Georgia. 
[deleted]
ESPN's streaming is shockingly bad
Fucking zebras
Who would win? The entire University of Georgia or one Hawaiian true freshman boi
Kirby is fucking frustrated to have it end like this. 
National* Champions^*Excluding ^SEC ^West
Hhaha this is the most Georgia thing ever
47 yards in the 4th quarter and UGA fans think the refs are the only reason for blowing this lead.....
Well, the good thing about this is Skip Bayless hates Nick Saban, so at least he'll be disappointed.
Saban playing 4D Chess.
Hahaaha these refs calling something on Bama? Fucking hilarious 
People talking about an all SEC championship is the darkest timeline. How about a Bama comeback with a freshman QB in the all SEC Championship timeline?
Georgia teams and blowing big leads in important games. Name a more iconic duo
Good stop cmon Georgia
Never visiting Georgia, a meteor is next. 
god damn it, this is going to come down to bama's special teams. i need a drink. 
> Always bet against Georgia teams in championship games.This ain't new baby.  
Only will believe this if he disappears in smoke during the postgame ceremony
Scott Frost = Night King
Mark Richt has lost control of the Georgia lockerroom.
Fucking hell, Georgia bros. 
What is it with Georgia football teams blowing commanding leads late into 2nd half?
GG REFS 
OH BOY I AM SO IMPRESSED THAT A FRESHMAN THAT IS 2ND STRING QB AT BAMA KNOWS HOW TO PLAY FOOTBALL
Hey guys, did you know that the Alabama qb did not have meaningful snaps before this game?!
Looks like Bama playing to kick?
Yes, that's what can happen with a playoff system 
Come on 48, punch someone else
UGA needs to be trying to strip the ball. That is probably their best bet because blocking a FG likely won't happen.
We can''t let this game distract us from the true CFB champs, UCF.
Why does Georgia only have one timeout left anyway? WTF did they use the other 2 on?
They can't keep on getting away with it!
Is UGA not out of timeouts yet feel like theyve had 5
Can the Cleveland Browns beat Georgia?
RIP Georgia 
Looked like he knee''d his helmet too.
Oh god, I didn't even think about that...These poor people..
Bad refs but Georgia coaching was kinda shit
Georgia sports looking to strike again
The memes write themselves 
Come on Gators, get up and go 
I mean not to discredit Tua and Bama for that matter because they have played well but Georgia has been fucking jobbed by the refs this half.
"please score a td. Please score a td." me if I was Alabamas kicker. 
I am
id die from the hard-on
Homeboy through Hell new band name called it 
Doesn't matter, after a bunch of productive games as a starter, he'll just replace him with a true freshman backup
The team that didn't even deserve to be in the playoff won the National Championship, God is a huge troll
I'd call in sick. 
I'm gona pretend you understand football for a second and remind you they beat #1 Clemson who has a defense with at least 5 first round picks on it.
Georgia sports be cursed 
It's been a rough year for the state of Georgia in terms of championship football. 
except GT fans and Alabama devil worshipers 
 Nah
Rulemakers hate defense
Roll Tide!
Georgia''s shitty second half offense cost them big time.
TUA GETTING LAID TONIGHT
Dammit UGA way to break my heart
Guys don't necessarily count on this kicker. I'm not so certain this game is over
I feel so sorry for Georgia :(
The bad guys win in real life. Sigh
Saban''s trick play this game was having a game plan for Tua coming in the 2nd half. 
[removed]
Young Tua. If he gets this, we''ll be singing songs about this kid. 
what the fuck is a crimson tide
They gonna burn the brand new stadium to the ground
Will the fR E sss HHHmaaa NNnnn QB make a mistake?
UCF could have beaten either of these teams.
Honestly why are they risking long snaps.  Dumb. 
[deleted]
That's what doesn't make sense of the stiff arm too me
fuck that i'm not dealing with another bama win. scar him for life.
TRUUUUEE FRESHMAN! TRUUUUEE FRESHMAN! TRUUUUEE FRESHMAN! TRUUUUEE FRESHMAN! TRUUUUEE FRESHMAN! TRUUUUEE FRESHMAN! TRUUUUEE FRESHMAN! TRUUUUEE FRESHMAN! TRUUUUEE FRESHMAN!
Guess the Chiefs will be drafting some Georgia players this year.
THAT EYE GOUGE IS OUR MOVE
troof rashman
Fuck the ncaa. Fuck the refs. Ruining football year after year. 
is it weird that offensive players can lead with their heads but defenders can't?
Post pics
All hail UCF
Pappa will choke. I guarantee it.
Again
Only offensive players with the ball *and Alabama defenders* can jam their hands into the opposing players facemask. 
For SURE
LOL Tagovailoa doesnt even know if he is allowed to celebrate after that first down.  Just a little hand gesture lol. 
Pick plays last year non call holds this year
Alabama's just that good
This was Mark Richt's fault somehow. 
RIP that UGA fan that went to every game this year
If this was NCAA 14 I''m 10000000% running FG block so I can get the ball back. Kirby, take my advice.
First the Falcons and now this? Man, I feel bad for the state of Georgia. 
Lmao this is just too fucking much. I hate Alabama but this sub is about to explode and I can't wait for the tears. 
Doesn't matter if they score a touchdown 
Fucking shit why couldn''t they call that then??
Refs helped a ton. 
Georgia became too conservative on offense and let Alabama hang around
When Georgia's coach is mad he looks like Ted CruzI'm sorry 
I was thinking the same. And it hurts to see Najee doing this well with how close he was to flipping to Michigan.
Please. 
Not the metric fuckton of missed holds? Hard to play defense when they cheat
Go get a flair.
I am very neutral in this game but Man did UGA get screwed by those refs. No title game should have 14 points due to bad ref calls.
I can't believe how hard Georgia choked this game away.
Give up the FG. Need that +3.5
Tagged
Ahhhh yes. We''ve played this game before.
Choke. Georgia playcalling was horrible in second half. To not have Michel in there was a huge mistake.
Why do teams just fucking choke against Alabama. They've been beatable all year and Clemson and Georgia have just shit themselves against them. Making idiotic mistakes for no reason.
I haven''t seen a team choke this bad since the Super Bowl 
Should we start writing espns article now? “Would UCF have prevailed?”
Hey guys, that face mask didn''t suddenly put 20 points on the board...
Is the state of Georgia doomed or something?
Too late
Refs and Alabama
Horrible ass play-calling for UGA in this last quarter.. 
State of Georgia on suicide watch 
gg y''all 
For such an amazing game, the way this ending is shaping up leaves something to be desired...
Why does anyone assume soft defense and conservative playcallng will work?;;
Alabama, you're tripping.With your kicker, fuck a field goal with the game on the line.
You guys beat Clemson, so you can't be that bad.
It all comes down to a former Ole Miss kicker... 
So much salt in here holy shit lmao
or a block, or a lucky fumble prior to the kick.
Who cares, Bama doesn't get flagged tonight.
Should've called better plays down the stretch 
Shut up already.
Ha! Holding penalty on Bama
Yeah bottles are real bad at running 
Alabama is New England
Lol they aren''t call a holding penalty on Bama 
It's got to be Tua, right? Granted he performs well at training camp.
They definitely Georgia''d this 
First the Falcons now this
God this is absolutely gutting. Georgia bleeding this away.
NCAA 2005 Update: I'll post the summary in the post game thread
I do.
Alabama and referees
who are you
I think the zebra MVPs are the real champs.  UCF national champions.
gg
Georgia gonna Georgia.http://66.media.tumblr.com/daeb65edf6daaf58321f9c1064fa653e/tumblr_o7qasgCwKz1rc7zl1o1_500.gif
FFS plz just blow it somehow 
Man, why didn''t that safety step up?!
Something tells me Tua has been ready for a long time but Saban was holding him back for next season since Hurts was doing well enough to get them to the Natty. Saban ended up playing next year's ace at the last possible second. 
Not to mention the Thrashers who literally haven''t won a game in YEARS
Refs and who else?
Y'all remember that missed facemask though? 
#notmychampion
It never fails. When it matters on third down or whatever else they will always get the call. You can fucking bet on it. And when they blatantly hold to get yards the refs will never throw a flag. Bet on it. UCF are the national champions anyway 
Just let Bama in the endzone and go for the tie lol.
i know this feeling
Watch out for Alabama''s kicker. He will choke. It''s in his head.
It's not over yet.
This is why we need an 8 team playoff honestly. So many good teams and we lose out on great matchups between them because of the conference set up. 
Were you there
It really hasn't.
So where's Jalen Hurts transferring to?
Calling it now. Georgia blocks the FG and returns it back.
You can change coaches but you can't take the *Georgia* out of Georgia.
lets give em 15 more yards refs come on
Can Saban retire now? He has done his dark duty. The entire state of Georgia (minues GT) has been destroyed. The world is in darkness.
Atleast we have the Falcons winning a Superbowl to fall back on... 
So don''t blame them for the blocked punt unreasonably taken back? The 4 missed penalties? Them holding and then scoring? Sure.
Not surprised at all. I love it. 
Lol what
Fuck''s sake.I swear the Patriots and Tide are like intrinsically linked from birth.Shit is frustrating to watch. 
Imagine being a Falcons fan and a UGA fan. My goodness. If you know someone who matches this criteria, reach out and let them know you love them 
Imagine being an Atlanta Hawks fan, balling on tickets to the SB, losing to the Patriots, then less then a year later Georgia in the Natty in your backyard, balling out on tickets AGAIN, and then this shit. Like 100x worse than passing it from the 1 yard line.
Bama can basically run it down and kick. We have to let them score. Or pray for a miss
Georgia sports are cursed
yeah...
Imagine all the incest babies the USA is flooded with when Alabama wins a National Title. Someone needs to stop this just on pure moral obligation.
H8 BAMA
Papa Nasty is not the best 
me too
They're more than close enough to make it easily.
Refs and Bama!
Nah they''ve been pretty damn bad, but Georgia had their chance. Sucks.
None of these officials should ever work again
Poor Georgia Fans. Choke to the two biggest dynasties in both leagues.
Bama wins here guarantees the NCS for the next 3 years if it isn't already.
"bama is so dirty!"-fan of a team who just eye gouged a bama player
To be fair they were absolutely shafted by refs constantly throughout the game
more like fentanyl
Nah
They *are* trying
Ikr lezzgo!
Yea I was strangely feeling happy for your fans. Maybe it was that I gave up my emotional connection so early in the game, maybe it was that it was 4pm game and it wasn''t a night game with some beers. Either way, that''s your one pass. Back to hating you now. Well, tomorrow. Enjoy it while it lasts. And fuck Michigan. 
Alabama and the Patriots are going to win championships.  What a surprise.
Hey guys, remember when Georgia got a sideline warning because they thought they won the game?
Missed facemask determined the game
I hate my life. I hate sports. I hate all of you. Fuck Alabama. Fuck Georgia sports. Fuck me.
THE BACKUP THAT COULD 
Roll tide. 
Alabama and the refs 
Tua 
He jinxed it so hard
Georgia should declare the championship anyway.
These must be the refs from Mich-OSU games.
Bama making this FG is no guarantee
[removed]
Aw no. Papa nostros has a bald spot 
Wonder what the viewership numbers will be
That was some 3 Stooges type shit.
Damn Braves..
Damn, after all that they're going to win and cover. 
Georgia became too conservative on offense and let Alabama hang around
Kirk just spent all that time saying absolutely nothing
https://imgur.com/gallery/dfPRL
Hey remember when OSU should''ve got Alabama''s spot :*(
Lol
Note to future champions - make sure to miss your conference championship game so you''re well-rested heading into the playoff!
Man if this comes down to a Bama kicker...ugh. 
[deleted]
That''s what I''m thinking
this comment reminds me so much of warriors game threads
Imagining being a Georgia fan kills me lmao
You don't even have to be a fucking football fan to see how shitty the reffing has been.
Well I'm glad a scrappy team that no one believed in is gonna be winning the championship this year
Do you just let them score?
I would have thought the idea was to center the ball not go to either hash in college but what do I know
Lol 
> This game will be remembered for Saban playing a player after he assaulted a coachAssaulting a coach after he assaulted a Georgia player.
You can just see the  Georgia player's faces, they know what's coming. 
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHATHIS IS LIKE A COLLEGE FOOTBALL VERSION OF 28-3.same state. unbelievable. 
Georgia does not know deway
I hate sports
I'm so happy I'm not invested in UGA sports. Falcons fan here....couldn't deal with heartbreak a 2nd time one year later like this.
Hawaiians are the phillipinos of america, and phillipinos are  the mexican if asia. You're  welcome bammers
Man fuck this bullshit 
Honestly, what's so bad about the officials today? There were one or two missed calls but that's normal.
they were never safe. they blow it all the time
Yeah, the *real* national champions
The darkest timeline. 
Them refs were quite impressive.
[deleted]
UCF is my national champion
So where do I order my UCF national champs shirt? /s
UmScott Frost wya?? 
We can't have anything nice. What did we do to the sports gods?
Are we gonna do the thing?
Literally that's how OU lost. Blocked fgs happen all the time 
Same reason the Patriots are so hated.  They win too much.  And there were 3 other teams with similar resumes who got passed over by the playoff committee.
That is true. Praise be to Baeshaun, slayer of Saban. 
#NotMyNationalChamp
Kirby Smart looks too much like Ted Cruz to ever support him winning anything.
Refs and helping bama
48 probably will after the game.  Then get a game ball.
Pass what you're smoking.
This is what happens when you go full Andy Reid in the 2nd half. Sorry, Georgia. 
I cant believe this is happening. Falcons last year and now this. kill me.
That bad call on the blocked punt turned the game
Winner plays UCF, correct?
I hate to say this but Bama is damn near unbeatable with a good Qb, That's what they never really had before
This is a 28-3 situation 
Put the entire state of Georgia on suicide watch. 
The state already did that by blowing a 28-3 lead on the Pats in the Super Bowl. 
Who? The refs? They enforce the rules, they can do whatever they want
Yeah this was pretty biased reffing. I''m all for “let the kids play” but it was pretty bad.
No it hasn't. They've significantly changed the game with obviously bad calls. 
UCF are the real champs after this garbage game.
Georgia: the ultimate state for blowing leads
The salt if Bama wins will destroy all life on this planet.
Just let them score a TD Georgia, give yourself time. Otherwise you're asking for a FG as time expires. 
Saban and Natties?
Lol a penalty on Bama 
When the refs can throw entire games like this, the sport is fucking broken.
Do people really think seeing fucking Alabama win another one is good for business?  I don't get why ESPN, CFB, and everyone wants Alabama to keep winning championships - it just makes fans who want new champions and top teams depressed and hopeless
That would be dope.
Sadly, Saban and NCs. 
He was sucking
it doesn't matter what plays you call if the refs are going to let Bama get away with facemasks and holding five or six times. They could have the best playbook in the world ;( 
Can't believe this is how the game ends. Utter collapse.
Saban good or UGA choked?
Still fuck our cousinsROW TAHD! 
Should have been y'all
So utterly depressing 
Not really Atlanta, that's Georgia Tech
UCF is the national champion
Every Georgia fan has that same sad face
Kirk can fuck off
Georgia deserves to lose this game.
Dankest timeline?
Alabama. Such an amazing underdog story. Just a rag tag group of freshman that somehow made it to the big stage.  Gag
Refs have kept this tight.... let's see if they can seal the victory.
Ruhl dam tahd
Tua days
Stop  using their services.
I didnt watch much of this game but that pass interference call was huge. Game changing penalty if ive ever seen one
I think that was bound to happen regardless of the outcome. 
You need to blame the playcallng
I'm.... alright with this 
That's because the CFP and the NFL use entirely different playoff systems.
BUT NOW HOW ARE THEY GAWNA ICE THE KICKER PAWL  THAT'S WHY KIRBEE WILL ALWAYS BE SECOND TO SABAN
This truly is the darkest timeline for Georgia fans. That timeline starting last year.
Must be nice to not even win your conference and have a shot at the national title 
I'd let them score and try to put together a drive. He's not missing from 25 yards
First the Atlanta Hawks, now the Georgia Bulldogs.
I enjoyed it. Don't like that Saban put #48 back in after his fucking shit
1995 Braves man. They were great.
Agreed, or it at least would''ve been close like this 
They literally beat OU doing that lolNot that I''d bet on that 
Alabama and referees. Kappa. 
Nah, that one was clear as day. Just like the one that went uncalled last half against bama. That's what everyone is up in arms about.
at least it wasn't a 28-3 lead
Not quite 28-3, but it feels familiar... 
Can only hope Bama fuck up the FG
damn, no lead is ever safe in georgia
should have saved the timeout to ice the kicker
Because he sucked
Playing to make Pappanastos the hero? That's a bold strategy, Cotton.
Sweating and sacrificing 
One can only hope
ill gild you if it does.
An Alabama fan and his cousin?
I'm mad for Georgia fans. Unfair officiating in the 2nd half
Georgia knows how to block kicks
Gurley on the sidelines?
Fuck the CFP Committee.
I hear ASU has a new coach that might be interested
I guess there's always spring games and next season to look forward to
Well she was attractive. Still is, but I can't see her anymore.
This has been the worst officiating I've ever seen in a sporting event, and I watch a lot of college basketball. Whatever it takes to win, right?
Georgia's defense had no answer to this Tua guy 
Come on Bama, get end zone. I need my spread!
The refs helped but UGAs offense not showing up in the 4th quarter is why this is about to happen. 
Me.
Overtime
Just got hard 
kirby is going to have to commit seppuku at midfield after this, holy shit. saban is literally just humiliating him.
Turned this off, not gonna stay up another 20 minutes to watch Bama win it on a last second FG
He has once this game. 
I feel sick watching this unfold, wow.
theyll get six book it
HOT TAKE: since Georgia has no timeouts, Nick Saban is gonna ice his own kicker
THE MEMES
Tua, it was basically sealed unless jalen went god mode... obviously he did not
How is ESPN's streaming service this poor? Stuck in the stone ages.
KICK SIX KICK SIX KICK SIX
Alabama can finish the comeback here all it wants. Saban will still summarily execute the entire team for going down 13-0.
Bama could just run the clock down and kick the FG
I''m scared :(. Seriously scared. 
We''re getting hit with downvotes almost as bad as that EA employee did 
He looked shaky on one of his kicks tonight but not likely 
Is this the new 28-3? Which was worse?
Both
It's soft in the fourth quarter on a drive to win the game when you didn't call one earlier
Hugs are wholesome
Awww kicker need hug
America wins.
I feel like only Saban could sub in a backup freshman QB for his first meaningful snaps and win the championship. (If they pull it off) 
Surprised tagovailoa can take hits like that as a true freshman and keep going. Tough kid. Respect
Even from the Philippines I feel physically ill for you Georgia fans 
Alabama “New England Patriots” Crimson Tide
lol unsubscribing.... its been fun yall. but as a georgia football fan.. i cant do this anymore. 
It's my show its Andy pappanastos 
Wonder where Hurts will go if he leaves? There's a very real chance that he's being played out of his job right here.
Better call Logan Paul.
Refs bad
Yeah, this validates all the bullshit that is CFB.We could always hope for a shank or something...
Refs not calling obvious holds, face masks, on Bama soiled this victory. 
where's AJ McCarron's girlfriend
Congrats Bama.  Again.  Why this kid wasn''t your starter all year idk.Also Georgia sports fans...I''m fucking sorry.
I hope papa nasty is ready for this potential kick
Is this gonna come down to Papanasty?
Fuck Bama, Fuck their fans, Fuck Saban. This will be the third NC they have stolen.
What's the saying.....next year is Georgia's year.....fuck Bama 
At least it's unquestionable that Bama gets all the calls now. 
Georgia lost this game on the three and out drive that they called 2 separate wild cat plays like fucking idiots 
Atlanta blows big leaderr sorry big lead blown IN atlanta by other georgia team, whatevs
So are we blaming this on Mark Richt, or...?
Idk how anybody could argue that. They might not be on the same level defensively but their offense is better than both 
Played like shit and got benched.
With Bama winning it proves that 1) You don't need to win your conference to be CFP National Champs 2) You don't need to win your division to be CFP National Champs3) UCF are the real National Champions
Bama Natty hanging on the foot of a kicker. What could go wrong? 
SURRENDER PYTHON SPOTTED ON BAMAS SIDE. STILL HOPE.
Todd Gurley sighting 
ALL THE LAND.
They got that one right. It's just everything that they've ignored. Blatant fouls on Bama that weren't called. Pretty bullshit imo 
choke job
He sucked in the first half, Saban benched him
Update: Bama swapped out medicine with bull shark testosterone. Currently attempting to light a bulldawg on fire
They can''t keep getting away with it
These Bama fans all anxious about winning the championship lmao... you guys have 4 in the last 9 years!!! 
creeping death 
Please i want bonus football.
And dirty hit on Fromm's helmet. 
[deleted]
I thought they did a great job 1st half. 2nd it looks like they 100% want Bama to win 
The amount of dicks I would suck to see that happen 
UCF undefeated Champs!
I've never felt bad for an sec team before but damn Georgia fans I'll pour one out for you guys.
And they blew it. Did y'all know Saban owns the souls of all his former coordinators? 
Georgia sports curse is brutal.
kicker acting like it is in the bag
Don't even talk to the kicker at this point man. You're just going to fuck with his head. 
Georgia turtled.Never turtle. 
I bet that kicker is like "FMLLLL"
NCAA needs to investigate some car dealerships and bag men.
Or thick Hawaiians 
Shutout the first half. He was playing real bad. 
Let them score the touchdown and give the ball back to your offense. #mydumbideas
REFS WON THIS ONE FOR BAMA
Somehow, there will be a flag against Georgia so he gets to try again.Maybe another SLI.
I only watched the fourth quarter and it seems that Georgia thoroughly deserves to lose this game. Awful, awful offense/play calling.
Watching Bama fans stress over their 800th national title is kind of gross
i hate bama so much
What was the lead ?
IT'S NOT OVER 
Bama should embrace the evil empire thing. Straight up crimson colored yankee logos, Real Tuscaloosa, lotr style championship rings, Saban should dress like the emperor for a post game interview. 
NO PRESSURE PAPPA
Dude getting his butthole licked tonight. 
Who forgot to feed the dawgs hate before the 4th quarter?
2 Georgia teams about to blow 4th quarter leads in less than a year
Fromm missing open throws and Georgia playing too safe
Did the refs sub at halftime?
Alabama kicker about to shit himself
hugs for pappanasty
More like 5-10 mins plus 2 commercial breaks 
Help us, Pappasnatos. You''re our only hope.
[Logic: 1-800-273-8255](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb24RrHIbFk)
Why is anyone talking to the kicker? Lol.
Harris you need to leave the kicker alone bruh
Is the 3rd best team in the playoff really about to win?
You had it Georgia! Dammit! 
Refs getting paid by the whistle blow.
Its okay guys, papanasty will miss the field goal anyways.(Please let me be wrong)
Georgia: "They were who we thought the were...."
Officials made some poor calls but running the Wild Cat with Chubb was just one example of poor play calling and execution by Georgia late
I'd rather be on death row than be PapaNasty right now
Such a terrible system
CFB coaching =/= NFL coaching 
He knos da wey
There's no way a Coach didn't tell him his player swung on an assistant. Fuck Saban 
You can hear the collective "REEEEEEEE" intensify from this thread as Alabama creeps closer to the endzone...
I can pinpoint only two egregious missed calls that helped Bama tonight, being the missed facemask and missed unsportsmanlike conduct on shoving Fromm's head. That's hardly handing them the game. Keep being salty, I love it.
To think Alabama almost didn't make the 4th seed.
So if he makes it, we claim part of the title?
A surrender cobra?  That was a Bama shirt, right?  
Alabama fans are gonna do the same thing they did with the play last year and complain that a team won because the refs missed that chokehold on the TD play, right?
It sucks that UGA was on the ass end of several bad calls. That blocked kick just sucks because at minimum it should have been false start 
Glad I'm not the only one that noticed this earlier. At least two Georgia drives killed by stupid reviews/commercials. 
Anytime a 5 or 6 seed wins the Super Bowl, we have a champ who didn't win their division. 
I for one welcome our new UCF overlords
Well game should be over but the Bama kicker couldn't punch in the first time. 
papa pls
Bad officiating will make this an asterisk game, unfortunately. These teams deserved an even playing field. Bummer.
Well theres seeding in the nfl and not a committee that decides who gets to be in the playoffs in the first place. 
Nah, not everyone.
UCF National Champions 2018
God hates good people.
Kicker shouldn''t be nervous. Bama scoring a TD here
when will teams learn the best way to beat bama is to keep the foot on the gas? play to win, don't play to not lose
Refs shifted momentum in 3rd quarter
IF BLAIR WALSH WAS THERE, HE WOULD MISS IT
The kicker needed a hug, aww
Have no fear, rest of /r/cfb, Bama kicking is here.
lol you think saban can fix the browns
Don''t forget the blocked punt. That''s 3 for Georgia at least
b/c he sucks
Nope
Refs did everything they could to make sure Bama wins.
Big Ten refs are terrible.
I haven't really seen anything wrong with it.
Who's scripting this? Vince Mcmahon? No one wanted to see Bama win other than Bama fans.
What is it with Georgia teams and blowing leads?
DAE not like Alabama?
UGA fans on suicide watch?
All the credit in the world to both these teams.  I was hoping Georgia would take it but it looks like Alabama is gonna get it.  Well played game.
Getting Super Bowl flashbacks.
I want a block and run back. Plz
~~Georgia football just blew two big leads against the greatest dynasties in their respective leagues. Ouch.~~
Tennessee and dumpster fires
Saban sacrificed more chickens at Sigma Nu.
I'm a TN fan and I'm not even this salty about Bama. They clearly deserve to be in and showed it.
Hawaiian QBs and comebacks. story of 2018?
I know that imitation is the highest form of flattery, but this Georgia team imitating the Falcons a little too much for my liking.
Pappanastos will come out for the GW FG attempt wearing a blindfold
Go to the Spanish one bro
This is not gonna take 20 mins.
Eh, my wife is a Gator fan so I absorbed some Georgia hate.
You could write a book on the missed, uncalled, and soft calls that went Alabama's way.
It''s time....KICK SIX PT 2: ELECTRIC BOOGALOO 
I would let them score tbh
What sucks is that the refs screwing this game, no one will remember the disgrace in 2 weeks. A player being allowed to play after punching someone and attacking a coach, weak PI flags, 2 players grabbing masks but only one being called - all will be forgotten. What an embarrassment to the game this display was.
it's over without college football gods' intervention.
Life is pain
Kickers gonna choke
Neither. This was 100% refball. 
There were two back to back earlier in the game that were pretty obvious misses... other than that I agree with you, but by now it's part of the narrative :)
I don't want to jinx us but how are we not getting ads? This is great
Saban has no class. Will do anything to win. Keeps 48 in there after swinging a punch at Georgia player and his own coach 
That didn't work out well for Ohio State 
its a 35+
Hahahaha If only...
Bortles, fixed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXOBW8SMAJ8
Harris talking up papanasty is the positivity we all need in this thread 
I hope the Bama kicker doesn't blow this.  Just score a TD pls.
>Refs blowing the lead...
PAPPANASTY GONNA WIN IT
Not to mention all the other missed calls on them too. The obvious facemask/horse collar that would ha e kept a drive alive. Can't stand when refs decide the game
pretty much the refs, but Bama beat them a little too
All I asked for was a good game. Thank you, Football Gods.
Fuck 
Is the kicker a true senior?
Is it too late to get Ohio State in?
Every other app I have is great....
 I for one am not confident out this field goal at all. 
Alabama cannot be stopped, can they :'(
Alabama coming back to win this, if they do, is classic Tide.
Bleach
Agreed!
This sub is virulently anti Alabama. 
roll tide? 
Thank fuck I wasn''t born into Georgia sports All I have to deal with is the Browns 
Refs let Alabama back into this game, but we just choked it away in the 4th quarter. Terrible play calls, couldn''t get a 1st down, couldn''t get a stop. Makes me sick.
You most certainly are.
I'd quit sports altogether if my college and NFL teams massively choked 4th quarter leads in championship games.
Congrats UCF!
It would have been taken away even if they called false start on Bama...
I feel so bad for ATL sports fans lol. Thats two heart breakers
We beat this damn team
I'm a little high and refusing to believe this
I NEED OVERTIME. 
A controversial Alabama win in the national championship game is a fitting end to this season.
Which curse is stronger? The Georgia curse or the Alabama kicker curse?
Pls. Not another blown championship to an evil empire.
Try to get another first, if third or fourth run it down to 2 seconds. Do a field goal. 
I''ve always thought it was weird that the ball carrier can go at a face mask but no one else can
Your logic is sound. But this is the committee we're talking about...
Because Bama has been committing penalties, including facemasks all game and not getting called for it.
Because Bama got away with like three.
Go back to your cheese mine wisconsin, you're drunk
This shit is staged
And not going against them when they obviously should?
Congrats, Christmas came late for you guys
lol me too that's what I thought when I saw him though
Saved by da refs.
Georgia teams have mastered the choke
just a vulgar display of power on bama's part.  they have the depth of 2 D1 teams
Rip turntle
This whole game, really
You can't compare NFL to CFB, they are two different beasts
The guy fell and they called opi when the ball fell out of bounds.
remember the wrong offsides on the blocked punt and the missed facemask that gave Alabama chances to get back into his game? yea same here
Can we get a 10 second rundown ala NFL
I'm not sure why they didn't call timeouts before Bama got into field goal range. might've given defense time to prep 
Already have. Damn. 
Holy shit you're right
Whether or not he should is irelevant. Players have done far worse and not even gotten suspended
Guys it's not over. Bama still has to kick a field goal nothing is certain.
Bill Belichick has found Brady's replacement tonight
Watch ESPN is the most finicky app
Because the refs didn't call a bunch of 50% stuff on Bama. 
COCKS
Our national champion UCF has successfully gone undefeated! 
Come on now you guys didn't think bama would just waltz into the playoffs, third in their conference, to be made fools of in the NCG? Nah, the refs are here to help out. 
PAPANASTY is the kickers official new name.
I can relate
I''m switching to hockey. This shit fluffs my Garfield something fierce. 
The call was right for sure. People are just mad cause many blatant calls that would''ve gone against bama weren''t called.
His IG is lit. BRB going to drink some bleach.
BAMA CANT KEEP GETTING AWAY WITH IT. 
How poetic would this be if Georgia blocked the kick and ran it back 109 yards
Anybody got a goat they don't care if I sacrifice 
Tua is like Manny Pacquiao. They look small, and then you look at their calves. Tua has barrels for calves. 
holy what a game. 
the strength comes from his last name
Being a Bama fan (non-alum) is a sign of bad character.
Refs did everything in their power to gift this win to Bama.
Now we find out if he truly is the Nasty Papa.
Chiefs chief and Bulldogs bulldog.
Just let'em score so you have a chance...
Imagine losing to Kansas
Want some cheese with that wine?
Because bama has been face masking all night and several blatant personal fouls and getting no calls. 
90% of UGAs play call in the second half was run-draw option. Conservative playcalling led to this downfall
I don't even like either of these teams, but holy God was this the most biased ref squad I've ever seen. 
Gonna be a sad week in GA especially after the Falcons get beaten as the favorites in Philly.
I, for one, would like to vomit.
[I done told ya, Georgia.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/7p48fo/game_thread_cfp_ncg_georgia_vs_alabama_8pm_et/dseed5g/?context=3)But I certainly feel your pain, Dawgs.
Bama kicking is no gimme.  Still a chance for OT
Congrats Alabama on your victory.
its bad
I think he transfers, tonight pretty much enures Tua gets the nod from here on.
was that stop girl?
Detroit lions / Utah Jazz / BYU fan here. So do I. 
Tua has definitely made a strong case for himself. Love his arm. Love his vision. Just needs some coaching in the off-season. 
There are 2 year olds all across Alabama just praying they get to see an Alabama national championship in their lifetimes.
I want to throw up for Georgia folks right now.  I can't imagine what this is like after last year's super bowl.  Sorry fellas, hope he misses the fg
On the flipside, there's some weirdo kickers that need to be talked to at all times or they start fucking with their own heads
How are you neutral with Bama playing lol
Alabama might as well prepare for a throw to the end zone. They aren't kicking a damn field goal.
They just havent played a B1G team:)
FG unit on now? Kick it at the right time, game over.
I'm so proud of this team. They beat Bama on the field. The deciding factor without a doubt was the refs.We didn't lose to Bama, we lost to terrible officiating.
Please god, not again
You can hear when Tua tightens his helmet
Kickers probably don''t actually want to talk to anyone before a huge kick
so much salt.   jesus christ y'all are whiny as fuck.
Probably doesn't know about the coach yet. Settle down.
Love it 
My only duty from this point forward is spamming that UCF are the national champions and that its ridiculous how hard the refs blow Alabama. 
Papa nasty, send us to overtime baby.
This game sucks with the refs handing the game to Bama
You have a ridiculous name.
Yah
Every program has their players try to assault the coaching staff?
KICK SIX PART 2 PLZ
We needed to let them score
The worst part about Bama potentially winning is now we get to see the committee pat themselves on the back until the end of time
Uh, yeah I'll take your [opinion into consideration.](https://data.whicdn.com/images/144969592/large.jpg)
Jesus.
Why not let bama score so fromm gets the ball back? I'd take those odds over a missed 25 yard fg..
They always show worried attractive female 'Bama fans any time they're in trouble.
[deleted]
Why do so many Alabama fans wear a pink shirt with a black vest? Is it like a thing? I don't get it
Im so nervous for that kicker even though i hate alabama.
Georgia teams only exist to choke.
feelsgoodman. better shade of red. better team.
Laces out, Dan. 
UFC national champions
So this is the officiating crew Ohio State uses for all their games.... 
So is blowing leads in the 4th quarter in championship games  just a thing all football teams from Georgia do?
Do not fumble.
You guys haven't watched much Alabama football. Missing this kick is the most Alabama thing we could ever do.
I just want you all to know I hate your fucking guts
Slooooow death
[deleted]
Does this count as an Atlanta sports collapse?
Kirby Smart huh? The last two minutes of the 4th have been an absolute meltdown 
Credit to Alabama if they get this done. 
I wanna downvote but damnit you're right. 
Not until we destroy that evil man.
UCF UCF UCF UCF UCF 
Might as well throw a game in the division, miss the CCG and get the extra week of rest if you''re a playoff contender.
Saban leaving it up to the kicker is a bold strategy 
Salt!
GG guys. I think this game is done for.
Georgia fans look like they just saw the credit card bill after Christmas lol 
ALABAMA KICKERS ARE SUSPECT THIS IS NOT AUTOMATIC
Just like I said, will not go into OT
Torn apart by dogs, they don't finish you off so you bleed out 
and both in the sport of football
Man every year I just want anyone but Alabama to win and every year they do. I have Patriots fatigue with them heavy
This game wouldn't piss me off if Alabama made it seem like they might lose.  The fact that they teased us with that only to fucking win regardless is absolute dogshit.
Then you haven't been watching. Blatant holds.
Bama doesn't deserve this win
Not a fan of game ending FGs
#NotMyNationalChamps 
My heart. Please.
Exactly. Calls are going in favor of Bama right now because Georgia is committing boneheaded errors. There isn't a grand conspiracy going on here.
Please please please please uga win
It's so grating how Kirk feels like he has to explain things like the audience is made up of people who have never seen a football game before.
Georgia is out of timeouts, there's no way they're getting a drive together
nah, kicker unreliable
I dunno I still like UCF
Damnit, thats game. 
kicker looks like he's gonna vomit
A college kicker. Who knows what will happen? 
why is cute bama girl surrender cobraing 
Fuck him. Fuck Saban 
The football gods already took Wentz away from me, don't give ~~Satan~~ Saban another Natty
Please miss
Fuckin Georgia
and the missed facemask call 
Imagine being the kicker.
And I'm going to remind you that these are the best that was chosen by a small group of people. Fuck, imagine how this would be if it was FCS or Div 2.
Take a timeout at 6 seconds. Kick it on 3rd. Play it safe.
Welp...
Saban has tried his hand in the NFL and it didn't work too well. 
This motherfucker 
Shrug I don't think Bama is getting help that was my point earlier. But the incorrect call changed the game and was a difference of 50 us field position. Irregardless refs make mistakes and Bama earned the win with the gutsy play to have a freshman come in and play amazing. Cheers :)
When I die I want the Bulldogs to lower me into my grave so they can let me down one more time
Blocked and ran back for a td calling it
i called the fat guy pick earlierso georgia could use a fumble right now
Even if they miss the kick, do you back UGA to score again? I dont
Cause Alabama scored zero points the whole first half
Nobody enjoys your disgusting program winning games either. 
I don't trust papa to make this
I second the motion
Evil wins in this timeline
The mood is dark in Athens
Yeah it''s fun when both teams are good and there''s a more even matchup. And totally. I was watching Edwards thinking the same thing. A little bulk this offseason and he''s a carbon copy, you could tell he was young physically this season.And Deebo is just special with the ball in his hands. Carolina has had a few guys like him over the last few seasons- Cooper and Byrd- but none as complete as Deebo, though Cooper was special and it''s a shame they couldn''t get a team around him.You may have figured me out with the cheer for one go to the other, but for the sake of anonymity i cannot confirm.
Never count on a Georgia team to beat an Evil Empire. Braves, Falcons, Bulldogs... doesn't matter.
In ten years I can't wait to see bama vacate most of these championships for whatever elicit shit is going on there

Please block it, please!!
Refs aside, this game by Tua is legendary
All hail the Knights!
Classless player, classless coach. 
You mean the last 4 hours?
lol yup. They took the momentum away from em and gave it right to Bama. Impossible to win no matter how good of a team you are if the game isn't officiated correctly.
These Refs fucked Georgia 
Inb4 the FG kicker misses.
NotLikeThis
inb4 kick six
Yeah let's shift the WR to play QB and maybe we'll fool em!
He's trying to win a championship
A second missed fg would be hilarious.
This field goal is gonna be blocked
[deleted]
Little of column A, little of column B
Not sure but on the drive before that the same player had a DPI called on him that was absolute bullshit, the WR just fell down and they threw the flag
I hope you''re right lol
Lane Kiffin sendin Jalen Hurts that “you up?” text after this game. 
Wife: "How close do we have to be to be sure we make the field goal?"Me: *laughs*
game
I was just saying that Bama could really use a stud true freshman qb...
What's with all the whistles? 
meh it's not like a different SEC team winning makes it cool unless it's Vanderbilt they're cool.
God I am so sorry... 
Blame the B1G officiating.
They crammed them all in earlier. 
Again, worst defense in the world. I hope they all start punching the fucking couching staff then.
lol someone else's comment just reminded me that alabama didn't even win their division.  i don't give a shit about that at all but i had forgotten
Georgia is going to lose to a crappy kicker. This is rough.
dudes gonna miss his kick 
Man, I can''t believe Georgia are giving this one back. refs have been pro-Bama, but Tuavailoa looks pretty decent. 
i cant take this, so tense
Yup
we'll always have the 95 braves and those olympics... right?
Footballs about winning, go watch a different sport if that bothers you
HOW SHOULD WE KILL OURSELVES?
They are jinxing the fuck out of this poor kicker.
God damn it dude 
True dat
UCF > Auburn > Bama
If ur gonna give Bama the game dont make me say up until 12 on a Monday to see it 
Something something Georgia sports teams cursed
I never want a kicker to miss but dear lord please miss.
The kicker is about to shit himself 
Bama gonna win this to remind us 2018 is no different than 2017 and we are all gonna die and life doesn''t matter.
Can't believe they're leaving it to their kicker. Especially with the way Georgia blocks
No TOs so no Icing the kicker...
Lol that's what I thought
Don't feel bad about waking up at 5 in the morning. When you're in the workforce, that won't seem like such a big deal.
Riperino georgiarino
MAJOR nut alert 
Alabama is gonna win this game, aren't they?
Can''t blow a lead if you never get one. Wait I think my ravens were down like 21-0 last year to the browns and we came back. Never mind. 
And we''ll allllll be back next season 
Kick 6 2.0?
Man, Georgia kind of pissed this game away....with a little help
And now we look to Papa Nasty to keep us out of OT.I'm going to vomit.
Jesus H Christ, Scott is tall 
More like Kirby DUMB hahahahahhaahahah
Obvious runs are obvious. Better put only five in the box. 
Wonder how the refs' bank accounts feel after tonight...
how the fuck does someone that's not played all year come in and tear shit up? so stupid
At least they don't deliver false expectations.
If Bama doesn't challenge UCF to a backyard ball contest, this ain't real
r/patriots celebrating Alabama's win.
after the game, Georgia Coaches vs Refs in cage match .. 
Lmao I just copy and paste it so I don''t have to type it out every time 
Crosses fingers for blocked kick and return. Plz, spaghetti monster
Wtf. Seriously. 
Well guys, this was certainly a football season
Georgia would be on suicide watch if they weren't accustomed to letdowns.
Georgia fans out there u aight?
Pls block this
Bama defender got a finger on a Georgia mask earlier. I don't know the rules on that, and someone in the thread said that its clean under a new rule. 
Alabama is going to have so many Tua''s born in nine months that Huntsville will be renamed little Honolulu.
Good news is, if you bet Georgia and the under, YOU WIN!
Kick-Six 2: Championship Boogaloo?
Bamas kicker has a trud sticking halfway out his ass 
Couple missed ones earlier but it doesn't matter since that one was so close to the first on a first anyway. 
[removed]
Saban looks happy...
Alright y'all, you know what time it is! Can I get aFUCK 
UCF is gonna go from meme to annoyance to the undisputed champs in this subreddit
BLOCK IT BLOCK IT BLOCK IT BLOCK IT
The missed unnecessary roughness. The blocked punt  that was called back. The PI was that called on 3rd down in favor of Bama.
lol
Gotta bad feeling about this kick
UGA is still champs in my heart. You go Dawgs
[Quick! Before the game is over!](https://i.imgur.com/LZxFs7d.jpg)
Thank the true freshman.  
In the opposite direction? Steph doesn't get nearly as many calls as other stars. 
Barely shanked the good one thru earlier.
I guess us Florida fans are the only ones here who want bama to win lol.
Who else is cheering for a kick 6?
This..is..it
A lot of incest happening tonight, boys. Bama goes hard.
wow, the bulldawgs are gonna have ptsd for the rest of the century over this
Only thing that feels better than Georgia losing is that they choked away the lead to do so. 
Knees weak 
They could''ve done a better job with the holding g in my opinion but yeah all in all not bad 
Has there ever been a city more talented that can't seal the deal when it comes to sports? Lol
Damn it's over
Cheating. Fucking. Refs. 
The Fans Ode
Dude better not miss the fucking kick 
COLLEGE KICKING
**UCF IS MY NATIONAL CHAMPION**
doesn't matter who wins. We all know UCF is the national champions. 
WHY THE HELL DID YOU LEAVE 6 SECONDS NOW THEY CAN LADDER?!?!Clock Management level Holmgren.
Block six pls
I started this season being happy with 8 wins. I would''ve been fine just making it to the CFP. And I would''ve been fine playing a good game now... but not like this with so much bs from refs and dirty play. We earned a win today and it''s been taken. 
Alabama's kicker giving of that FSU wide right vibe.
Georgia cant ice him at least he knows that. 
Dont care much who wins this game but if Georgia wins then ESPN will stop talking about it in a week. If Alabama wins then they''ll be talking about it all the way until the NFL draft
If Alabama wins by a field goal that is the definition of poetic Justice
Andy is a handsome fella
I'm gona stop pretending now and let you live in your little world. 
one miracle please
Tua wanted overtime 
no shit almost none of the best coaches have class. thats why osborne is the greatest of all time
I mean, he's definitely not the only coach to ever keep a player that fights coaches.
hey look saban throwing a fit there's a surprise
I'm hoping 48 kicks the field goal. Wins it then punches Saban in the face!
Goddammit Georgia don't meme like this.
It's all fun and memes until Bama wins
I would have done that regardless of the result tbh
We almost forgot to fucking snap lmao, now Saban is forced to settle for a hopeful FG
Hopefully someone hits the OT button at BWW
Saban is about to unleash his fury
Well UGA, now you know our pain almost every god damn Saturday.
Yeah they're fucking garbage, I bash them in most game threads
fucking refs man.
uCf ShOuLd HaVe BeEn iN InStEaD oF BaMa
I''ve been a big Saban fan, but that made me lost a ton of respect for him. 
When you sell your soul to be a football god, there's no need to concern yourself with mortal problems 
He's literally all the way out on the field?
Wtf was that. 
Quite the angle on the kick now
Dies he miss?
Congrats Bama
Auburn 
Fingers crossed 
I''ve been watching since the beginning of the 4th quarter and the officiating has been great. People also bitched about the obvious deep PI called against UGA too when the defender shoved the receiver to the ground. Looks a lot more like fan bias than ref bias to me. 
That dude at Buffalo Wild Wings needs to turn on the sprinklers during the kick. I want to see over time
BAMA
BECAUSE STRESS
CONGRATZ UCF ON YOUR UNDEFEATED CHAMPIONSHIP SEASON. ALL HAIL OUR STEEL PLATED OVERLORDS. 
Someone near the officiating squad must have bet on this game
PapaNasty
I'm ok with all of this
People are bitching because the refs have missed a lot of calls against Bama, including facemask calls. 
Well they took away the blocked punt, that''s one. They missed a blatant face mask that led to a punt. They should have ejected the guy who threw the punch. There have been a billion holds not called. 
Of course Saban has to embarrass this kid 
Pappanastos can be one of two things: Hercules or that annoying Greek kid you grew up with who tries to convince you that Greece invented civilization.
I'm fairly certain the state of Georgia is cursed for sports now. What god did they piss off? 
#FIELD GOAL
BAMA
the refs
The perfect salt combination 
I've heard of teams losing because of their use of the prevent defense.  But the prevent offense?
FUCK
oh my FUCKING GOD THE PLAY CLOCKNOOOO
Saban, I think the refs have taken plenty good care of you tonight. Stop bitching. 
Tua was about to end the game lol. 
Life
Dude stfu
I went to Super Bowl 51 and the National Championship.I hate sports I hate sports I hate sports I hate sports I hate sports
Sounds like a win win to me
oh he better
FUCK
Yup, all 50+ of those guys on the field are in on it.  You're clearly quite the enlightened one. 
"You got this man.  No problem."*If you miss this kick then I will fucking kill your family and have sex with your girlfriend*
Good game
GA robbed of points on the blocked punt is souring this for me
FUCK
Bama will make it
~~Palpatine~~ Saban: The rumors of my demise were greatly exaggerated 
Everyone get the #notmynationalchampion ready
I AM WILLING ANOTHER KICK 6 INTO EXISTENCE VIA A BLOCK
What a fucking joke. I appreciate the fact everyone else sees what bullshit this was. How fucked the refs were. Enjoy your paper trophy bama. Btw you should sit players after they attack a coach...
It's been a pleasure shitposting with you, gentlemen.
I thought they were going to fuck that up lolol
**UGA BLEW A 13 POINT LEAD IN THE COLLEGE FOOTBALL PLAYOFF NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP GAME WHERE KENDRICK LAMAR PLAYED THE HALFTIME SHOW**
That Papa...is Nasty
I hate Bama but I like this Tua kid.
It''s so funny how ppl get so invested in Bama losing
I've lost all respect sorry this is absolutely rigged for money... Or ratings in not sure which. I won't be silent . Just saw it live sry./s
Well, I guess if this thing comes up short, he can field it and run it out. Alright, here we go: 56-yarder, it''s got—No, does not have the leg, and Chris Davis takes it in the back of the end zone. He''ll run it out to the 10, 15, 20, 25-30, 35-40, 45-50, 45—There goes Davis! [oh my gosh] Davis is gonna run it all the way back! Auburn''s gonna win the football game! Auburn''s gonna win the football game! He ran the missed field goal back! He ran it back a hundred and nine yards! They''re not gonna keep ''e
GG Alabama. GG.
Saban what do you expect from your freshman QB who is literally in his first full game? 
Still trying to figure out if there are any true freshman playing in the game /s
PAPPY NASTY DO IT
Even if he misses or it gets blocked I'm sure they'll just throw flags until he makes it
BAMA
The ducks
They''re gonna do it aren''t they....
Tua needs a damn haircut for that ugly ass blonde spot
Georgia needs a miracle 
#MISS MISS MISS
It would have been awesome if he snapped the ball and the clock ran out?
They should play in a cornfield 
Everyone but Bama fans knows this is bullshit.
K I C K S I XICKSIX
GG Refs
Exactly like we want it.Just kill me now.
Georgia blew it like Oklahoma did, starting calling way too conservatively on offense. Went two drives without a pass. 
Get ready for a kick six
Yes
well also overly conservative playcalling...
It''s been an honor tonight, boys.That being said, fuck refball and fuck the Tide.
miss this fucker
PLEASE DONT MISS IT
This is a big fucking kick.
Holy crap Bama almost ran a play.
That infuriates so much. Most likely cost Georgia  3 points, maybe 7
Classic freshman mistake.
Jesus I can only imagine how many college birds star football and basketball players would pull after winning a championship. That''s what dreams are made of. 
I still want UGA to win:/
Pretty pretty please
Your team got overconfident too early. 
Congrats to the 2018 National Champions:  #UCF
Herschel Walker is upstairs casting voodoo magic. This thing is clanking off the upright and we''re going to OT
Great job getting him out
Noooonnnneeee noooonnnneeee 
HERE WE GO
McKenzie Milton vs Tua Tagovailoa pls
BAMA
DUKE?
It happened to us against them and holy shit did they get smug. Couldn't happen to a nicer group of fans.
I'm just here for the memes.
https://pics.me.me/000-you-almost-had-it-nfl-memes-gotta-be-quicker-13868893.png
This bama freshman QB is legit but there''s no way he''s making it through an entire sec season if he keeps trying to run people over 
Pls miss again
LATE METEORS
Nah, I don't ever give a fuck
I thought the Georgia dome died for this ??
As a Browns fan I certainly wouldn''t mind it with our shit fucks. Just saying CFB success doesn''t always mean NFL success. But I get what you are saying. 
Reminder that UCF is still the one true champ
He's gonna miss isn't he?
I know what my heart wants, but my brain is saying otherwise.
This whole game hinges on a very weak PI call. GJ Alabama.
Here it is ladies and gents...
Pappa, pls 
Saban has done more to correct bad behavior then you'll ever come close to in your life
Saban about to get another title and he still pissed af
Why not kick a FG on third down with like 7 seconds left? If it''s a bad snap then just fall on it and call another TO. Saban wanted to spike it there 
ANDY DO NOT FUCK THIS UP
pls no OTpls no OT
Let's see some OT.
#WE WANT OT
6 seconds remaining in a national championship? Imagine the poetry that would be a shanked FG here
Fuck this
Refs and Announcers.
AUBURN
You guys also blew it in the fourth quarter. You were outplayed. I think the officiating was bad but come on guys Bama played better in the end.
If the top comment in the post game thread isn't "Congratulations UCF on your 2018 national championship" you've all failed
The irony is real... 
do they play the FG misses on the big screen?
BAMA
Big ten refs are just mad we didn't get a team in the playoff and bama took our spot so they might as well win again 
Pats fan here. FUCK BAMA!
Well damn.At least in the NFL the Patriots don't win every year.
Saban freaks out when a freshman does freshman thing lol. 
First the falcons now the dawgs
I''m predicting a block
Man, at least I''m not as mad now as I was after the Super Bowl. I''m such a hater.
Miracle time
Say it with me: BLOCK THAT KICK 
papa nasty send us to hell
as a Bama fan, I just hope my other teams, the Patriots and Yankees do as well this year.
Should have just let them score a TD so you could at least get the ball back.
haha, how great would it have been if he snapped it and used all the time?
Refs didn't cause Georgia's offense to shit the bed in the 2nd half
WHY THEY SCURRED
The memes....
College football is bullshit. After shit like this, decades of Pac-10/12 refs, all the scandals, cover-ups and the RichRod thing I think I'm out.
So how does UCF become co-champs
Shit Georgia playcalling aside, any and all shit calls went Bama's way this half. 
FUCK YES
This is pretty much game over unless Papa Nasty misses a 20 yard field goal
#he gon miss
I'm so nervous for that kicker.
BEGONE THOT
Please run another play. Please
DO IT DAD
Nick Saban has to tell Bellamy to humble himself PLEASEEEEE
Everything
UCF CHAMPS 
Fingers crossed for missing the kick
It would be a kicker to have the natty rest on.
So this is rigged to make the selection committee look good, right?
Saban wanted it in the middle of the field. 
please papa, please papa
Miss it fucker
THE REVIVAL
I had the alt line for Georgia at -7.5 as well ... not happy about that
Yes it is.
Georgia is the new Cleveland 
If I was the kicker I would be shitting my fucking pants and throwing up in my helmet. 
The state of Georgia is officially on suicide watch. Holy fuck this curse.
Holy shit was he about to snap it lmaoooooo
Me before the game: Georgia winning this would make them the undisputed champion for the 2017 season. Me right now: Bama is about to win a share of the championship with UCF. 
#KICKSIX
Georgia lost this game
This is so so sad :(
Guys I hate Bama as much as the next guy but what calls have been egregiously bad that everyone is talking about?
Fuck this game. Bama on the Refs dicks.
“No OT tonight”             -Bama''s kicker
One kick to decide who gets to be Co-Champions with UCF.
I find it interesting Bama's huge ass backs aren't carrying the ball.
Either #CollegeKickers or #GeorgiaSports will strike. Let's find out. 
Choke 
Please block this
Saban instantly benched the kid lol 
Same.
>The deciding factor without a doubt was the refs.Gross and laughable
kick isn''t going in. zero shot 
That butt smack in Saban was so.... weird.
If Bama started Tua we'd all be asleep right now. Eat shit Saban.
Great win*
Most UGA fans are also Falcon fans
nah you lost.  Against a freshman QB who didn't play until the second half.  Ya got got.
god the saban dick sucking by ESPN is going to be so annoying
I would love to be an offensive lineman for Bama. Zero penalties ever.
UCF real champs
UCF is the true National Champions
kIcK sIx
Auburn fans - what are you rooting for here? Feel like a Bama win is preferable but that's just me. 
if there is a god, yes.
Nah, don't do that. Reffing was a deciding factor but moral victories are for losers.
They missed an equally blatant one on Bama earlier that led to a UGA punt. 
They didn''t call one against bama a little earlier in the game 
One team is allowed to facemask. One team isn't. Thats a huge difference.
So the refs missed 2 personal fouls against Alabama which cost Georgia automatic first downs. Shove to the head at the end of play and face mask 
They keep on giving him words of encouragement it's going to end up psyching him out lol
get those memes ready boys
Georgia teams should not wear red in championship games
The ole Penn State v Ohio State kick 6. 
Alabama has sacrificed many field goals in preparation for making this one. gg wp.
hes gonna miss
This is it...this is where it ends 
Saban wanted him to center the ball there?
Bama winning= NaRefs helping them= ClThe perfect combination is brewing boys 
In a cornfield 
nah
"We got to 20-7 on zone runs, lets run some wildcat shit in the second half!"
no
The kicker is going to make it 
GIVE YOUR ENERGIES TO KICK SIX 2.0
Its the worst nightmare for both teams. Last second field goal by Alabama 
All I ask for is a miraculous gust of wind or a shanked ball.
Why doesn't anyone ever just let the opposing team get the touchdown? They're in field goal range, they can run the clock down. Why not let them get the touchdown and have some actual time to go for a touchdown and send it to OT? Only other strategy is to rely on a missed field goal.Edit: well Fuck me. I guess the strategy was to rely on a missed field goal.
He's gonna miss.
We've been here before and it did not go well #triggered
Classless program that got saved by the refs. 
UCF! UCF! 
RELEASE THE OT
At least the last quarter has  not been a commercial fest
Ooh boy Saban is mad about SOMEthing
gentlemen, no matter what happens, it has been a privilege shitposting with you tonight
Alabama is going to remember this for the next 22 years before they die prematurely due to brain injuries we knew were happening, but chose to ignore because football is too cool. Gonna be the best 16 years of their life until they lose all memory of it. Roll Tide! 
Jesus fuck hahaha
I don't think I can say kick six any longer!
Did you really earn it in the second half though?
BDubs button plz 
This kicker is really gonna fuck this up isn't he...
What is it with the state of Georgia and choking?
Instead of being a punt block its "offside" 
MISS IT FOR THE MEMES!!!!
Sigh. Not my champion. 
I will never find a husband for the sole reason being that I am UNBEARABLE to watch a football game with. I'm fucking pacing y'all.
He''s scoring with like 1-2 second left? 
This wouldn't be so bad of a comeback if it weren't the atrocious inconsistent calls by the Refs
Some fat ass Tuscaloosa car dealer bought hookers for all the refs before the game
God damn, I'd rather be performing brain surgery than kicking this field goal.
The Alabama kicker is either gonna be drowning in women or getting death threats in the next 24 hours. SUCH EXTREMES lol
Tua almost Colt McCoyed that one.
Kick 6 v2.0 please
Also why not kneel since running it could lead to a fumble
plz block.
At least they don't know how to manage the clock
Please miss
Georgia blocks the OU kick and won''t block the Bama kick. Thanks Dawgs
For entertainment's sake, I for one am hoping for a blocked kick.
Come on football gods, give me OT
If he misses and it goes to OT this thread will flip faster than a Waffle House pancake 
It'll all comes down to this
Kicker will either be a hero or get death threats from Alabama rednecks.
Bama didn't win last year.
Rose Bowl 2nd half: Kirby SmartNCG 2nd half: Kirby Dumb 
I can see Finebaum's erection from Texas. 
Turn out the lights folks, this party's over. 
“Jalen Hurts (born August 7, 1998) is an American football quarterback for the Alabama Crimson Tide who was benched in the 2018 National Championship Game for a real winner like Tua Tagovailoa.” - Wikipedia 
Watching them show these replays of missed or blocked kicks just convinces me it's gonna go through
Where is glasses kicker??
hurts?????
BLOCKLOCK
Miss
Lol this is dumb 
IS this literally going to come down to Alabama''s kicking unit 
SIX SECONDS AWAY FROM THE OFFSEASON DOWN THAT FUCKING BEER AND LETS GET TO SHITPOSTING
Somethin bout Georgia teams blowin leads
Whew, GA teams have a way of blowing big leads!
Imagine the nerves this kicker has rn
What the hell?!?
LACES IN LACES IN
I''d pray to god to stop this FG, but Saban''s existence proves God has forgotten about us 
The absolute dog shit ref calls is what pisses me off I hope their children hate them. 
My unbiased opinion is the refs gave this game to Bama.Actually at this point I might hate Bama so much that I can't say I'm unbiased 
On behalf of everyone outside of Alabama, this was a disappointment
Jalen Hurts back in the game?
It''s raining where I live 
**FUUUUUUUUUUUUUCCCCCKKKKKKKKK.**
Calling it now: Doink!
That terrible call by the refs on the blocked punt is the deciding factor in this game. The books should have an asterisk if bama wins
Say it, Fowler! Say he's nearly perfect!
Aaron Murray is about to bawl on national television
All Georgia sports teams are good for a collapse
this is nothing compared to NBA and NFL playoff threads
Alabama is going to win its 5th championship in the last decade but NOPE MUH PARITYeat my ass
What Chris said about kicking and golf is so true. Was told that a million times throughout my life. Kicking is like a golf swing.
I just feel dread right now. I can't imagine how actual Georgia fans feel. 
I'm ordering a UCF national champions t-shirt 
If there is a God this will be blocked and returned for 6.
Refs fuck team close to beating Bama, more at 11
If he misses, they crucify him, right?
Remember the '96 World Series?
Some 5th dimensional chess there, we just don't get it
As a Pats fan I can honestly say Georgia has suffered enough.
This might be how the zombie apocalypse happens. The riots will hit the CDC
I love it when you call me big Pappanastos
Pls don't miss
Please god let there be a block
It's spookyoclock bois 
College kickers
I do
WCGW
He''s gonna miss. It''s Georgia''s destiny after the Falcons. They deserve it.
Game not over
Dude.
that kicker is tweaking so hard lol 
Jalen Hurts might need to go Tua new school next year.
Wtf???
Hurts fumble
Enjoy your paper loss? 
10 sec run-off
OT pls
UCF!
Saban mad that he's going to win the game lol.
It is a good thing that Alabama has a history of clutch last-second field goals in big games
Tua's haircut is awful 
Bama will make this FG.
Kyle Chandler is the Bama kicker? 
I hope it's either made or blocked. Not a miss.
Block that kick!
I'll eat my shoe if a kicker wins us a national championship
I'll never understand how they still refuse to recruit a half decent kicker 
I hope he misses this FG
I have an eerie feeling that Pappanastos might miss this FG. Those steps he takes in prep just doesn''t look on-point at all.Edit: Wow...
PAPPANASTOS looks like he's 30. 
In many ways it''s better to never get close. 
"Coach, I don't take Clocks 101 until Spring quarter!"
Over this game. UCF is my champion!
Maybe we'll see a kick six? 
Fuck you Alabama
Oh this is going to be a bitter offseason.   GG Bama.  
Miss to the right I'm guessing
Bad snap 
This game is a good argument for people who like polls and not settling it on the field
Fucking up the FG is NEVER out of the question for Alabama
Saban sacrificing the freshman QB''s body for another trophy 
I have a buddy who is a Laker/Cowboy/Yankee/Bama fan.He might be the biggest front running doucher I know lol. 
Can we vote for UCF to be the true national champion if bama wins 
#NotMyChampion
The dude tripped. It was handfighting that happens every play. And Watch the Bama line. Have they gotten some calls right? Yes, but they've missed countless holds that sprung guys (most in the 3rd quarter)
block it.I believe in you 
This is the ultimate kickers' nightmare
I hate my life so much
I figured Georgia would win. My mistake was not realizing Saban would put his nuts on the table and bench his bum QB for a freshman who had the juice. 
Oh god the salt that's about to happen...GLORIOUS SALT.EDIT: I stand corrected.
I mean, I give it 70/30
Auburn stopped them lol 
Do you cook?
"Ooh, Papa Nasty tiiiiiiiime"
HURTS MVP
Fun to come all this way and have it end with exactly the result we all thought it would.
Maybe we'll end this on a blocked kick six ;) 
It's embarrassing that this is upvoted
So Bama has it riding on a FG. Georgia is looking like they blew a double digit lead. Lots of clenched sphincters in Bama and Georgia right now.
Time management anyone???
Jalen did the thing! 
*Sharpens dick chopping knife*
He went too far left!
Bama's gonna kick as time expires but miss it and Georgia runs it back for a touchdown, right?
Good thing Georgia played not to lose in the 4th quarter! That really worked out well.
Lol he almost ran a play that would have ran the time off
What all Alabama fans wanted, for the game to come down to an Alabama field goal...
Lol backup qb''s can''t read a clock
Any wisdom in a case like this where you let them score once they get in the FG range and get the ball back?
Please miss
my god if he misses
After all that they move it left?!?!?!?!
Choke
We aint so bad now huh 
The Ghost of There Goes Davis approves
PLEASE GOD BLOCK IT
Please miss
This will be an interesting way to end it.
I feel bad wanting him to miss, but not as much because I bet some people on here want him to break his leg in the process.
**BLOCK THAT KICK!**
NONONONONONONO
Same 
You need to feed him cheese curds 
I swear they just moved back the kick
Ded
:/
Isn''t that the same guy who should now have 2 unsportsmanlike conducts?
Bama is trash. I tried to give them credit, but they're all trashy. Players, coaches, and the majority of the fans I've met.
How the heck did Tua not manage that play?
This sport sucks 
god damnit, now we have to live through more UCF contested title bullshit 
*little ewa beach
No you didn't, Fromm was inaccurate in big situations. You blew it, pure and simple.
Excellent my dude
Suck it up, the officiating wasn''t bad. Your RBs couldn''t do squat.
We went to the fucking wild dog too many times 
i would have died if they fumbled or just ran it out on accident lol
Love to see Hurts fumble the snap
Is he gonna shit himself as he kicks
blocked punt called offsides...
More like get removed from the team 
Those Olympics were right after I was born in ATL and my parents volunteered. Is that park still around?
DownHereSaltIsAWayOfLife.mp4
Charizard, use GUST! PLEASE! 
On how this game has gone, of course he isn''t missing it...Alabama, king of the benefit 
UCF is my champion
Had he fumbled it, I would have chuckled 
When will Georgia fans realize that they cheer for a mediocre football program? They are the only real football school in one of the Top 5 states for high school football. Atlanta, which is right down the road, is the biggest city in the south. They have perhaps the best brand recognition in college football. But they haven't won shit since 1980 (almost 40 years!), which makes them no better than a middle of the road program. The most delusional fanbase in the nation refuses to admit this.
Saban clearly has no morals and put winning over everything and everybody. I wish somebody would shame him over this but ESPN will never mention it again.
Would've loved it if he let the play run too long and time ran out
Bama won't miss this shit
fuck bama
Choke
Please Papa Bless.......
LSU has to play Bama + refs every fucking year
If pappa misses this, ill call him daddy!
You put in Hurts... now?
I wish they would kick and UGA could return it for a TD....would be the most fitting end
Jesus this is a thriller
HERE WE GOOOOOOOOOO
I want a miss so Georgia doesn't lose... But I think I want to go to bed more so fuck it. Roll tide.
Lol who do you think they are? Auburn??
FOR ALL THE TOSTITOS?
He''s looking like he is gonna miss this 
Kicker must be shitting his pants
Block
Any chance this guy misses? How accurate is he?
UCF! UCF!
No you won't 
If Bama's kicker misses... I'll do something
Who's got the Buffalo Wild Wings button?
Where's Chris Davis? Shouldn't he be in the endzone?
Not give yourself time to squib kick. Smart.
It''s gonna get blocked Edit: EVEN BETTER
If this goes to OT on a fucking missed field goal Ill blow my brains out
You've watched an Alabama gave before
Because kickers are head cases and liable to miss. Especially Alabama kickers. 
Bama absolutely deserves a shanked FG.
HURTS IS CLUTCH 
I would quit watching sports if I was a Falcons and Georgia fan
Fuck the refs
BLOCK IT
[deleted]
Oh snap!
Lol you cant say shit. Im not even a dogs fan but I know football and your team didnt get 1 offense of holding flag out of a good 15 holds. Lol tua had day because the ref let you haha
UCF is my champion
Because Bama.
oh fuck me this is stessful, and i dont even watch CFB.
Pity plays for Hurts lmao
FIRST THE FALCONS AND THEN GEORGIA.... sheesh 
I don't really care about either team, but I literally can't sit right now.
I need a h8 filled dog to block this
Time management far better than Andy Reid''s
Choke
Saban is the best coach in CFB history.
Andy Big Papi Big NastyGo be a legend
Or a miraculous gush of water through the super dome to down the kick 
Refs arbitrarily decided to take two away so the outcome can be what they want it to be.
*veteran kneeling skills*
Just fucking wow
Kick 6 Part II?
The refs did not lose you this game. Tualogia did 
This is where die
Oh god oh god oh god
Block returned for a TD.
Oklahoma woulda blown Bama out of the water tonight.
please miss the kick
SABAN HAD A SOLID PLAN, LET''S SEE IF IT PULLS THROUGH
That could have gone poorly, that was dumb
I can't tell if this is the darkest timeline or the dankest timeline. Either way, let's get fucking weird with it guys. 
He won't miss. Fuck.
As a Falcons fan, I'm so fucking sorry for y'all, Georgia fans.
Is this shit really happening? Down to our kicker..... oh sweet fuck.
H8H8H8H8H8H8H8H8
Why not try to get to him faster? Might have run out the clock.
Awwww man this is fucking intense!
HAHAHA. BENCHED
Kirk would die 
Sorry Georgia. You gave it a valiant shot.
OT OT OT OT...although, on a block though, I'd feel too bad for the kicker otherwise.
YAY JALEN HURTS PROUD OF YOU FOR SHOWING GRIT AND COMING BACK
I feel embarrased to be a fan of the B1G
The state of Georgia is going to petition Congress to shorten all football games to 3 quarters. 
Holy fuck could you imagine if Hurts fumbled the snap? 
I want OT.
inb4 Bama misses the field goal and the refs call offsides on Georgia again LOL
BIG POPPA
Damn risky 
And then transferred lol. 
Sup Penn bro?
BLOCK DA KICK
FUCKFUCKFUCKFUCKFUCKFUCKFUCKFUCKFUCK
woof 
"He's a good golfer" not what you want to hear about your kicker.
FG SAFE ZONE OR FG SAFE MAN? DECISIONS DECISIONS
I would shit my pants if I was Papanasty
Refs keeping the game close did it for Bama in the end.
Hurts gets the last snap
BLOCK THAT KICK! BLOCK THAT KICK! BLOCK THAT KICK! 
Pappanastos:>No OT tonight
I''d die 
Tune in next year for the conclusion of the CFB national championship. 
I would have kicked on 3rd so if the snap is bad you can lay on it
UCF is my champion
I swear to god if Bama puts this kick through, they will win the game.
WHY DOES IT HAVE TO COME DOWN TO A BAMA KICKER
Alabama gonna miss a fg and it'll go overtime
“Center it”Just off center.
I couldnt imagine so much pressure 
I''m dead on the inside 
NO PRESSURE DUDE
Bama wins it on a field goal. Calling it now 
Hurts for the Boys 
Is that Tony Romo going to kick
yes it's right between the stadium they're playing in and GT's campus
Khaki guy can't even 
How ironic that it comes down to our kicker
Did ya'll get robbed by the refs also?
OMG.  Historical moment..
Fuck Bama and everything they stand for
Conspiracy by the committee to deflect from UCF
So Hurts gets to start and finish the game. EDIT: OR NOT
I can''t handle a Bama win and I can''t handle overtime
Papa looks shook
Pls save us UCF 
There are a few games I would say have been completely decided by horrible calls by refs. Most games I would say you should have made the plays to win the game. Unfortunately Georgia did make the plays to win this gameThis is one of the games decided by refs.
The state of Georgia needs to implement a program for the mental illness that is being a Georgia based sports fan.
God fucking damn it
Blocked kick returned for a TD come on
Come on Papageorgio miss it!
Let's go papa!!!!!
Yeah like the iron bowl a couple years back?
I hate this game so much. 
This is outrageous it's not fair!! How could one be called the best but not win the title of champion?
No pressure here lmao
Bama should not win this game. That fucked up blocked field goal and missed face mask decided the game. 
Earn the name Papanasty. You beautiful long legged mother fucker, you kick this down the middle
Can we get a quick commercial before the kick?
Papa Miss
Mad respect for Hurts tonight, really handled the benching well
Block and run back for td
Because of the blatant facemask the refs missed that would've extended a ga drive in the 3rd
Blocked fg, return for TD, then get called for offsides.
I believe.... Papa Bless
He makes this
I really want this to be in OT. 
Roll Tide! 
It's the color
Buffalo Wild Wings, press the button!
MISS IT
All of them
Anyone at Buffalo Wild Wings wanna help out?
Beamerball is coming boys...
RIP
Hurts leads Bama to game winning play!
Block
I know in hockey, Hurts would be the goalie of record... does it work that way in football?
please... that would NEVER happen
And the Hawks suck. 
with that flair? you'll find someone who wears out the floor before you
SOMEONE GO GRAB CHRIS DAVIS
Chaos needs one more say in this game.
Nick Saban is a disgrace to football. 
Refs sucked. Georgia playcalling sucked. this sucks.
Block pls
Dude no..
OT plz Bama can't win it all on a fg.
He''s a man, he''s 40
Block that kick!
I hate sports. 
OT please
id love to see that
I like you
So you''re saying the coaches on Alabama are purposely not telling coach saban about it???
WIDE LEFT!! DIOS MIO!!
The thoughts and prayers happening on the Bama sideline...
Fucking refs man. I don''t usually blame the refs, but this game is on them. 
Bama doesn't mess up opportunities like this. He will make it.
Fuck bama
Would have been awesome if Hurts had just gone all "FUCK YOU SABAN BENCHING ME YOU FUCK YOU LOSE" and run to the other end zone for the safety
The whole College season comes down to this one play. Great stuff
No, as a neutral third party, Bama outschemed the fuck out of y'all. The refs were mostly fine.
I''m rdy 
Your flair makes me want to punch kittens
CONGRATULATIONS TO CENTRAL FLORIDA!! MY NATIONAL CHAMPION!!!
He's missing this, isn't he?I'm down for overtime.
I could not be a kicker
FUCK YOU ALABAMA. SERIOUSLY. BE MEDIOCRE FOR ONCE!!!
Everything about this is just pure Bama. I hate them so much
Saban: "Look, don't fuck this up"
Pls Georgia
What is happening 
So are we down for calling UCF champs. Lol
lmao half italian. indeed I do
        F        RT R U E        S        H        M        A        N
PLEASE GOD!
That guy praying right in front of the kicker probably isn't helping the mental state of Papalapadingdong.
How funny would it have been if they mistimed that last play and time ran out?
Oh my god. This is it
Bama is gonna miss it and Georgia  is gonna get called for offsides. Watch
First he had to take ladders 
Still too bad for this game 
#H8 BAMA
I have no more fingernails 
That second half play calling by cheney was way too conservative 
Fuck these announcers
Remember, kickers are people too. 
And also Auburn! It completes the circle
Do kickers wear white and black now?
Alabama to kick a field goal in a tie game to win    What could go wrong 
Traitor
Drink?
He may not be comfortable getting the snap under center 
This is why we need an 8 or 10 team playoff. So there is no debate about UCF or anything.   Oh well I can't complain right now because if Bama pulls it off, I win my Bowl Mania and $250
Rip georgia
Y'all have seen it! Hurt's last snap as a QB at Alabama
Bamas gonna miss it. They''ll call sideline infraction on UGA celebrating and redo it
Everyone schedule Mercer now
bobbled snap comingup
[deleted]
inb4 trouble with the snap...
UCF won the popular vote. 
Fuck. No. I feel bad for UGA getting screwed out of this.
Nope but UGA also hurt themselves. That was a really bad pick by Fromm. 
Bama vs UCF next week 
It's not fun when Alabama wins
UCF is my champion
Such a boring fucking game. Another FG
that's terrible. The guy desperately praying on his knees next to the kicker. No pressure dude.
Kick 6?
Kickers are people too
Tua is waaaay too mellow at the line. Never looks like he's in a rush
https://imgur.com/ppC9NkF
Imagine being in the kicker's shoes right now
HERE WE GO
Cant spell choke without Georgia
I don't even care who wins and i'm nervous..
Bring it home, Pappa.
muffed snap calling it
So did the CFP succeed or fail this year? 
Oh lawd
Say it with me.  #NotMyChampion
UGA has been robbed. I want to know how much the refs were paid. That punt block turnover was ours 
Atlanta/Georgia sports in a nutshell
No way he misses this
Silly Georgia band. You aren't supposed to play imperial march, that's Bama's song. It only makes them stronger.
Lmao he was scared the freshman was gonna fuck it up and put jalen back in.
Cool story. No one cares
Because they have more points.
Ha, dude on his knee praying right in front of the kid that's about to boot the biggest kick of his life.
saban eliminated his bad snap insurance. please god let that cost him.
You can't allow 20 unanswered points in the national championship game and expect to win.
His practice kick better have felt good 
Miss it 
That decision is so strange.
SCOTT FROST IS THE REAL CHAMPION
BLOCKKKK
Alabama Laces Out
Freshman 
DON'T WALSH IT
Hit that over time button!
Atlanta fans about to go through apocalyptic hell all over again.
This is it. Win or OT?
He gonna miss
Block that kick. Block that kick.
Sooooooo sick of this
Hero or villian?Edit: he Dead
My family has now decided “Papa Nasty” would be a great rapper name.
ISS!
Accurate username ~fellow Ohio shit team supporter (Browns) 
It's the only way.
So who's gonna start the #NotMyChampion?
BLOCK THAT KICK
he makes it and he gets his pic of the litter  he misses and is shunned
Miss that kick
Missed. 
UCF is my champion
Win the game now, or in OT.  Georgia will not win this game.
There were others, but those two were the most egregious. 
Plan:  put in all the freshman!
Lmao I respect that level of hate. 
Young, young, Georgia, southern, young, freshman, choke in a sweaty, hard hitting game with ball sharing
Benched. Unbenched. Rebenched. 
Fucking freshmen
Pls no OT.
Why did they put Jalen in lol 
#NotMyNationalChampion
Anybody got the Suicide Hotline copypasta?
I'm just here for the puppy tears 
Offsides
No way he's missing this one
I can''t imagine vexing this kicker right now
#REEEEEEEEEEEEE
offsetting penalties, holding.
lol they won the sec championship this year wtf
Why did they put Hurts back in?
Anyone having falcon flashbacks?
Holy shit
Oh man oh man
Go Pappanastos. The spirit of Blair Walsh is with you!EDIT: MUAHAHAHA!
Kick to win it all. That's you're dream as a kicker. 
Please miss this...
hashtagNotMyChampions
HOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOK
Congratulations to the 2018 CFB Champions, UCF
Called it [3 hours ago](http://reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/7p3r99/game_thread_cfp_ncg_georgia_vs_alabama_8pm_et/dse9i4r). He fucking missed again. 
Well uga blocked a punt at the Bama 20 and it was called offsides. The player clearly wasn''t offsides 
Sorry but your delusional if you think they lost this without the refs favoring alabama . Not 1 holding flag on the 2nd half 
This is embarrassing. 
Why do I even watch football? It brings nothing but misery and despair. Edit: nevermind, he missed the kick. 
ESPN (and apparently the refs), can I ask why you think Alabama winning half the National Championships in the last decade is "good for business"?
Papa Nasty is a sick nickname 
Pappanasty better not fuck this up 
Once his knee or elbow are down, he's down.. so no.
I'm shocked I tell you
He missed.... AGAIN!!!
UCF the real champs anyways
That will be the top post in the post game thread. Maybe second after people complaining about the officiating. 
LMFAO
miised it!!!!!
HE FUCKING MISSED IT
YEAH!!!!!!
OH MY GOD
>30 for 30: Papa Nasty>What if I told you that you can, in fact, be too Greek?
Looks like [a receiver false started](https://twitter.com/JimmyTraina/status/950589387770916870) on that TD
LOL
That halftime show was a joke, it wasn't even on the field.
I usually just kick my desk, makes me feel better.

Holy shit that was an awful kick
At 1 minute left, it struck me that Georgia should just let them score 7. It was basically a chip shot. It's more likely they might get a td return or drive than the kicker misses.
Oh FFS

Bama needs to shell out 10 million dollars for the best kicking coach in the world this offseason.  I have no idea how they consistently have such miserable kickers.
One is understandable but two is just unacceptable.

God hates Georgia fans, wants to give us all heart attacks

Nailed it
cheers mate. I think it might have been a difference of ten yards, that's about it.
I HAVE TO FUCKING WORK TOMORROW! WILL ONE OF YOU TWO FINISH THIS SHIT!
Should've brought a freshman in to kick too, Saban!
The ghost of the Atlanta Falcons pushed that kid.
Poor kid...
Alabama and field goals..  it''s a tradition!
Things more reliable than the Alabama kicking game:Windows ME
He missed!
Welp. Kickers continue to fuck us. 
SABAN:  I'll give you my soul if you make me the highest paid college coach in history and win a bunch of national championships.SATAN:  You've got a deal but the world needs to know that we made one.SABAN:  OK but we can't be too obvious about it.SATAN:  How about you put some bullshit benchwarmer in in the middle of the game as quarterback and you win anyway...
Alabama would have like 3 more natties if we had a kicker, like, ever.
You had one job. I mean seriously, he doesn't kickoff anymore.
Alabama''s kickers have been other teams MVPs for a handful of years now. 
OPEN UP THAT OVERTIME THREAD, BOYS
Yeah I'm behind.  but lol he missed it
OMG just logged in to reddit and saw all these comments before my stream played the kick. WOW!
Bama, NEVER. TRUST. THE KICKER. EVER.
wow
HE FUCKING MISSED IT!!?!?!?!?!
HOLY SHIT!! HAHAHA
Feel bad for the guy, but you know, it''s Bama. Not like they''ve never had one before.
And homicide watch
Someone get #12's family into protective custody now. They are not safe in alabama.

Welp
Breakfast tacos? 
OT thread?
FUUUUCK YES!
The SEC has some jazzy sounding fight songs/fanfare.
That guy is going to want to change his name and move as far away from Alabama as possible.
We are all Pappa bois on this blessed day 
IT HAPPENED
Papa nasty papa bless
...this year has had the best games I fucking swear
Are we getting an OT thread?
You got to be kidding me.  I hope like hell they get a kicker this off season.
AM I DEAD?
Sleep is for the weak!
[TO THE OVERTIME THREAD WE GO!](https://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/7p4twp/game_thread_cfp_ncg_georgia_vs_alabama_8pm_et_ot/)WE ARE WORKING ON THE LINK BUT REDDIT IS WIGGING OUT AT THAT MISS, WILL LINK MOMENTARILY.
SHOUTOUT TO THE GUY WHO SAID ITT TO NOT TALK TO THE KICKER AT ALL BEFORE THE KICK, NOSTRADAMUS
Work is so soon
That kicker is gonna be locked in a room with the guy who was swinging on the coach. Two men enter. One man lives. 
Bama fans phoning in the death threats as we speak.
OT THREAD BOIS
LOL minor league football at its finest
OT thread!
I hope Georgia wins this so bad fucking Bama kicker misses two kicks lmao nice scholarship you got there 
Not even close. Aeya Aeya Aeya Aeya Aeya
Yikes
What really
Refs can''t kick field goals, assholes. 
Wow. Just wow
Ugh
W E W L A D S EWLADS
onmggggggg
somewhat surprised saban hasn't had an aneurysm yet
This is a close game. Not a good game
GOTTA GET IN MORE COMMERCIALS! 
RIP
That kicker is going to get death threats. Poor kid 
to the left to the lefthahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
ESPN: “Due to contracts with our sponsors, we will be bringing you highlights of overtime with only a slight delay during this paid programming.”
I just wanna go to sleep, god damn it kicker
Damn son.....DAAAAAMMMMMMMMNNNNNN
Saban got too conservative there. We'll see if it costs him.
WOW that...wasn't even fucking close lmao
BAMA AND GEORGIA BOTH CLEARLY DON'T WANT TO WIN THE NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP BECAUSE THEY KNOW IT ALREADY BELONGS TO UCF
If jim Mcelwain had never been hired that would've been eddy pieneiro kicking who was one of the best in the nation... Just a bit of a fun factMac is fucking nick in the only way he can
I need to go to bed FUCK. Hurry UP
Holy shit
GEORGIA LIVES!!!!!!
WOWWWWWWW
OVERTIME!!!!!
come on OVER!!!
SHANKED it
OT clinches it for UCF
[Let me ask you this...](https://streamable.com/2jkcj)
saban should have been having more sleepovers with kickers..
You have one job kicker 
It's a tie! That means UCF is undisputed champs!
Are you fucking kidding me lmao
I would feel bad for a guy like that from any school other than Alabama.And Michigan. 
SEE YALL IN THE OVERTIME THREAD 
A higher power vs. the refs...who wins...
That was Pappanasty
The Bama kicker curse returns!
God dammit.
"Fuck me"-Nick Saban
lolololol
The missed facemask on third down, unsporstmanlike conduct for shoving the QBs head into the ground on third down, and the phantom offsides on the punt all had a massive impact in stunting Georgia's momentum. Nonetheless we wouldn't have OT without them
Do they have a back up kicker to put in?
I just can't anymore.
Probably hours 
oh i totally agree but in terms of ppl rooting against the warriors saying they get all the calls lol
I'm rooting for Georgia...but man...that poor kid. That was a terrible wide left choke-a-rama.
Dear mods, where is the OT thread?
What the ACTUAL FUCK! Yes overtime 
Tonight we find out how many overtimes is too many overtimes. 
#**MEMES**
My app is freezing up with the flood of comments after that miss
“IM NOT WATCHING AN ALL SEC CHAMPIONSHIP CUZ ITS GONNA BE BORING AS SHIT”
The Alabama governor has hereby instilled a travel ban from anyone of Greek descent to,the state of Alabama from here on out.
A Georgia football team in OTwhat could go wrong?
LUL
I don't even know what to say.
Dude they are already on the way
3rd round pick would be a steal 
He was a former Ole Piss kicker. What do you expect.
No but pretty damn good
Damn I feel so bad for bama''s kicker 
WTF I LOVE GOD NOW
Maybe he should have put it on the right hash...
Hopefully UGA can figure out how to offense again in OT.
NUT
THE BAD GUYS CAN'T WIN THAT EASILY
I just pissed my pants
I've had my 100th heart attack tonight but thank god its not over yet.
I've come to the conclusion that when the game comes down to Alabama being able to make a FG, that Alabama will whiff 100% of the time.
If they stayed to the right would that have gone in?
LMAOOOO
Temporarily stashes Georgia sports curse memes...
NICK SABAN IS A BITCH
SABAN CAN'T PULL A FUCKING DANTONIO
HOLY SHIT HE CHOKEDguess the refs can't even call that field goal good
Feel sorry for the trees at their house. 
Lmao
HAHA I JINXED IT YOU FOOL
I actually feel bad for him, and I hate Alabama with a burning passion.
I thought kicking was banned by Bama after 2013 Iron Bowl?
Death Threats
holy shit. put that kid in therapy. 
That feel so bad for that Kicker he must feel horrible
\*sobs\* I just want to go to bed \*sobs\* I'm getting up at 6:00AM \*sobs\*
Bama fans already sending that kicker death threats on twitter smh
GOD IS REAL
WE''RE GOING TO OT 
TEAM CHAOS FOR LIFE!
HO LEE FUCK
I HAVE TO DEAL WITH THIS HERE TOO?!
No, the real champ is whoever wins this game. Alot of people seem very confused about that.
Kids career is over but at least we get OT now
Saban, "Fuck me." Gimme dat GIF. 
W T F - why'd they put it in the middle?
The football gods smile on us!!!
Lol wow he missed
Saban will dine on blood tonight.
OVERTIME BABY 
Poppalotamiss
That kicker may not make it back across the state line if GA wins.
Oooon to the overtime thread boys
I bet the refs are pissed
This has been a wild playoff series.
Is there going to be a separate thread for overtime?
Rose Bowl Part 2?
Alright UGA, don't fuck this up now...
Better than trash of NFL OT we got in the Super Bowl.
quit your job
imma be worthless at work mañana
OH MY GOD WE'RE GOING TO OVERTIME
I CALLED IT! HOLY SHIT! OVERTIME BABY
I thought he was gonna cry
#LOL
Andy Pappanastos was a perfect 13-for-13 on kicks from 35 yards or less in his career prior to that missed FG
RELEASE THE HOUNDS
We never fucking do
Good news - you get another shot! 
a true freshman would've made that
There is a God!
College kickers suck!
Get some Gatorade. That is some dry mouth pressure there.
Saban broke the #1 rule of college footballNever under any circumstances trust a college kicker 
You know it really do be like that sometimes
Holy fuck me
Roooollll incest.  Feel bad for the kicker though.
Wtf is happening 
I'm gonna be fucking dead tomorrow morning
LOL
The Dark Lord is not pleased
Karma is **A GODDAMN BITCH** Bama. Get some more shitty calls. 
Not even s/
Death threats to the kicker incoming? 
Holy. Fucking. Shit.
If Bama don't win this, their kicker better get a bloody transfer. If he goes to Georgia, he'll be a hero.
Gotta admit, I''m extremely glad that we didn''t have a TO to ice the kicker with.
Went from getting laid to getting put into witness protection
YEEEEEEET
It's only 9 PM in the PNW, I'll still have time for a shower and some Netflix before bed.
Well, fuck me.
East Coast people who have to work tomorrow AM in ruins
HOLY SHIT THERE IS A GOD
Whatbis it with Georgia and overtime?
I know I really dislike Bama but still was kind of hoping the dude would make the kick....I feel awful for him.
I'm trying.  For some reason you just won't die
DIVINE INTERVENTION STOPS THE REFS IN THEIR TRACKS
Kinda hate to say I called it...
I have to go to bed an hour ago.
Fuck. I just want to go to bed since I live on Eastern time.
I bet Alabama fans are kicking themselves right now
Put money on Bama at halftime to make the comeback. Brutal FG attempt
Oh thank God.  I think I just woke up my kids cheering, but I'll take it.
Shitshow championship game.  Why not?
God Damnit. My Sports Alert app updated me of OT BEFORE the snap on my stream. 
H8 FEEDS THE CHAOS
Someone call an ambulance. I legit just passed out after that play...
Fuck. Yes.
Better ingredients, better shanks
No turning back now. Also hey! Always nice to see an /r/hockey regular out of our little abode.
Legendary
People in here calling him pappa nasty and that's the name you go with?
HAHA YEAH FUCKERS YOU THOUGHT IT WAS OVER 
"It's Brucie's time to shine!" -the kicker
Knowing Bama fans, that kid is gonna get hassled for the rest of his life if they lose.
lmaoooooooooo
YES
LOLOLOLOLOLOL! YOU HAD ONE JOB!!! 
BRING ON THE OT GAME THREAD
The boys got no stones.
I DONT BELIVE IT
Lol saw that too. Too good
Fuck it, we''ll take him. - Miserable Hawks fan
NEW LIFE BABY
If they lose, how many death threats does the kicker get? I''m putting the over/under at 100
#WALSHING 
Jalen Hurts will have a transfer partner at least.
After watching them play for the last several years.... Alabama should really invest some scholarships in kickers.
Fucking kek he shanked it.
I'm sorry but even though I wanted that PK to hit that kick--it was so bad I laughed my ass off...
LETS BREAK OUT THE EXTRA SIX PACK
THE BUTTS HAVE BEEN CLENCHED 
"Just taaaaaap it in"
HAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
See you on the OT thread.
Did that just happen?
Holy shit ahaphalabaidipabageowpabshiduddhehee it''s wide left it''s wide left!
MacGinnis makes that kicks
Lol.
put Hurts back in and the kick was shanked. Coincidence? 
Oh fuck me sideways...I can't take anymore of this!
Saban and choke kicks, name a more iconic duo, I'll wait
It''s not over until it''s over. 
Exhibit A
Savage lmao
No shit. That's why a ten point minimum swing against the best team in the country is such fucking bullshit. 
He fuckin shanked it omg
#HOLY SHIT LMFAOOOO
Bama fans gonna crucify this poor guy if they lose.
Georgia beat Alabama I fucking hate Alabama winning so much I''m so jealous of it right now.
#Q5 thread
Here we go natty bois
Poppa “Finkle” 
Excellent 
Oh snap!
Maybe there is a god 
Wow. What the fuck 
The check hasn''t gone through yet
That boy's gonna have to transfer schools after tonight.
I NEEDED A REASON TO CRACK ANOTHER BEER!
I want both teams to lose.
Bama and Kickers...does Saban just not care who kicks for you guys?
THANK YOU BUFFALO WILD WINGS BARTENDER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
That kicker looked more nervous that a unsure preggers chick on Maury P 
Over time thank you
Not even these refs can ignore that
How many times has Saban thrown his hands up in the air out of frustration tonight? 
Ouch
Wow fuck shit
Oh my fucking god 
He definitely did
SABAN MUST GO!
Flair doesn't check out
Seahawks already looking to draft that kicker.
Who pushed the b dubs button.
Well shit 
Was that the area water was leaking in from roof? Kicker''s foot slipped on his plant and he jerked it
I was feeling that miss.
MADA MADA! MADA OETE IMASEN!
EAT A DICK BAMA 
I don''t 
Cuz you keep taking them.
Yeah but it will suck less that way
Odds awful Bama fans send that kid death threats>
We got an overtime thread?
Oh my Lordt we ain't dead yet
Georgia got their miracle. If you don't win this game now, barring some more referee fuckery in OT, you have no excuses (jk you do because referees in regulation) but you get my point
This is now officially as good as UGA OSU. I cannot describe how happy I am.
HOLY... As much as I don't want Bama to win.. my heart goes out to the kicker. 
#WONDERFUL!
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Duck!
OR A QUARTERBACK 
Walsh
this is what happens when you walk up to the kicker and psyche him out with your shitty pep talks. 
Ends in a tie, CONGRATULATION UCF NAT'L CHAMPS.
Damn you Buffalo Wild Wing's it's late!
Hi yes I'm dead
oh fuck my throat hurts from screaming and I woke everybody up but I dont fucking care
I wanted pappa nasty to miss but now I feel really bad.Poor guy doesn't deserve the hate he's gonna get.
Just wanted to say I was here for history
He's a ringer for Ole Miss
So now do we have an over time thread?
Bet not recruiting a kicker''s starting bite Bama in the ass again. Dumb shit. 
Ok, lets play some more football!
I still think Alabama wins this but man at least we get some overtime. lol 
Do we need a new thread?
"OT Tonight."
They all fucking suck... 
I think I speak for us all when I say:LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL
Buffalo Wild Wings wants some more football
That kid must owe the Atlanta mob money.
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA 
Damn he makes Blair Walsh look accurate. 
My fucking windows decided to update right before the kick god dammit
Oh god have mercy on his soul... someone call the marshalls and get his fam and friends into WITSEC ASAP 
that's what happens when you have a freshman qb in there throwing everything off. wasting time not knowing how to center the ball. then the sideline is filled with anger from saban and your kicker gets rattled.
What a lil bitch.
DAFUQ?!
THIS IS THE BEST TIMELINE!
This did not age well
For the second time in a month Alabama skews left.
Time for our 6th game thread
Saban forgot about kickers when he signed his deal with the devil
I feel bad for him. He was probably so worried going for that kick
HOW THE FUCK CANT BAMA GET A GD KICKER
Back and to the left 
"Fuck me" -Saban
Fucking pathetic kick. 
So blair walsh is playing college ball now?
Holy shit
Georgia and missed field goals, name a more iconic duo.
We have reached an 11/10 on the dank-o-meter. 
Lol.  Chokelabama
Then the outsiders screaming the same thing!I can confirm I yelled that.
To be a kicker that misses a kick that important in the state of Alabama... I would not want to be him. 
ROLL WIDE!!!
I love watching Saban do his little wtf hand gestures after someone screws up.
**BEST BUFFALO WILD WINGS BUTTON EVER**
He dreamed of going to Bama, now he's going to have nightmares of playing for Bama. 
I swear the Special Teams god hates Nick Saban. 
You think he would have made that if they hadn't centered it?
Anyone wana bet that kicker's twitter is deleted tomorrow morning?
How much money does that kicker have on Georgia? 
**HELLO** depression.
Who was the guy that came over and talked to him while he was warming up?
GET THE OT THREAD WARMED UP
Laces out 
4-D chess
Can you imagine the pressure? Arguably the most mentally strenuous position in football 
https://i.imgur.com/Sr9tYsU.gif
"fuck me, mother fucker" - Nick saban
*hooks to the left every fucking time*Let's put this shit in the middle of the field.
This is gonna haunt him for the rest of his life if Bama loses
"HELP I CAN'T BREATH" -Bamas kicker
COLLEGE KICKERS
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
MODS, WHERES MY OVERTIME THREAD
***MODS WHERE IS THE OT THREAD?***
GAME''S NOT OVER YET BOIS
Choke 
The film room is fun they are breaking down how his plant foot caused him to miss the kick
LETS GOOOO
Time to pop open another beer
LMAOOOO
If you make this kick, everyone is going to know your name James.My name is Steven.
Welp... you had it made. Then... college kickers.
I''m super confused by your flair. 
Hook em. Fuck Bama 
Keep Papanastos on murder suicide watch seriously. What the fuck was that. 
Somehow this is going to be Hurts fault for centering it too far.
For forcing me to stay up for overtime when I have work in the morning, I officially declare UCF national champions!
Awesome. Now I can stay up until 1am to watch Georgia lose instead of 12am. I have clinic at 5am tomorrow. This is going to suck. Maybe I should just go to bed. I have no horse in this race. 
Holy Shit!! That man can't kick a FG to save his life! Come on Dawgs!
FUCK BAMA
ROLL INCEST
OVERTIME OVERTIME OVERTIME COLLEGE FOOTBALL CONTINUES. THE FIFTH QUARTER. YES YES YES.
Wait, are you saying the refs are keeping Bama in this game?
I'll give you the PI. I won't give you the other stuff I've seen. 
Game ends in a tie.  UCF officially champions!
honestly what they get for playing for a FG with a shitty kicking game
#LOL
WHERE YOU AT BAMA FLAIRS?! WHERE YOU AT NOW?
Team Meteor and Lord Chaos had a baby.And it''s this game.!!''
PAPA NASTY DID IT FOR ME
Ahhhhhh yaaaaaaaaas
plus #48
Did you want more Georgia blowing lead jokes? Pappanotso fast my friend
I hate alabama but.. poor kid. Damn.
I'm honestly enjoying this, there's misery on both sides 
Gonna need an OT thread, this one is fucked
what the fuck is happening
God, I love having Nordin
HaHaHaHaHa(UCF)
CHOKE
fucking LOL
Saban is sending that kid and his entire family back to Greece 
I called it. What a joke.
I believe dawgs!
Nah, they don't kill family down there.
Keep drinking. Just switch to bloody Mary''s. That''s how we watch football in Hawaii
Hahahahahahaha no kidding
YOU'RE WELCOME MY CHILD
Buffalo Wild Wings wins again! 
The Alabama Shanks! My favorite
 Entire viewing party just jumped up and screamed with joy, followed by “fuck bama” chants. None of us even care about Georgia 
That kicks gonna haunt him for the rest of his life. God damn.
yes fuck some people still like cable..we get it...dilly dilly
Oh Bama... whatever you do, don't beat the kid up. He's doing that too himself more than anyone else could.
LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL JUST FUCK MY SHIT UP
how
WHERE'S THE LINK
Yay
Yes he definitely did
No /s
If they hadn't shifted left that woulda been good lol
I would hate to be a bama kicket
Dude you coulda had infinite blowjobs for life in Tuscaloosa and you literally fuck up a straight on kick. 
ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED???
Hello yeah 
Bet Bama wishes the refs could have moved the posts for them right there.
Laces #OUT!
I love how they showed Saban mouth “fuck me” when he whiffed that FG
yes
More like homicide watch lol
What's your state produce besides criminals?
SHOWS HOW DUMB I AM 
**THE FOOTBALL GODS ARE LOOKING DOWN UPON YOU GEORGIA! DO NOT DISAPPOINT THEM!**
This literally has to be scripted. You couldn't write a more suspenseful fucking game.
Damn. So much for going to bed at a reasonable hour!
I hate Alabama so bad but I feel bad for that kid. That will stick with him for life, whether they win or not. 
DO WE GET A NEW THREAD!?
He was wiping the sweat off his forehead while coming onto the field. That's nerves 
If bama loses imagine being that kicker walking around campus
Does Bama have a freshman kicker?
[deleted]
God has been confirmed everybody
Typical...
Link pls
Wouldn''t you?
I feel so bad for him, poor kid
No, I was talking about Bama
LETS FUCKING GO
I was ready to die listening to the radio call and then Euphoria 
Pappa Blessed.
Everytime we go to kick a field goal every Bama fan in the country gets triggered because of shit like that. Roll Tide though.
gyot damm
Not the first time I've seen Bama screw the pooch on a game winning field goal. I love this!
 Lol are you kidding me.  Saben must hate kickers
I CAN'T TAKE THIS
I wish Eddy went to Bama.
UGA DONT BLOW THIS
SHANKED THAT BITCH 
Can't believe he missed 
We''re going overtime boys 
He most definitely did
Comment of the thread here. 
And Seahawks. First round pick bby
Never ever talk to the kicker before the biggest kick in his life. 
Saban wondering what happened to the deal he had with the devil.
Saban right now "That kid isn't getting dinner"
So tired of this shit. So tired of trash ass kickers floating around on our team. 
Hahahaha.
I just don't understand.  They kept it right the whole set of downs.
Yes! Overtime here we come!
SUCK IT REFS
GO DAWGS
Papa will be found years from now locked in Sabins basement with Griffith
What do you do after that? Suicide.
As a Buccaneers fan, I know that pain Bama...
To be fair.... 35
Sadly probably ues
Someone get police protection for that kickers entire immediate family  get them out of the stadium now.   lives are in danger
[deleted]
Now that kicker just has to look forward to being elected senator

Holy. Fuck. That is inexcusable 
I hate kickers
Omg I was right!

If the kick was on the right hash....
Son of a bitch, Bama why couldn''t u just make that kick so we can go to sleep?
Oh my fucking god

#ONE MORE THREAD!
Neutral fans rejoice!
Oh man. That poor kid.
I bet you some redneck is already typing out death threats on FB
TIDE LEFT!
you would think a school like Alabama would be able to find a really good kicker. But they always seem to struggle with kicking
Glad he missed but poor guy :(
Surprised Alabama doesn't have an elite kicker. I thought they got good recruits?
LOL
OVERTIME THREAD PART 1 PLEASE.
I just came.
Wow. 
We getting an ot thread or going to try to break reddit in ot3? 
Nick saban may be one of the best college football coaches ever but he has the WORST luck with kickers. 
Why Red Bull was invented 
By never needing clutch kicks because they destroy every team they play. The pressure gets to them. 
[deleted]
WE GOT OVERTIME THIS SEASON WILL NOT DIE
Thank you dude at Buffalo Wild Wings. 
That poor kid is gonna get death threats.
I feel so bad for the kicker but I want Alabama to lose more so HAHAHAHAHA FUCK YES 
Megalul
I have to wake up at 6 am. This game better end soon.
Shit. I wanted to go to bed. But I still cheered when he missed. What can I say, my head and my heart want different things.
ALL ABOARD
The best part is the text under the gif "see more CHOKE gifs"
everyone is rooting with you, beat bama please!
With our kicker I'm going for it everywhere unless I choose to punt.
Hey off-season:  To the pit of misery!
The real loser here is my productivity at work tomorrow.
OVERTIME LEGGO
It's the P E L L E T S 
Haha what the hell is happening 
Mods fell asleep
I can't believe this world
Weird shit happens at midnight
Walshed it
Admit it, an all SEC NC Game is exciting as all get out!
But we like it here
Easy to feel bad for a kicker. He's gonna get reamed by people now, especially if Alabama loses
Hind sight is 20-20.
Lol maybe make the playoffs before you shit talk bama 
No reason indeed
These playoffs have been fucking LIT
How in the world does Bama continue to get anything less than the best kicker in the nation?This will always baffle me. 
Kid from Georgia playing the long con becoming the kicker at Alabama just to fuck them over
I just wanna go to bed, Nasty, goddamnit
Why didn't Saban change kickers at half!?  
Finkle is Einhorn
At least the Bucs won't try to draft him in the second round?^^^kill ^^^me
MODS!OVERTIME THREAD!FUCK!
As a lifelong Falcons fan he hates our whole fucking state man.
Consult your doctor if it lasts more than 4 hours.
They apparently didnt get the message
In 4 hours*
You ain't human if you don't feel bad for the kicker
Nick didn't have a tropical freshman kicky boi hanging around for that?
OVERTIME THREAD LET'S GOOOOOO
I feel like kickers have always been Alabama's weakness
Georgia better win in OT after the unholy shafting they received by the refs tonight
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha ALABAMA hahahahahahahah
Blair Walsh in collegiate form.
A lot of Viking fans do not approve.
Holy fuck I''m dead 
I'm rooting for georgia but I always feel really fucking bad for kickers who miss field goals like that
College kickers are so fucking trash. Hilarious lol
Alabama hasn't lost an overtime game in the playoffs
Sabans kickers suck
Even in another league we cannot escape his awfulness
MY GOD I DON'T CARE, I DON'T CARE, A MIRACLE IN MERCEDES-BENZ MY GOD A MIRACLE!
My god if Bama loses this game I really feel bad for this kid. Unfortunately we have people that take this shit too seriously.
The spirit of Blair Walsh is in the Superdome now
I'm losing years off my life...
One area Banana needs to take a hint from Auburn and put effort into recruiting a kicker. This was a gift Georgia, try not to fuck it up again *Noticed the autocorrect. Gonna leave it bc it's awesome
[Pappanastos misses game winning 36-yard field goal](https://www.clippituser.tv/c/qdqlyd)
Ref: "Immediately prior to the kick, uh... pass interference on the Georgia, automatic touchdown"
And that is why defeatist fans are the fucking worst.  Alabama fans were lamenting their inevitable loss then Georgia fans were too.  This is why you play the whole game.
I live for this 
this is the dankest fucking timeline.
BUT THERE ISNT ONE!
YESSSS
finkle is einhorn, einhorn is finkle
Kickers are people too. If anyone jumps in that kids mentions. they deserve their ass beat 
Does papa get his scholarship revoked immediately, or does he at least get one more quarter free?
Honestly couldn't even imagine being under that much pressure. Wow. Feel bad for him.
Oh my God I feel so bad for that kicker but man that is fucking HILARIOUS
LACES OUT, FINKLE
OMG college kickers yo I can't even right now
I never like it when team sports come down to one player...
What if I told you a missed kick could be the beginning of the end...ESPN 30 for 30 presents...
if they some how lose this game - they legit might be. 
What a call, nice one prophet
well, he did say force a TOUGH FG. That one should have been easy lol
holy shit dude better pray Bama wins because he will be hated forever 
Kicker felt bad for Georgia with the bad calls. He decided he'd give them another chance.
He was born with two left feet
I want off Papa Nasty's Wild Ride...
Saban is going to stab that kicker 
NOT YET BAMA
Out of all the damn comments in this thread... I run into this one lol. 
Every fucking year since like 2011 we have had shit for kickers. Cade Foster was alright until his complete collapse. Since then, nothing but trash.
This is a great game 
You think Saban subs in Tua for the kicker in OT also?
That kicker is a Greek tragedy
If we lose I''m deleting my account.
Is this real life?
I'M HARD
Kentucky just graduated the best kicker in school history. His hometown: Prattville, Alabama. 
Fuck me 
Uhhh....it ain't over yet
Alabama wasn't close enough to choke their one big game of the year. 4-loss Auburn beat them by double digits.
Hate that for that kid. Never want a game decided on a missed chippy FG. 
I need a beer and a cigarette.  I can't handle this shit.  
Should''ve run Najee instead of Tua on that last drive.
pappanastyasskick
Bama decides to sit on a 20-20 tie.Oops.
That player talking to the kicker right before the kick = secret agent saboteur confirmed
YAS
Georgia gonna win this now.
Unfortunately for Bama, this ain't prison! So I'm going with some gritty dawgs instead of a shanky boi.
He recruits great kickers. Then they get here and forget everything they ever knew about kicking. 
Not sure 36 yards is a chipshot. 
Ty
HOW DO YOU MISS THAT??? 
HE CHOKED!!!!

Overtime. I'm not getting to nap before I have to go to work in 1 hour and a half
LMAO
I do too but I run a highlight channel on YT so I will be up 2 hours minimum after this game fuck me
Fuck you. Fuck our kicker. FUCK EVERYTHIG
that poor kid
El oh El 
The true champs.
Me too 
Kid Rock is the Bull God
Pants = shit
Just declare UCF as National Champions. 
COLLEGE FOOTBALL''S NOT GONE YET FAM LETS GOOOOOOOO
So you are telling me..there is still a chance?
I feel so bad for that kid :(
You have to feel a little gutted for the kicker. Going home won't be easy, especially in Bama
Laces out?
I can't believe it. It had to happen
How does mighty Alabama, who gets all the best players, not have a reliable kicker?  Crazy. 
Hey you're a ute 
Man I feel pretty bad for the kicker, if they lose he's never gonna forget about that miss 
Go get a kicker teams. Don't just get a random Greek. Go get a kicker 
Start lining up his witness protection
Doctors recommended me not to watch anymore OT for the sake of the longevity of my heart. I will sit the rest out in the closet. 
These fucking kickers
Now you know my pain as a Viking fan... Except without all the losing...
agressively spanning /new for the overtime thread
Will Saban go with the 2nd string kicker in OT?
This does not help my the breaker odds in the family bowl pick em. I need this under 52 points if Georgia wins.
#48? Oh, wait. Never mind. 
Maybe both the kicker and Hurts will transfer to Michigan?
Explain this one atheists 
Need a gif of Saban saying "fuck me" after the miss
Alabama and missed field goals. Name a more iconic duo.
Now I see why ESPN's line was 86.6% for Bama winning there.
From getting any choice of poon for as long as he wants in that state to being a bum with one swift kick. 
THIS IS WHAT WE WANT
That's why people shouldn't call games early
COLLEGE FOOTBALL IS BACK ON THE MENU BOYS 
Fucking fuck
He misses? He misses!!
Prolong the collapse...
I just want to go to bed!!
BOO
Samir Naga-naga... notworkhere tomorrow!
Finkle is Einhorn
AHAHAHAHAHAHAHA AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHahHBBBBabbabbabbababBba
Alabama's kicker is ranked number one by people who say fuck Alabama!
Wowsers
But defense wins championships. Except tonight lol
Team Chaos for life
HAHAHAHAHAHA fuck Alabama.
Thank you football gods
I guess Alabama wasn't quite ready to accept UGA's chokejob. 
Over time me mommy
ha!
Yeah especially if they lose.
100%
lol nice i like this one
congrats on your championship
SHHH IT IS OVERTIME BABY
Now we can blow it in OT.
OVERTIME THREAD????
LOCK IT UP
poor papa =/
I think he'll probably drink himself into a coma tonight. No battle royale needed.
for memes, the best ever
Maybe they should've stayed at the right hash...? 
When did Blair Walsh get traded to Bama?
Well off to the overtime thread!
Holy shit, he will never live that kick down. If it wasn't Bama I'd feel bad for him.
God damn, the difference between college kickers and NFL kickers has a way larger gap skill wise than I thought they did. 
Last
So I've been following the box score, what happened? Bama was in field goal range with 6 seconds left
YES
They spend all their money buying skill position players and defense 
FTW!!
Can't kick?*Sigh*No, he's ours.
**PAPPANASTOS PAYING HOMAGE TO BLEWITT, I SEE YOU BRO**
Saban was just like "I had a feeling that was gonna happen"
That motherfucker chokes like no other lol. 
Alabama should start recruiting from soccer teams in the area. 
Papadapalapa on suicide watch
PAPPANAHTGUNNAMAKIT
Gotta give the Georgia fans a bit more hope so the pain is that much more, I guess.
DO WE GET AN OT THREAD NOW 
Someone give him the ncaa 14 manual 
Woooooo
It''s every game. Blatant as can be. 
its 1 am i need to SLEEP
NCG AFTER DARK
UCF would have hit that one easily. It's nice having a good kicker.
tHe GaMe''S oVeR, bAmA wOn
Just graduated and college activities still keeping me up way too late smh
I laughed 
You and I are used to missed kicks. I expect that out of Nordin.Oh right, that's not Nordin. That's a real kicker. Did Nordin kill their kicker and wear his skin to be in the title game?
48's temper
Why am I not surprised by us missing a fg.
If you look closely the salad falls in front of the glass door in that DTV commercial. Odd. 
I love this so much 
Fuck it, I didn't want to go to sleep anyways
GO DAWGS!!
Hold my beer! I'll be late tomorrow!
Ok
I mean yeah, imagine potentially blowing it for the one team you've wanted to play for your entire life
The were just saying before the kick he was never even offered a scholarship hahaha
Your team is required to have at least one glaring weakness.
[as a neutral fan](http://staticr1.blastingcdn.com/media/photogallery/2017/5/25/660x290/b_290x290/whats-rnbas-opinion-of-tyronn-lue-now-nba-redditcom_1348033.jpg)
Regardless of who you want to win that is fucking brutal for the kicker, man. 
Now I know who Seahawks are gonna replace Walsh with
Thank God I can go late into work tomorrow.
MY BODY CAN'T HANDLE THIS 
Alabama get 20 attempts for a touchdown while Georgia has to try and not draw a BS penalty from the refs.

Dude come on
Don't put that evil on me!
How do you guys not always have the best kicker in CFB?
He's from Georgia you say?FOR MY PEOPLE!!!!!!!*misses*
At the stroke of midnight, no less!
You know why don't we just not talk about bad kicking 
Paul George there, OT tonight 
I don't get what the point was to run left on the play before the field goal. You should have kept it on the right hash
Yup
HELL YEAH!!
That was THE WORST kick I''ve ever seen LOLOLOLOLOL 
Bama settled so hard there at the end. Georgia couldn't stop them from moving down the field and still they got all conservative at the 18 yard line and ran down the clock...they could've gotten a much closer FG
A D S A D S #ADS ADS ADS!
AND WE ARE GOING INTO OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOVERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRTIMMMMMMMMMMEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This!
That poor fuck
This isn't a pro kicker it's a college kid so chill Bama fans.
Why do Bama always have bad kickers. Their Achilles heel. 
Washington Husky fans be like - Kickers
Honestly, I think there's a real chance it would have been blocked had he kicked it straight
Stay up till 8!
OT THREAD
OMG
REPEAT: SABAN CANNOT PULL A DANTONIO
Does Philip Doyle have any eligibility left?
>I love god 'now'>texas CHRISTIAN universitysomething doesn't add up
Should have thrown the ball and not let it come down to a kicker.
How are Georgia fans surviving this game? 
Man, do I feel for Pappanastos. Yeah, I hate Bama, but that kid probably just had the worst moment of his life. 
That must be the worst feeling in the world 
Ray Finkle....
WHERE IS IT 
wish i'd been watching the Saban feed at that moment too.
I have a post from earlier explaining it. Since the season is nigh-over I'm okay spilling the beans on this specific account.
Dilly dilly
UCF HAS BETTER KICKER THAN BAMA
Where is the OT thread?! Mayhem is back!
I would like to thank God, and also Jesus 
YOU'RE NOT MY SUPERVISOR 
Amen brotha!
r/conspiracy
Imma need a Saban saying “Fuck Me” gif 
this game is so stupid
Alabama Fans killed TREES for less! 
in OT advantage Georgia. They got a better Kicker lol
Damn I haven't seen something skew that far left in Alabama since the Moore/Jones Senate campaign results
Dawgs better pull it off now yall got new life
I saw that too!
I feel for the Bama kicker tbh. He was terrible tonight but he's going to be so hated back in Alabama if they don't pull out the win tonight.
Who gave Connor Barth a Bama jersey???
#HOLY SHITTY FUCKING SHIT
Damn, title #6 was right in Saban''s grasp
Well, this football game brings back nightmares...
God doesn't like Bama anymore. You're cursed. 
Workin overtime
blood for the blood god
I honestly feel bad for that kid... For real, change your name and move out of the country, especially if the Bulldogs end up winning this.
I am in full tears having a breakdown over here. Holy crap!!
You see Nick''s mouth “Fuck Me”
Good thing that kicker isn't on scholarship, otherwise Nick takes that shit. 
No you don't. 0% of you hates to say that you called it. 
LULZ. 5 stars at every position, but still tempt fate with lifetime season ticket holders at kicke
Blair Walsh?! Is that you?
I don't get it. It's Alabama, they get the best players every year. How the fuck do you not have a good kicker?
If they passed the ball to try for a TD, sure you might give Georgia the ball back with time, but you should know you have a terrible kicker. I'm not complaining though.
BANG. DING. OW.
Last
Ou est-il?
CHAOS REIGNS
Holy shit 9 month old baby Jesus is light
If Bama loses in OT, he will have to move out of the state 
Just had a flashback to the state/Clemson game last year.
I''ll never understand how Bama can have damn near all 5 stars on the two deep, but can never find a kicker. 
I got a feeling this guy would miss it after they refused to run a real play on 3rd down and just ran down the clocktua is a great player, but his time management is... suspect
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOoooooooooooooo
I was thinking the same thing, guy was sending off huge nervous vibes. 
Poor guy''s probably gotten thousands of death threats already 
Best team in college football forgot to recruit a decent kicker, oops
Heart not working. 
Was rooting for the kid to make it.
Kicking. It just means more. 
LINK IT
pls
word thanks my man im getting into football this year and all the playoff controversy was pretty confusing 
##CFP**AFTERDARK**
Breaking news: Alabama spends all of its academic budget in recruiting kickers
Ugh fuck you guys I have to wake up at 6
If you make that kick, you gain an unshakable confidence that will last you a career. If you miss that kick you just guaranteed your need for a new career path.
Make the damn OT thread!
I didn't even realize how long the FG was. When he said it was 36 yards, not a gimme
Very high
It seriously must have been part of Saban''s deal with the devil that he cannot ever have a good kicker. 
Kicker from Georgia missing a 36 yarder with 3 seconds left in Atlanta? The long con!
If only we had mentioned he is a lifelong Bama season ticket holder maybe he''d have made that fg
The Falcons went to overtime too...
Don''t let this tied game distract you from the fact that the Falcons blew a 25 point lead. 
Hit us with that link.
Yes!
True bama fans knew it was coming. We''ve missed game deciding Fg kicks so often we just understand we''re losing or going to OT
I may consider leaving the state if I were him. Ooof 
This is like a movie right now
GOOD GOD HAVE WE SEEN TOO MUCH OF THAT THIS SEASON
I wanted Georgia to win but now i would just feel bad for that kicker.
An eight-month overtime would be great, thanks
ESKETITTTT
It's Georgias game to win
It's a good thing it's such a common name, I'm sure nobody will be able to find them on Facebook or the phone book
Isn't he a senior academically too?
I didn''t even want to watch this game in the first place :(
Should have used a true freshmen kicker there. 
Should have kept it on the right hash.
Kick would have been good if they stayed on the right hash mark.
I don't blame the kicker, Nick recruited him.
Thank you lord Reeekis
**BRING ON THE OT THREAD**
I JUMPED UP IN THE AIR AND SMACKED MY HEEL ON MY CHAIR AND NOW ITS ALL PURPLE #WORTHIT
Unbelievable 
THEY SAY YOU DON'T CHOOSE THE APP, THE APP CHOOSES YOU
Yeah but if they didn''t center it up he would be aiming more left and then if he shanks it left the same amount he still misses. The better statement is if he didn''t choke he wouldn''t have missed it
Either that or his freshman QB cost him with bad clock management.
iT jUsT mEaNs MoRe
Might have made it if they don''t run that last play to the middle of the field. 
Should've put in the true freshman kicker...
I can hear people on my floor losing their shit
"If there's no God, then what are all these churches for? And who is Jesus's dad?"
There will never be a day that I enjoy watching field goals. Ever. In my life. EVER
This is too much drama. Even for a Georgia sports fan. 
Ouch, well played
Full blown foot AIDS.
This is going to be underwhelming as fuck if Georgia doesn't win now.
Wowwwww
Why do these games always have to end so late...
did you see that coach down on one knee behind him praying before the kick?lol thanks god
Same
It''s wide left. Gotta pan out to see it. 
Seeing Alabama fail made me so happy.  I don't think it should, but I laughed out loud.  
That guy will never live this moment down as long as he lives. He is Ray Finkle. 
This is the greatest thing ever, thank you football gods
When was the last time we had OT in the nati??
Naaaaaah. You don't.
Classic
Shankopotamus
do they have Witness Protection on site at these games along side the ambulances? 
My god is that Blair Walsh out there?
Should have done a fake behind the head toss ;)
It's his fault 
That's the spirit
Refs have been decent imho
JT Barrett would have willed that Kick through the up rights. 
[I fucking knew it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/7p36ds/game_thread_cfp_ncg_georgia_vs_alabama_8pm_et/dse7v76/)
Lmao that was amazing 
Fuck me
He will get lynched when he gets back to campus
No kidding. All the talk of him missing and even if I want Georgia to win gotta feel bad for him. Here's a guy not much older than me with all these fans hoping he hits it and to miss It? That's gotta be crushing, I can't even imagine.
indeed
Immediate transfer. And it won't be him applying for it 
Dude has yanked it far left twice, and both times it should''ve been hit right down the middle... win or lose he''s going to be thinking about this night For eternity. 
Probably. He won't take blame at all if questioned. I guarantee it. 
BY GAWD MAYHEM IS BACK!!
Checkmate atheists. There is a god and he is fucking evil.
wheres the ot thread
OH MY
LAST
Dear Vikings: Please draft this kid when Forbath inevitably blows it. 
i'm confused about how you think your comment makes any sense.
AM I IN
Alabama got gano''d
Will Saban sacrifice the kicker on the 50 before the coin toss?
Corso: “Not so fast!”
Pappa Nasty is going to be crucified back in Tuscaloosa

We can only hope
Omg the RNG
fucking garbage....related to blair walsh probably
Fuck me. It''s 1am here and I have an early morning to go diving. Please UGA make this a quick OT. 
ALABAMA KICKERS SUCK
Don't like alabama much but damn that's gotta be horrible to go through 
I'm just glad it didn't lose the game, maybe he'll have a chance at redemption 
He's gonna go full laces out.
How does such a good team so consistently fail to recruit/develop players at such an important position?
UCF's kicker would have made it. Just saying.
Georgia with the field goal luck. 
Is this the karma paying Georgia fans something for as much as they have suffered last year against NFL's Alabama?
Holy fuck dude
LACES OUT, DAN!
Just delaying the suffering. 
make me
this shit is Tua's fault for not knowing how to center the ball. Saban then exploded in anger and absolutely rattled their kicker.
You mean two is awesome!

Shanked it left.

I''m gonna off myself Jesus Christ

HAHA WHEN YOU WORKED ALL WEEK AND REALIZE THAT THIS GAME IS A COMMERCIAL BREAK BEHIND
We should have loaned Bama Eddy for this game.
Waiting!
He can always become a woman named Einhorn.
Fuck work! CFP after dark!
must be really tough to be a Bama fan right now. you gonna be ok?
TAKE TURNS WITH THE BALL FROM THE 25. IT GOES UNTIL SOMEONE MISSES OR TURNS THE BALL OVER. AFTER 3OT YOU HAVE TO GO FOR 2 ON A TD. sorry for caps
Fuck man, not even mad at the kid. I'm anxious as shit sitting on my couch buzzed, can't imagine him.
Put the fuckin ball in Fromms fuckin hands now
The ghost of bad kicking will haunt saban for his whole life if they lose this game
I had no idea that the runner-up from the initial season of American Idol is the little sweet guy from the Dr. Pepper commercials.  Crazy!
We'll take a few more gifts for that questionable third quarter of reffing
Think: papa nasty didn't get offered by Alabama, so he went to ole Miss, where his team got smacked by Bama. Now he's infiltrated them and is making sure they never win another championship. It's the classic long con.
Im glad, I have beer and alprazolam.
Juuuuuuust a bit outside
My reddit app crashed from all the comments lol 
Especially with the incestuous Bama fans.
That kid was shook.
LACES OUT DAN
Hurt comes back in, Bama falls apart. Who put a curse on that man?
Is there going to be an Overtime Thread for us trolls and hobgoblins? 
This is a trash game, missing that field goal was the most SEC thing I've ever seen

Hahahhahahahahahahahhaha
so we all booging in the 4th quarter thread or is there an OT thread lol 
haha it's already happening guaranteed
Or a touchdown
At least they''re a totally reasonable fan base following losses
I want 3+ OTs and for it to come down to the 2 pt rule fucking someone over so we can have controversy all throughout the offseason. :D
absolutely :'(
Did you see that dude nervously Tebowing right next to him practicing kicks? WTH
Lol seriously. Did dude tell him the team was gonna kick his ass if he missed?
That''s Satan, and Saban sold his soul...
My prayers were answered.  Now Georgia just needs to take advantage of the situation.
Literally knew before the kick he'd miss. We can not kick field goals, period. Occasionally, we'll get lucky and somehow the ball makes it through, but our standard is pathetic. 
Never seen a thread move this fast 
Kirby will speak of hope, Saban will speak of death.
Lmaaaoooo
SHITTTTT!!
Papagonelefto's shanked it
This game is awesome 
This dude is garbage.Get him off the team, hahaha.
FUUUCK these ads
If 'Bama loses that kicker will get it in the showers. They'll make him eat a whole soap on a rope.
To be fair the entire state of Georgia was giving him the hex eye. 
Hope the troopers outside his parent's house are Auburn fans tonight. 
That's probably his make percentage?

I'm sure they have a 5 star freshmen kicker in a bin somewhere they can swap him for  
So does Alabama's kicker.    Ouch
Someone get Pappanastos into witness protection
GOGGLES WOULDA MADE IT ILL TELL YA THAT RIGHT NOW 
Sports gods plz
His plant foot looks reeeaaally too far inside there. So his swing went way too left. At least how I saw on my blurry stream. 
wtf why. it's his job. he did not do it
Everyone has a better kicker than Bama
At the start of this drive I made a $10 bet with some guys that Bama would march the field, settle for a field goal, and whiff spectacularly. Today is a good day
Fuck you ESPN for taking that field goal miss away from me
FIFTH QUARTER
Agreed. Every kick this kid made tonight was going to the left.
HE MISSED
apology for bad English.    Where were you when saban kills his kicker?    "Bama is kill" Yes. 
I feel like I should hate these Dr. Pepper commercials... but I really don''t.

How does Alabama always have bad kickers
Somebody shut off the band it's giving me anxiety. 
C L U T C H 
Name it Fifth Quarter, or this has all been for naught.
You'd think, but he'd be aiming differently and the way he kicked that I'm not even sure he gets it out if the end zone
I couldn't imagine being a fan of either of these two teams right now. With that said, LET'S GO GEORGIA. 
Is nowhere safe?
I've said it before and I'll say it again: Pappanastos is an Ole Miss sleeper
Poor kicker man 
Lil Sweet needs to give Fromm the sweet taste of diet Dr Pepper so he plays well in OT

I would be too 
Isn't* 
Really comes back to bite in games like this. 
Saban's refusal to recruit a decent ~~kicker bites~~ kicking coach him in the ass again?
Oh shit. And of course they have another true freshman behind him that seems to be a damn scary qb to game plan for...

Link goddamn it!
OUR HEARTS
Is this real life?
Taking bets on whether the bama kicker makes it back to the state of Alabama 
Man
OT MEANS MORE AD MONEY STAY WOKE FAM 
They can have the Utes kicker as long as we get our share of the Championship. Utes 2017!!!
But where is it?
Oh man if they lose... I really don't think he'll be allowed back in Tuscaloosa.
you're a Georgia fan today, friend
I wouldn't have it any other way.
I just know that poor kid will get death threats from crazy assholes and I feel bad for him.
That missed field goal takes me back to Maldonado''s days at Oregon... *shudders*
Dear Nick,Please give me a scholarship to kick for the football team. I can miss field goals better.
worst FG attempt I've ever seen
Lolololol
Whew. Got my chance to pee. My body is ready. #woofwoof
i am ded
JUST A REMINDER:Alabama should still be down by at least 14 from that bullshit punt call earlier. 
I've fucken seen it all
Where is it?
So true. That shit got to him. 
He goes to practice kicking all day and gets his college paid for while doing it. You gotta make those. 
still got OT to redeem himself
I bet my dad $5 he would miss. My net worth has risen 50%
Bama is a fucking dynasty but yet they struggle to get a damn consistent field goal kicker. How? 
This man is close to bartman status. Yikes 
I feel like the dude in this diet dr. pepper ads saying "It's the sweet one" is supposed to be telling me something I don't know but, can pretty much figure what it is...
My first LSAT class is tomorrow morning. I have nothing less to offer you
Had to get Hurts in for the W
Y''all make sure we forget him when we leave tomorrow 
Ha I just said to myself, I can finally goto bed. Aaaand he missed it.
Looks like a little whale
OK, Georgia, however you managed to fuck up in the second half there, don't do that.
Oh man I seriously fear for him right now.  When ECUs kicker missed multiple field goals in their bowl loss to Arkansas a few years ago, his life was ruined.  Bama is like 20x ECU holy shit the horror if they lose
Holy shit the comments are coming in by the hundreds
Damn, shoulda stayed on the right hash
I hate him just like i hate every fucking kicker we have had recently. Jesus fucking christ can we get a god damn kicker for fucking once
He was missing that kick either way lol. 
They all play soccer. Getting a golfer is their best option.
Poor kid, that's gonna haunt him for the rest of his life if Bama loses in OT
Pappa just did y'all nasty 
left the room for the kick. Im a jinx. Spending the rest of this game in the bathroom. GO DAWGS
College kickers. Can''t count on them, ever. Ever. 
Where is the OT thread?
Not to mention the death threats he gets if the Tide loses this game in overtime. 
I have a post explaining it.Since the season is basically over I don't mind spilling the secret I've been "researching".I like to do mini-research projects throughout the season.I had two this year. One for a local paper and this one just for me and fun.
Peep the trainer behind Papanostsiandbf saying a quick Tebow prayer before the shank. Poor Paps gonna have to transfer to a different continent
Fukn Blair Walsh right there
JUUUUUUUST A BIT OUTSIDE
I'm tempted to turn the tv off and put on a stream just to stop the commercial cancer
I love College Football
Who /overtime/ here ??
Dude. Yes. It's so great.
That Bama kicker is Darth Vader in Episode 6 sacrificing himself to kill the Emperor (Bama) to save the good guy Luke Skywalker (Georgia.) 
this kicker is fucking SHOOK lmaoooo
The biggest choke job ever 
Me
:'( that's gotta be traumatizing, poor kid
Pretty sure UTEP has a better kicker than Bama.
Haha yeah. Despite the flair I'm not super attached to any cfb teams (more of nfl fan). Just wanted to see a good game, but the missed calls have really soured it for me. 
Omg lmao
pls
Not so fast, my friend!
It's how we sustain ourselves.
Hold that thought we got a chance
lol Saban gonna send that 48 to woop that kicker ass
That's what they get for brining out Hurts to touch the ball again 
HAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAAHAHAHHHHAHAH
Make it so
LMAO saw that guy too.
He Walsh''d it. 
If only
WHERE IS IT
If the lights go out can we just say neither team wins?
We staying, we going?
I mean they are kids, it's not surprising the pressure gets to them. Should cut them some slack.
No
ZING!!!
I mean, I'm a Georgia fan, but I'm not salty. I'm proud of my Dawgs, just disappointed in the refs missing those calls (mainly that facemask)
Is UCF national champions? 
Choke so hard the other team chokes. UGA is playing 7d chess while we're all playinc checkers
Tfw Shane beamer might get a NC ring before his dad 
I thought the number one rule was don''t schedule NDSU
SVP: "Football is a timed game played on a 100 yard field. CFB gets to overtime and becomes neither."
O/U death threats to the kicker at 6.5?
Saban literally said "oh fuck me"
That poor kid 
WHERE THE FUCK KS THE OVERTIME THREAD
God DAMMIT.  I'm so happy but I have to be at work in 7 hours...
Where is the overtime thread?
WHERE IS IT?
Yea that was dumb. Just let him stay in his zone
Aaaand he did lol
Nugent was a beast.
Way past his bed time.
Bama has obviously looked like the better team late in the game. I feel like this is just prolonging the inevitable. 
Buffalo Wild Wings at it again!
Moar football
Yeah I fuckin had Taco Bell now imma about to puke that shit up. Thanks TB
ya'll miss eddy? HUH?
Where's the FSU PTSD missed FG kicks cost you National Championships at?
I always forget how much I love field goals 
Yes. Absolutely yes
lol the kicker chokes in his last game 
Woooooo
WE DONT HAVE MOMENTS
More proof UK should have been in this game.
So, it really looks like 'Bama should have run as far right as possible--and then launched the long snap further right and had Papa-whatever kick it "straight" from the right OOB line. He might have hit the kick right down the center!
Georgia is the king of overtime 
LOL. Ball don''t lie.
Lol people acting like we lost. Anyways, overtime time baby
Dude he is a Georgia kid who just missed a game winning field goal for Bama. He is already getting death threats. 
If they lose, I think he has to pay for his ride home, and for last semester.
FSU and missed field goals?
https://youtu.be/2EwViQxSJJQ?t=25s
Bring it!
That's what I was wondering. As much as I dislike Alabama, I kind of hope they win, so that kid can go on to live a normal life. 
NO WINNERS EXCEPT THE SPONSORSDR PEPPER YOU''RE GETTING YOUR MONEYS WORTH
I've been to Alabama and I know it's nothing at at all like Hawaii lol
Saban iced his own kicker essentially 
Laces out, Dan!!!!
He's from Alabama and his family are long time Alabama fans and season ticket holders. They mentioned that like 5 times. 
thanks big guy. it''s late. but I appreciate it. 
One more hour of commercials
This primetime commercial is cringey as fuck.
You're not my real dad 
brutal
Surprised saban didn't murder him  before he made it back to the sideline
They missed! 
Stay clocked in
You know when you go to bed and think of all the dumb shit you've done or all things you wish you could do over? This is gonna be with him for the rest of his life. Fuck that would suck.
I wonder what that guy who was kneeling and very obviously praying right behind the kicker practicing is thinking now
if only there were composite 5 star kickers Alabama could recruit
OT thread is a prank
After midnight, we gonna let it all hang out!  SHAKE IT!!!
Where is our OT thread?
Bama's kicker gotta transfer if they lose in OT
You got lucky with the 7 no calls tonight for sure
feel bad for the kid regardless of team on those. ugh. cant imagine the pressure
Shoutout to the west coast boys. Only 9pm yeee
UCF confirmed national champion.  No losses, no ties. 
Let's go to overtime!-Buffalo Wild Wings
Dear lord baby Jesus. Thank you. For hearing my prayer!!
Cmon baby, give me another hit of that CFB
Overtime thread?
HURRY HURRY
Team Meteor and Lord Chaos had a baby!!!!
Anarchy! 
Tell the zebras
No one knows
Missed
Dawgs more experienced in OT in playoffs, Dawgs 34-30
Poor kid. 
No righteous and good God would allow a national championship game between 2 SEC teams. This whole game is proof there is no God. 
You either got ice in your veins or you don't 
Looked like it would have been good if they didn't move the ball between the hashes.
I find it amazing how Power 5 schools have such bad kicking. 
Complete the sentence:True _____
MOOOODSSS
I know he got a ton of death threats and ppl harassed his family. it was never that serious, at least not for fans. still hate him though
East coasters should get a day off tomorrow
The real Greek Freak
ray finkle's kick. 
Don't you use that reverse jynx! 
ITT: 0 Bama fans freaking out about Pappanastos. We don't expect out kickers to succeed. 
Almost identical to the first one too
I had respect for Saban. Good coach, appeared to be a good person, but then he lets someone who threw a punch at a player and tried to attack a coach back in?? Like wth
Is that Blair Walsh out there?

Lol
There's always that chance to redeem himself. It will all be forgotten if he wins it in OT
I want to say I''m surprised. 
You''d think the “greatest college football coach in history” would recruit a kicker after 9 years. 
ESPN: Overtime means more commercial$ :)
Bama still gonna win doe
This game is playing for the rest of time in Valhalla
30 for 30: no,  but you could imagine what it would be like. 
Yeah, but nobody deserves threats for a football game. 
lol Saban always getting screwed by his kickers.
Didn't realize USF's kicker had transferred to Alabama since Nov. 24. 
#FuckBlairWalsh
Watch, Bama''s kicker is gonna miss a FG in overtime now 
Lmao
hahahhaha Hurts fucked you and you didn't even know it
Fuck everything else. Upvoting this. Had to switch to the finebaum cast and/or the sound of the game. Regular stream is unwatchable.
ARE YOU LAST
Not the superdome my dude
Where are you?
> Know if there''s any video on twitter or something? I missed it bc I was ~~shitposting~~ doing God's work.FTFY
More than half the time the person who gets the snap is the one running the ball. Even if not, he is more of a running threat. The reason why it doesn''t work is because there is basically no passing threat so safeties stack the box 
It lessens the blow when you know he is gonna miss before he kicks it.
Just commenting for posterity, I was here
Missed 2 field goals this game. Either would have won
Us and kickers. Lawd. 
God dammit, somebody shoot Little Sweet.
Go Dogs!
If I'm that dude, I'm thinking about what programs out west I can transfer to. Preferably beyond the Rocky Mountains. 
How will I live without college football 
Refs to Bama: "We did all we could for you and this is how you repay us?!?!!"
As a guy with no horses in this race, this all turned because of three Bama benefited missed calls in 4 plays in the third:1. Blocked punt that was negated because of the incorrectly called offside (caused by non-called false start)2. Next play uncalled PI on Bama3. 2 calls later uncalled personal foul on Bama. All in the favor of Bama. That series took a huge opportunity for UGA and effectively negated the series. Let alone the shocking number of poor calls in the last two series'. I understand the want of officials not to determine the winner, but you still have to officiate equally.
wow
I believe it was Ohio state v Miami 15 years ago
I remember that one
Kyle Brotzman 2.0
No ads in the coaches stream!
You''re correct. He was nervous that''s for sure. Not saying I can do any better but man.... that was bad. 
I can''t unsee it hahahah
20k
Not me. I got work tomorrow. 
"no fuck to give"
They're probably reviewing it as we speak 
Its cool hearing the coaches talking about how they handle their kickers missing field goals.
If Georgia wins that kicker from Alabama is going to be getting death threats from Bama fans.
HOW DO YOU MISS THAT FIELD GOAL
A hoax
That's why he yelled at the quarterback for wasting all that time
I wonder what's being done to Pappa's dorm room right now.
My heart sank when he pushed the kick. Feel bad for the kid.
Go all in for doge coin
Yes
this is why you need to recruit a kicker and not another 6''5 running back, nick.
Lee Corso: "Not so fast my friend"
WAIT!! Freshmen played in THIS GAME??? I had no idea
man I can't win
They should've pulled out the true freshman kicker. 
What''s with bama and shitty kickers?
Unbelievable. Every fucking year.
Overtime''s back on the menu, boys!
He's not allowed to win big games with special teams.
Are you not entertained? Cause I''m losing years off my life here...
Brutal. 
Im telling you the players coming up to him while he was warming up screwed him over, they didnt let him warm up and they got him so nervous
AHHHHHHH
Rip
Ohhh poor thing one less national championship 
UCF Natty champs\*omg i did it
please put the kicker in the witness protection program asap
Hey guys
That kicker will never be allowed to live in Alabama ever again

We completely dominated the second half and a kicker is gonna waste it all, ugh

Go Georgia!
DAWG DOWN
I'm so goddamn tired but I can't go to sleep yet.
A Greek tragedy for that kicker
I just want to go to bed 
Georgia fans are gonna be on heart attack watch after the semi-final plus this game going OT
The leaking roof caused the missed FG
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp87kFSPbGA
That poor kid is going to have a rough couple of months if Georgia goes on to win this game
Getting late enough for some Taco Bell tbh
It ASTOUNDS me that Nick Saban can never find a good fucking kicker.
Blair Walsh has risen from the dead.
Any georgia fans have heart attacks yet?
I want pap to be one of my pallbearers so he can let me down one more time 
I, like, can’t even right now 
Lets go boys
This is why I hate watching games with casuals. My neighbors just said: "so it's not over? Well, we're falling asleep, so we're headed home."
That kicker better have some security because someone is gonna kill him
Bama is probably going to need him again in OT. Can't imagine trying to bounce back after missing the National Championship winning kick.
lawl tide
Fade my liver fam
I'll admit at the beginning of the game, I didn't think this OT thread would happen, but hey, more football, right?*clutches chest*...jeez, and I'm a neutral, too.
If I was Papanastos I would be crying my fucking eyes out right now
Unbelievable lol. Get that guy a security detail if Georgia wins 
Refs can’t cheat your shitty kick into the uprights 
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHHA THIS IS UNREAL
Do we get a Seperate thread for each ot? 
Finish the drill!
HERE WE GO LADS
Let Papa Nasty Cap this
Thanks to the Alabama kicker for making this a fun game.
Georgia better hope they lose this toss, because we are going to double OT
I’m watching this with a couple bama fans... they aint happy 
2/3 playoff games are instant classics.  We may live in a meme reality, but at least the games are intense.
In the words of Seth Rollins I love football.
Tri natty awarded to Bama UCF and UGA
I have no cable or internet right now, but I got you guys! I'm imagining all of the salt from everywhere! It pleases me 
Im gonna die
Upvote this because you saved it 
What are the warning signs for a stroke again?
Georgia fans having some hardcore Falcons flashbacks to the Super Bowl right about now
What even is this
I would’ve made that kick
Man, I feel so damn bad for that kicker.  Brotzman is still a curse word in Boise. 
I'm strapped in for this wild ride.
Please Georgia ball second 
Why reward him for bad behavior?
Should've had a chance. 
WHO CLICKED THE BDUBS BUTTON?Thank you
That kick swung harder than 48's punch.
#THERE IS A GOD
True Freshman Fromm has overtime experience on his side

I hate sports sometimes
Well, this football game brings back nightmares...
We deserve more people 
How does this start off in favor of Alabama? 
See 0 Comments.. Refreshes 500 just posted. Oh my
Pappanastos better get some police protection after the game if they lose this
My dog went to bed at the beginning of the 4th quarter.  Dumbass doesn't know what he's missing.
It's amazing how much people hate Bama. I'm just sitting here hating Georgia.
Man, I feel for that kicker. Poor kid. 
I want a Homers stream for every game.  So much fun.
answered prayer
Dudes pushing kicks far left in a god damn dome LOL 
If Bama loses ..I'm excited to see what the mods do
I blame the player who was giving the kicker the pep talk
ok I'm happy he missed but I feel terrible for Pappa, dude was solid all year and it comes down to this...
Damn, work should be fun tomorrow on 5 hours sleep.
The 2017-2018 season lives on!
GEORGIA, THE FALCONS DIED FOR THIS AND THE FOOTBALL GODS HAVE BLESSED YOU WITH ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY. DON'T FUCK IT UP.
East coast: “Why they make the game so lateeee?”Everyone else: “lol”
I was sure it would be game over, but oh well, go Dawgs! 
Looks like a tie to me, just give UCF the trophy now
They should switch ref teams for OT. FUCK THEM BAMA REFS
Alabama starts their third QB of the night.
Watch bama cover now lol
UGA you fucking assholes
Nothing.
48 isn't a bama captain?
Bama fans are going to poison that kicker
We had a Pappanastos on our team too, but his name was Blewitt. The only difference is our kicker had a far more appropriate name.
#FUCK BAMA
Should have brought in the true freshman kicker
Is there anyone that still doesn't know the overtime rules?
Here comes the Kiffin Kurse ladies and gents!

TUESDAY MORNING OFFICIALLY LET'S GOOOOO
I LOVE COLLEGE FOOTBALL
That was lame ref 
FUCK ALABAMA
Come on dawgs!
TWO TRUE CHAMPIONS
They’re going for a tie!
G L O R YLORY
first
HOW WILL BAMA SCREW UP THE REFS IN THEIR POCKETS THIS TIME
Bama players can't handle the pressure. OG goggles boy is going to win the game. 
Hush up, you already won your national championship. Let the rest of us have this.
May the OT gods shine upon us so that we shall have 17 OT's!
College OT rules > all other OT rules 
Total shankapotomus
Okay, this is a much better all-SEC national championship than the last one
HERE WE FUCKING GO BOYS
As a neutral fan, OT was all I wanted.
Buck Fama
Paul George is furious
I can't
there is no escape
Another player on the sideline
UCF national champions now? 
Hot damn how many elderly Georgia fans have died due to heart failure in the last two weeks 
"To the left, to the left" - Beyonce.
We have a champion its UCF
I'm just here for CHAOS
Must suck to be a kicker man.   So much goddamn pressure 
LETS. FUCKING. GOOOOOOOO. 
KEK WILLS IT
Papanastos is a sleeper agent 
HERE I GO KILLING AGAIN
That poor bed
They should just call it a tie 
Cool point by Cutcliffe in the film room, you cant really get into your kicker after a miss, just like a relief pitcher you are gonna need them to go win you a game real quick again and you got to worry about that not what just happened. 
Gonna be fun when Bama needs a FG in OT
[deleted]
Gotta feel for Pappanastos there. Dude is about to be immortalized for a miss. 
[Who You Gonna Call?](https://botw-pd.s3.amazonaws.com/styles/logo-thumbnail/s3/0015/6509/brand.gif?itok=3kqYAUhH)
Does anyone else wish Joe Tessitore would replace Herbstreet?
FUCK YEAH BOYS, WHO IS READY FOR GEORGIA TO WIN?   (lol I know Bama will still win in soul crushing fashon)
I made it to the thread
At least Popponoppoloppoloppolop is a rare name and nobody will be able to find them easily
I'm glad I'm not Bama's kicker right now
LETS GO DAWGS
I thought 2018 was going to continue the darkest timeline. There’s still hope!
AM I DREAMING, OR DID HE ACTUALLY MISS
IF WE COULD KEEP THIS GAME GOING UNTIL MAYBE SEPTEMBER THAT'D BE GREAT
Did anyone watching a stream find out about OT before the kick even happened? 
That kicker is walking back to Tuscaloosa if nick Saban has anything to say about it 
It’s ok Papa Nasty 
Mark Richt has lost control of overtime.
The ref could not fucking wait to say that lame ass line
Alright...alright...who hit the buffalo wild wings button? 
What about UCF
Come on UGA! Win one for America!
10 OT LET'S GO
I will give up my unborn firstborn for a Dawgs win
Kick worse than the Kendrick Lamar halftime show
Chaos!!!
Not the hero we deserve...
I will hang Christ on the fucking cross myself if Alabama doesn't pull this one from it's ass
All those great recruiting classes and you can't find a decent kicker.
I am the only one awake in my house. Fuck!!!
At this point idc who wins. It's been great so far though!
I hate bama as much as the next guy but fuck man, that sucks for bamas kicker. Hate to see that either way
Please play defense Georgia and score this time
I hope kicker misses it in OT.
Alabama's current kicking situation is going to end up being the reason college kids can start being paid to play revenue sports. 
Should have kicked from the right hash...
Meanwhile our former kicker just scored 38 of 42
Pappanastos? 
/r/wholesomememes
Shit it so hard the next 3 kickers we have will be trying to shake that shit.
The kicker will be right there with Jalen on Last Chance U next season
Everyone have your thread jump buddy?
Don't let Georgia blowing a 13-0 lead distract you from the fact that Atlanta blew a 28-3 lead.
Bama should have never let Eddy slip away
OT drink time
We need to start a go fund me for the kicker, because I don’t think his scholarship will still be there come tomorrow. 
What was the last overtime rule? About going for 2?
Well that is like your opinion, and probably everyone elses
Hey Georgia, Run. The. Ball. 
Watch 48 make the game winning play
Way to not be funny ref.
That kicker is getting force choked by Saban as we speak
OT thread boutta move so fast nobody will know I sharted during that field goal 
can reddit's servers even handle OT?
Alabama should never attempt a game winning field goal
What’s with bama and shitty kickers?
That was the most beautiful shanked FG attempt eveeeeeer! Pretty sure neighbors on all sides of me heard me scream! FINISH IT, DAWGS!!! 
Well it's all good... I was just thinking this game hasn't dragged on long enough.
I don't get why these coaches play it so conservative towards the end of games.  I bet if Tua would have just played normally they would have gotten a touchdown and won the game.  
Kickers on suicide watch
georgia pls
I can't believe we are here right now. Finish it out Dawgs! (obviously just picking sides for the big game)
HERE.WE.GO.
First NCG OT ever?**EDIT**: Wrong. 2002 season, Ohio State over Miami in 2OT
I just threw up
UCF DA REAL CHAMPION NOW
Like missing a layup wide open. I feel bad and I don't even like Bama. 
I work in five hours fucking kill me 
Same here man. I'm tired AF
That kid had to stand on the sideline for WAY too long all while knowing he was about to have to make the kick of his life.
F
I'm sitting here eating Southern Barbecue style lays watching tow southern teams play for the college football national championship. Y'all still wanna tell me the North won the war?^^^I'm ^^^kidding ^^^no ^^^flamerino
If they wouldn't have centered the ball with that last play they would've been fine
Holy shit I thought it was over!
Hope you've got your backup alcohol, folks
THIS IS WHY YOU DON'T PLAY FOR A FG AT BAMA. 
The last play of regulation. https://youtu.be/Jdv2Wp9MzY0
Whos ready to watch Bo run in for a TD on a play where no less than 6 Alabama players blatantly hold following a gifted first down on a bullshit PI call?
Kicker sent the ball to the shadow realm, like holy shit my dude
I member my last OT thread...
YOU CAN'T MAKE THOSE TYPES OF THREATS AGAINST A MEMBER OF CONGRESS!
GUYS! THEY FOUND COURTNEY ROLAND!
I genuinely feel bad for that kicker for what he's about to go through 
I’ve got work in the morning! Can’t someone have won already. 
This ref has a radio voice
Is... Is my arm supposed to be tingling and numb? 
That's just CFB. 
Well, 2 out of 3 games have been good
Oh we already got a champion
Please finish this I want to go to bed 
Pappanastos is going to get so many death threats if Bama loses....
I wanted to go to bed an hour ago but here we are
My cat will never forgive me for the shouting that sent it to the depths of the underside of my bed after the scream I let out when the kick was missed. Totally worth it.
That ref pumped me up 
When Georgia Tech played Tennessee at the start of the season (also in Mercedes-Benz Stadium), our kicker missed the potential game winning FG from 36 yards at the end of the 4th quarter.
That dude must have a Blair Walsh poster in his room 
I’m sure they’ll wipe their tears with 5* running backs
Shut it down boys.Game ends in a tie and resumes later so we can fucking sleep.
700 comments in one minute WHAT THE FUCK
Nick Saban is going to go pull some freshman out of the band and have him kick in OT.
"We still don't have a champion"UCF be like....
I really hate Saban 
Fuck 
Alabama skimming on kicking recruits
OVERTIME THREAD WHOOO
Where were you when kicker was kill?
Alabama beginning of Season: We don’t need a kicker. We’ll just score touchdowns.Alabama now: Fuck
Playing these games on a weekday is so fucking stupid. 
Refs are biased for letting Bama call the coin flip
1000 fucking comments and the thread was just posted. JFC Reddit.
PapaNasty bout to change his last name to Smith tomorrow morning.
papanachos knew we wanted OT
SOMEONE HOLD ME 
Tails never fails!!Edit: called it
http://i.imgur.com/RvrbPrS.gifv
I hope they don’t send that kid death threats. That’s brutal. 
We're about to experience a singularity everyone! Hold on to your butts!
Poor kid will likely get murdered if Bama loses. 
The world keeps spinning round and round 
Fake news ref, I was told UCF is already the decided champion.
My soul hurts a little bit for that dude.
Yeeesssss https://s3media.247sports.com/Uploads/Boards/156/25156/237219.jpg
feels like a lot of people are calling out of work tomorrow
***IT'S GAME 7 OT IN THE STANLEY CUP FINAL BOYS!!!!!!!!!***
FIRST!DILLY DILLY! 
First kick six now this. What's with Bama and kicking? If they lose tonight because of that, he will get worse treatment than that Michigan punter from puntghazi in 2015.
This guy predicts
I wouldn't want to
pls no
GLASSES > YOUR KICKER
There's no way you shack off a FG that would have won the National Title.
**[–]jesusonadinosaur 3 points 9 minutes ago**  *at least bama sucks at kicking sometimes*You're welcome Georgia. Now go win this
ROLL TIDE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! LOL 
GEORGIA PLSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
I can't believe they can't get a better kicker 
I could have made that kick
That kids gonna get a death threat or two 
Awkward as fuck ref banter
How cool would it be if they played a recap of the game, instead of commercials there 
please tua please defense 
Bit small innit? 
they were favored by ESPN's FPI and Vegas
For his own safety, Pappanastos may need to change his identity and move to a different state if Bama loses tonight. Man, tough break for the kid.
Let's fucking goooo
Hey #48 isn't in the coin toss??
The suspense!
If Georgia wins the toss, should they play defense first?
Who do you think Saban picks for his ritual sacrifices?
Might?
This game started yesterday. 
~~no~~ OT tonight!
I've never gotten used to college OT rules
witty ref ohhhhh
Anyone who sends our kicker death threats can catch these hands
I was totally convicted Alabama was gonna sneak out the cheap win there. Wew 
I have never been more convinced that UCF is the champion.
If we go to 2OT do we get a new thread?
Jokes
Win or lose, Papanastos is probably getting death threats from some scumbag.
>Less than a minute ago>538 comments
Refs got jokes
Shitttt
I don't think they're in the mood for jokes, ref
this ref is the definition of cringe"hey youngins let's do some overtime yeah? sound lit? gucci."
I'm tripping balls right now so I'm having trouble comprehending that this game is happening how it is.
Never end, college football. August is so far away.
We’ve past the peak of Alabama’s dominance. They’ll win more championships, but we’re passed 2011-2012 levels.
I mean, who didn’t see this coming? Alabama and Field Goals, name a more iconic duo. 
OT THREADDDDDD
We've had OT since 1998.  They don't need to explain the rules of OT anymore.
Why can’t we ever have a decent one 
Damn must suck to watch sports in the East coast 
OT thread has zero comments. Open thread to 150 comments.
Don't lose now for fuck sake 
Where my homies at? We made it!!!
I drink a lot. Is this the first OT since BCS era?
I hate this ref so much.
I have to work tomorrow 
I WATCHED THIS EXPECTING TO WANT TO DRINK BLEACH, AM HIGHLY ENTERTAINED INSTEAD. 
National championship parade
We still don't have a championUCF triggered
Ref: "We still don't have a champion."UCF: "...excuse me?"
Papa nasty is one poor bastard tonight. But hey, I love him, at least.
Wooooo in before the first 900 comments, suck it nerds.
Now we just need to see a missed FG turn into a TD run. 
Wow, we made it, guys. Instant classic.
WIDE LEFT 1 
I WAS ALIVE FOR THIS THREAD 
Pappanastos is a covert agent confirmed.
When can I get off this train
Submitted: Just now.598 commentsDamn
"we still don't have a champion" Yea no shit why we playing overtime 
I really hope no one kills that kicker
It's been an honor shitposting with you Georgiabros. GO DAWGS!!
History is being made.  Wow.
This is what I'm most excited for. The savagery from the mods.
Please tell me you recorded them during the kick 
You could see the anxiety all over that kicker’s face as he was warming up. Just brutal to watch. 
RIP Papa Nasty: Cause of Death: Lynched the moment he gets back to Tuscaloosa.
Yo this ref got a good ass radio voice
PAPPA-NAH-STOS
I pray for that kicker Bama wins this game. His life is going to turn into a shitstorm for a while if they lose. 
So when is UCF storming the field? 
Shanked it
Man he might have made that kick from the right hash. 
OVERTIME AHHHHHHH
How is this possible 
Holy shit #75 for Bama is a giant fucking man.
There's a good chance he'll be asked to die 
He played for Georgia
Both sides of the coin say Alabama. 
Feel for that kid...but go Georgia. How has Saban not learned his lesson and recruit good kickers. 
saban said if youi miss this im sending 48 to your dorm later.scared the piss outta him
Those rules have been around for a while, and they are pretty easy to follow.  Why do I need to see them every time there's an overtime
REFS ARE BIAST GIVING BAMA THE COINFLIP BOTH TIMES
That was a Pappanasty FG attempt.
Alabama and Georgia could not determine a champion in regulation, therefore UCF is crowned CFP National Champion!
you legit had to kick a 5 yard chip shot 
DOWN WITH BAMA
OT
in
Good god shut up ref
I kinda want Bama to win so that kicker survives the mob violence. Part joking, but seriously.
SABAN needs to sleep over at some kickers houses
Easy game for UCF 
PLEASE GEORGIA NOT TWICE IN ONE YEAR
Why do Alabama kickers always miss?
I didn't think OT would happen. Glad I was wrong. Come on, Georgia!
B L A N K E N S H I P
so if Bama scores, who is going for 2 with Tua?
Coin Toss Part 2!
But we have a champion it’s UCF!!!
This game has taken months off my life
He is choosing a book for reading
Never trust a Greek bearing kicks.
END THIS GAME! WE HAVE CLASS TOMORROW 
Bet the Ohio State kicker would’ve made that.
Apparently four quarters of madness.
If Georgia wins the Alabama kicker is getting death threats.
that ref lol
Hurt comes back in right at the end, Bama fucks up.Alright, fess up: which one of you has the voodoo doll?
Welcome to the 7th thread of this game
Georgia...don't blow this. 49 states are counting on you to end this bullshit.
From 90% Alabama chance of win to now back to a 50/50 game! 
That ref's got dad jokes
Kickers are about 35% of the reason I prefer the NFL over college ball. 
And the one in he 1Q. Sorta feel bad for that kid
Less than a minute old and over 500 comments
Cue grown ass Alabamians sending death threats to a kid playing a game for free.
Idk what Bama is so worried about with all their TRUUUEE FRESHMAN
Shankopotamus, the Third
That ref smooth af 
Fuck I'm hardman...junior
**WHY NO FRESHMAN KICKER?**
I just love when Bama special teams shits the bed. 
Ref loves explaining this coin more than I love anything 
GIVE ME SEVEN OVERTIMES
Finally! I thought people were going to actually have enough time to read my comments. Whew 
"it is a tail" LMAO
aight georgia time to turn this chubb into a full on woody 
Really, we won't end the national championship game in a draw. Thank you, Ref.
Bruhhh Pappanastos mannnn
Pappanastu: "It was the wind"
Lmao Bama should've sent #48 out for the coin toss
Ref going for style points I see.
Mmmmm.  The Masters.  See you all there?
This ref is a fucking goober. 
Won't be anything compared to the human sacrifice Saban is going to conduct in the locker room after this game is over. 
Over 700 now lol
can we all give a real shoutout to UGA and Bama for keeping the CFB season going as long as possible?
Lmao ref was hoping someone would laugh when he said that
I can’t even right now 
Of course we have a champion how dare you disrespect UCF!!!!
Tails coming in clutch again. 
This ref seriously think these players stupid as hell and I love it
Off-Topic Breaking News: UW's mascot, Dubs, is retiring  after next season :(
No tropical kicky boi is walking through that door, Bama.

We should see if Tua can kick 
Fucking rigged coins
THE REDDIT LIVE FEATURE IS LIT HAHA NOBODY WILL EVEN SEE THIS BUT UPVOTE IF YOU DID
Hey I punch players and attack my coaches to warm up for the next series -- Bama personnel

GA pls! Let's get a champion!
This is great
That's what I thoughtLol
Offseason posts will have to wait a bit longer
Papa John's with the big missed FG
Seriously. Imagine the bus ride back to the hotel if they lose 
Kid's kick swung harder than 48's punch.
If Alabama loses, he's killing himself tonight.
CHECK THE REPLAY LARRY
One of Nick Saban's true freshmen will give this game away with a turnover. But that won't stop Kirby from heaping ejaculatory praise.
some dude just called me a Mountainqueer LMAO 
WES BYRUM DIDN'T MISS NO GODDAMN TOSTITO WINNING KICK WAR DANG EAGLE PAWL
BAH GAWD THAT'S UCF'S MUSIC!
I did

Anyone ever seen that kid and Blair Walsh in the same room?

Both roommates just went to bed, never been more disappointed in my life
Damn the ref taking shots at UCF
Kicked it around the Georgia defender. Also kicked it around the FG post, but still
Wow I never would have dreamed he missed that...come on GA not bama again.
Welcome to the SEC after 11:00. 
WHAT. A. GAME. 
Ref was making calls all day pushing for OT just to make that cheesy line.
We haven’t won a coin toss since the 70’s
Fuck having a job right?
RIP to all East coasters who just wanted to sleep
STILL DONT HAVE A CHAMPION?? HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF UCF
That guy needs to transfer to Georgia, he's going to be a legend there if they win, because he blew that field goal.
This game will be won by a TD
leading questions!
Tails OP 
COLLEGE KICKERS
Tails never fails !
Mercedes Bones
“We still don’t have a champion. We’re going to keep playing until we get one.”Thanks ref for summing it up
That kicker is on death row in the state of Alabama 
Y'all know the Taco Bell illuminati has the game fixed to make sure it goes to overtime to show more ads right?
I love this ref getting cute with it
I want to die.
They fucking rigged the coin flip.
That poor kicker is going to have to move to Africa or something. Wherever he goes on the globe he's going to get "aren't you that guy....?"
Gerogia wins in OT with the momentum
shut up ref
I legit feel bad for the kicker. I can't even imagine the stress, literally kicking to win the natty. Bama fans better not go nuts on him, but i'm sure they will if they lose 
This ref is hamming it up
Please Please Please Please Please
CFP has the best overtime rules
NEVER TRUST college kicker.
I feel bad for Bamas kicker. Knowing them he's legit going to be getting death threats for awhile if he cant redeem himself. It'll be worse than that boise state kicker
I hate overtime
HERE WE GO!!!!!!!!!!
He bout to be lynched when he’s next seen in Bama
Much as I hate Bama I pity that kicker

i'm going to feel so bad for Paps if 'bama loses...
its a tail!!!
This is a spunky ref
**That's what I thought**
ONE MORE SONG! ONE MORE SONG! ONE MORE SONG!
The moment I saw that other player go up and have a talk with the kicker I knew he would miss it. Let the led do his thing. 
what are we 0-4 on playoff coin tosses now? 
I feel like I just saw the worst moments of someone’s life omg, feel bad for the kid
thats what i thought
Time for Fromm to show out 
Oklahoma also won the coin toss...
Mine is still in the 2nd quarter. Should we tell him UGA blew it?
Cocky ref is cocky 
Ref is loving it hahaha
Sweet sweet baby CFB Jesus 
that’s what i thought

It is a tail.
I'm stuck watching skycam stream. Can't hear commentators cause normal stream is straight shit even with 100 down. It's neat and weird at the same time.

All I wanted was for both teams to lose, and this is about as close as I could hope for
Bama wins the toss RIGGED
Yep. You don't interrupt their concentration and make them lose focus.
Alabama, I’m available to kick 
"That's what I thought."
What a nice guy.
Georgia: "Here Bama, take this nice, shiny national championship trophy"Bama: "Nah"
They should have stayed on the right hash.
Overtime again come on

Alabama kickers and fucking sucking. Name a more iconic duo
I'm quite certain that he will probably get death threats from crazed fans.
"We still don't have a champion and we will keep playing until we get one." Classic line.
This ref lol
Lol at Sabans "fuuuck me" Someone gif that

Second BCS/CFP game to go to overtime  
CFP Championship game to the pit of misery!
Watch espn is such a fucking piece of shit. Fuck this company. Freezes every 15 seconds. Every singlenimportant play of this game has been missed bc it freezes. It froze before the kick and picks up after it was missed.I hope this stupid fucking company goes out of business with their shitty service and programs. 
Bama won 2 coin tosses this game?? Shit is rigged as fuck. 
OMG WE HAVEN'T WON A COIN TOSS IN PLAYOFFS. 
Over/Under on death threats Pappanastos receives from Bama fans if the Tide lose this: 138.5

That kick was definitely good....if they had kept the ball on the right hash.E: on
"We still don't have a champion"UCF Boiz
Weighted coin
"We still don't have a championship. We are going to keep playing until we get one." -RefThe ref continued..."Don't make me turn this national championship game around."
What a sassy ref
I’m running out of bourbon. Let’s get this done, Dawgs.
Alabama kicker was found hanging from atop the Mercedes Benz dome. 
[deleted]
Anyone in or around the University of Alabama. You need to defend that kicker if at all possible.He is probably going to get death threats and all kinds of shit from this. He's just a college kid. Please do something proactive.
“That’s what I thought you big pansy”
RIGGED
I couldn't imagine being an actual fan of either team. This is nerve wracking. 
Here’s to a truly great ending to the CFB Season. No matter which team wins, I think we can all agree that the fans won this week! 
Ref trying to be funny. He looked at both of them to see if they gonna laugh at his dumb ass quip 
CHAOS 
Baw Gawd! That's UCF's music!
No one cares what you thought ref
#OT
we out here
Be glad this isn't USC, else ESPN would be telling us how the Darnold caused that miss.
Doubled!
>~~Bama~~ still has all the momentum... moving the ball at willi GOT YOU
“That’s what I thought” he’d be a cool ref if he saw Bama penalties 
Wtf he mean "play till we get a champion"UCF already had their parade, bro
This ref is so fucking cringy
I just wanna say it's been an honor sharing this season with you all. And my sports pants are very hard with anticipation of the offseason shitposts. 2018 will be the best offseason yet. 
Georgia sports never wins the big coin tosses 
Hold on to your hats because it's one of my patented hot takes!I think either Bama or Georgia will win this game. The winner will celebrate. You heard it here first!!
That ref is a ham
this ref is fun I like him as a person but his calls are shit
the kicker is gonna receive death threats isn't he
Y’all wanted a game? here it is. Can’t say you are bored of SEC NC after dark 
I don’t want Alabama to win, but I also want their kicker to redeem himself cuz I feel really bad for him
Who the fuck says "It is a tail"?
THATS WHAT I THOUGHT 
Worst part about this. 
YEAH!
The fuck is with this ref?
>you want defense firstwell maybe not you dick lol
What the fuck?That ref just told Alabama they wanted to go on defense first, haha.
UCF 2017 NATIONAL CHAMPS!
“You wanna go on defense first” THE RIG IS IN
FREE FOOTBALL BUT IM OUT OF BEER
I thought I was done drinking for the night, but time to crack open another beer.
I'm gonna hate life at work tomorrow.
Jesus christ I think ima have a heart attack. Also I was here
Saban's fault for not recruiting a kicker
That's what I thought
LETS GET FREEEAAAKKKYYYY
Can someone clue me in on the lifetime season ticket holder kicker joke?
He can't make calls, he can't make jokes...what thr fuck can he do?
Quick! Say we’ll win!
You right
Of course the ref knew what bama wanted to do /s
"That's what I thought."
I would still like to know how you can punch someone and still play, but refuse a refs help and get ejected.Oh wait Snell wasn’t in a bama jersey that’s why
This ref is just...ugh. smug and condescending. 
if bama loses that kicker will neeed to be on suicide watch or need to protected from fans
Fuck bama. This game shouldn't even be tied. Last TD happened on an uncalled flase start. 
It just means more, guys.
>Mercedes ball
FINKLE IS EINHORN!!!
That kid was about to get laid so hard....yikes 
Fuck bama
Ditto.
I’m not watching because I hate both of these teams with every fiber of my being. But if I had to pick, I would choose Alabama to be runner up after national champs UCF.
I wish I could enjoy this game. 
This game is fucking incredible 
8 overtimes please
“That’s what I thought”RIGGED /s
True alabama kicker right there
You just got Boise'd
That kick was ass.
National championship of choking
I blame the guy who was praying behind him. Clearly didn’t do a good enough job chatting up the big guy. 
Will you be mine?
They’re just too wonderful compared to the nfl you mean? 
COLLEGE FOOTBALL WILL NOT GO QUIETLY INTO THAT GOOD NIGHT
First we got overtime in the Rose Bowl, now overtime in the championship. This has been a great playoff series
DON'T BLOW THIS GEORGIA. GOD WANTS YOU TO WIN. 
Don't get too chummy, ref. We might not be going into OT if not for that one drive
Dawgs pls.
#FREE FOOBAWW
Chubb breaks a td in OT
Naturally Bama wins both coin tosses this game.
Why does this ref keep telling the captain's what to say? 
Yeah I thought so too
Nice rubberized turf 
The ref thinking he's a genius and what not 
Ref gotta make sure Bama picks the good one
Teams should be starting at the 50 instead of the 25 for OT imo.
College football OT >>>
exile or death. no alternative 
"Do you want to go on defense first?""That's what I thought."#???
I liked that ref, that was fun 
"do you want to go on defense? That's a good call" lol what the fuck was that ref
no one calls tails  that coin is rigged  /s
Referee interference 
[deleted]
Hot take: He misses another kick and goes in the Georgia HOF
Also did you see his coach right next to the kicking stand right before he ran out? He couldn't watch and was covering his eyes. That's the last coach the kicker saw, too afraid to watch
Alright ref take it easy dude 
CHAOS
Cade Foster is getting flashbacks...
im so fucking glad i have no emotional stakes in this gamesome people are about to be fucking heartbroken
DON'T LET THEM GET AWAY WITH THIS GEORGIA!
Bama has all the luck for the little things man.
go for the throat Georgia
It is in fact a. T A I L
We're 0-4 in bowl game coin tosses
Referee suggesting Alabama goes on defense first. Helping out Bama. 
Overtime. Out of booze for my heart condition. 
Bama misses another important FG feeding a bunch of drunk assholes schadenfreude? [Shitposting time] (https://media.giphy.com/media/kRgj0fQLxhVoA/giphy-downsized-large.gif)
Jokes on the ref...UCF already crowned itself champion
How will the refs screw Georgia in OT?
so much better than NFL
Nah he’s.... *backs away from keyboard*
"you wanna go on defense first? that's what I thought." lmao yo this ref man 
Ref handling his business and loving it 
I HAVE A BASKETBALL GAME TOMORROW LET ME GET SOME FUCKING SLEEP, SOMEONE WIN
Refs completely killed Georgia's momentum on that false start and facemask blow calls. That's a 14 point difference that's on them. Other than that they've been solid but those two calls are game-altering.
Ref with a little improv. 
The other team should be able to heads or tails since Alabama did in beginning of game 
Give the ball to Sony Michel
@TimBrando: Alabama wins HEY I picked them too! Y’all love me there now right?? Hohum CFB’s National Invitational is at long last over. No! OH my it will take 23 and with OT my friends at ESPN get the HUGE rating. The CFB Gods bail out the Committee. Shocked.
SIDELINE PENALTY ON UGA INCOMING
About time he started thinking 
We can't afford multiple tails anymore
lol did the ref just make bama's decision for them?
I HAVE WORK IN 6 HOURS!!!!!!!!
The Ref is just excited to talk to a real Alabama player
That ref suave AF lol
Ted Valentine, is that you doing the coin toss?!?!
Looks like everybody was ready to go home and has to mentally restart
Which would you prefer: Hurts to FAU or Ohio State?
holy shit
LET’S FUCKING DO THIS 
Tails never fails!
Hey, ESPN. Don't give a shit about your coverage. Just get on with it. 
How does Alabama have a kicker that bad? I dont get it.
Georgia are still going to lose unless their play calling gets much better than it was in the second half.  They are telling Alabama if they are running or passing and still expecting to move the ball.
So sayth we all
Why? its pretty straightforward
They didn't need OT to beat Auburn
Hi I see you :)
He's shitty, but damn not that serious
Wouldn't be surprised, it's a state tradition 
This is a friendly reminder to be thankful we don't have the NFL's bullshit system of overtime.
"We're gonna keep playing until Bama wins"
Just commenting to help crash Reddit
"We still don't have a champion yet"*Glares at Pappanastos*"But I guess we'll keep playing until SOMEBODY kicks a field goal"
Why didn’t Bama take a couple shots at a touchdown, I trust my ex more than I trust college kickers 
That’s what I THOUGHT!
That ref was really hamming it up
LOL COCKY ASS REF. "THATS WHAT I THOUGHT"
Ref hamming it up.
Yeah baby! OT!!!!!!!!!!!!!Fuck off sleep. Fuck off work. Let's do this.
Wtf ref? 
Remember how bad that coin toss was for the OSU-USC game was?Wait, was it the OU-GA game? I forget.
the battle for second place
The ref is so cute #grandpa
Tails twice. The coin is weighted. 
1,000 comments in under two minutes.... 
I don't think the ref should be influencing decisions like that
That's what you get for having a 37 year old kicker, Alabama.
Please Georgia 
Heheheheheh, I love college OT.
All part of Satan’s plan... have faith my children
We haven’t gotten a coin flip once in the playoffs 
And he missed it so hard 
I would never watch a bama game with a bama fan, I want them to lose too badly 
I heard Someone pushed him?
Man I feel bad for that kicker if Bama loses. Fans are crazy and do stupid things
I know many of you are eager for the sweet release of death but I personally am having a lot of fun, college football isn’t over yet fam
I love this ref
And papanasty says YES to OT
refs rigged the toss Kappa
This ref is sassy
where are all those guys who were saying how boring this game is?
Holy shit already 1000 comments here
Sorry guys, I didn't have my bama polo on, but I've fixed it. 
pick 6
Hey everyone 
I know... He can be Chris blewitt
Only fair solution is to crown UCF as national champions
SHOULD HAVE PUT A TRUE FRESHMAN KICKER OUT THERE
This is the best worst game of all time
This thread is moving so fast nobody will notice I didnt finish my broccoli like a good boy
I’m gonna smoke so much weed for this 
I didn't want to be here.
Go Bama
Tails never fails baby. By the way... touchdowns only pls 
Bc they doodoo
They do it in the NFL too
Ref: "We still don't have a champion"UCF: "eye-blinking gif"
The ref is a terrible ref, but at least he doesn’t sound like a bumbling idiot during the toss. So he’s got that going for him. 
Pappadastos looks like Papa John’s illegitimate child 
That ref is fucking funny
Gram Gano came to kick for Bama, lmao
"That's what I thought" what a cuc
That ref was milking the spotlight right there. 
Ref must've never heard of UCF
PREDICTION:GEORGIA WINS OFF A PICK 6 IN 2ND OT WHEN BAMA GOES FOR A TD INSTEAD OF A FG. DONT @ME.
I can’t get over the two shanked field goals
Maybe comments like this help to perpetuate the idea that making death threats as jokes to college athletes is okay. 
he's already getting them anyways
I feel exactly the same way
Yeah I'd be okay with that 
980 comments in 1 minute lol
What a shock, the ref is being overly chummy with the Bama players.
“That’s what I thought”
Bama fans ain't laughing at kicker sleepovers now are you!!!!
Ref bias confirmed lolI am ashamed.
That may have been part of his plan. 
Toast
/r/empiredidnothing
I want to go to bed 
"that's what I thought, bitch"
as a kicker who missed a lot, that poor kid. There's no worse feeling.
They should of sent the guy who punched people to the coin toss
C'mon Georgia don't fuck this up again
If Bama wins this, Disney needs to make Tau the next Moana movie 
Ref tryna make jokes
If Georgia wins, that poor kicker’s gonna get some serious death threats
That was the most bad ass line out off any official ever
Pappanastos just prevented this entire sub from imploding.
LOL, that's what I thought!
I'm genuinely surprised Saban didn't let 48 walk out for the coin toss.
OT OT, there's never much love when you go OT, I pray to make it back in one piece, I pray I pray
Bama player moved in front of the camera so we couldn't see the coin.  The fix is in y'all
And he may have to go back out there. What a nightmare. 
Wewlad, damn
Please football gods
#shit
I am fearful for that kid's life if Bama loses this game
"This shouldn't have even gone to overtime." - both teams
Give UCF the title already!!!
Can Saban pull his starting kicker too? This poor kid's nerves and confidence must be shredded to bits. 
Wonder if they keep Tua in. He might get trigger happy and throw a pick. 
I blame the guy talking to him. Shoulda let him be by himself tbh.
4 fucking lost coin tosses 
I’m dying 
but muh UCF
[The ringer with an absolutely evergreen tweet...](https://twitter.com/ringer/status/948031917626142721) 
Smug little reffy
lol goodbye to my work performance tomorrow
WHERE THU 5TH QTR THREAD BE AT.
Come on Fromm...
What the fuck was that? Ref is fuckin buddies with them
poor kid.
Hey
Best Monday of 2018 already. Don't @ me
Please don't let us down Georgia...
Refs even helping Bama pick which side to play first lol
Condescending Big 10 Ref.
2-0 on coin tosses. Rigged confirmed
Thank god. At least we get to go second
He’s a hero in my book 
That guy narrating the Masters commercial sounds so fucking waspy, at the end it's like he says "at the MEEAsters"
This is as good as a second place game gets 
DO WE FOLLOW /R/HOCKEY PLAYOFF OVER TIME RULES IN AN CFB PLAYOFF OVERTIME THREAD? ALL CAPS FOR SINGLE OT
Good Lord Bama. Idk why you don't go out and just pick the best kicker and bring him to Tuscaloosa. 
I hate you, but I agree with you.
Here's the advice.  Score a touchdown and put up the point.  We know a thing about overtime up here.  It's the only play.
Oh good, we get to hear more about how Georgia beat us last week in the OG OT! 
damn imagine being that bama kicker if they lose, wont even want to go to class
If you're going to bed bc you work tomorrow then fuck you
Big Ten refs always love the spotlight. 
He probably got thousands already 
LOL. What did he ask Bama before hand?
"How do you do, fellow kids?"   -This ref
Just tuned in to see the missed kick. But more importantly, what the hell is with this broadcast?
I hope daddy pappa misses more kicks
Shut up ref
If this goes two overtimes I'm burning it all down. 
"yeah I thought so my good friend"
Better than a 6:00am meeting in the evening, that'd be weird.
Oh fuck I forgot this is COLLEGE OVERTIME. This shit gon’ be good.
It is a tail
They couldn't decide it in regulation, which further cements UCF's spot as National Champion
Jesus Christ 
did the ref just say "thats what i thought"???
LOOKS LIKE OT IS BACK ON THE MENU BOYS
B1G refs are pretty neat
Haha, ref helping him out with the decision.
[OVERTIME?!?!?!](https://youtu.be/WPji2x_QxbY)
RIP east coast working class
Why does he have to say  “it’s a tail” why not “it’s tails” 
Please get this done Dawgs
“We still don’t have a champion” Yes we do it’s UCF
I've gotta be at work in 8 hours... fuck me.
So how does the NFL even find kickers?
well hello there 
That's what I thought! 
Thanks for the interlude, dork. 
“Do you want to go on defense first???” Don’t help them, let the pressure get to him and mess him up 
This is wild, I should watch more college football.
No.  OT tonight.
Hats what i thought...
If UGA can play all these overtimes, maybe we can afford another round of the playoffs... 
Losing the coin toss in OT for second week in a row........
Anybody got a stream? All the threads are removed over in cfbstreams and I wanna catch overtime!
First OT national title game ever. Perfect ending 
He is going to get them anyway. 
They have enough nattys anyway 
Mine don't even watch football, so consider yourself ahead.
SEC AFTER DARK
Im just glad we get OT
Last time there was OT in a championship game, Ohio State won :) 
#OVERTIME!!!
That ref is having the best time ever.
DAWGS NEED A TD
That's called incentive 
I don't have a problem with it. 
UCF are already champs
B1G B1G
"That's what I thought"
"Congratulations to both teams, we're going to keep playing until we get one."Most Midwestern ref of all time.
I'd be dead if I were an UGA fan
UGA has lost every coin toss this postseason
First the falcons with the lead in the superbowl and the  blowing it in ot. And now here we are in ot in the national championship.... please god. I can't take another heartbreak 
Well that's another kicker we've scarred for life.
Does anyone have a link to the stream of the championship parade?
That refs a sassy boi
i feel sorry for pappanachos
"We still don't have a champion" -- Does the ref not know about UCF?
Head ref is suave af 
Go dawgs! 
My television signal keeps stuttering and it’s making me so mad
Bama kicker must thought the whole "tying is like kissing your sister" thing literally and gotten excited.
[deleted]
That kick just broke the Georgia sports curse. Braves 2018 world series champions!
"That's what I thought."
Reddit’s live feature instead of new on mobile is impossible for these game threads! 
You did it against us Dawgs. Do it here. Kill the dynasty.
Fuck me up please
Ref confirmed a bama shill
Big 10 refs suck
BAMA KICKER TO THE PIT OF MISERY, DILLY DILLY!
lmao this ref has too much flair
except little field goals
That would be the first lunching in Alabama in what, 5 days? 
lol I love this ref in how he goes into so much detail about the coin toss
This shit has 1200 comments in a minute lol
Didn't send #48 out for the coin flip bama?
If this game doesn't end before 1AM Eastern, we will need to bring out some Pac-12 teams to finish the game.
OTTTTTTTTT
Glad to get another hit of CFB before the long dark offseason
I really do love this “Homers” megacast.
LOL
So Calvin Ridley is switching teams again or nah?
Fuck it, I don't even care if we lose. UGA winning for the first time since 1980 in this fashion would be glorious. Good luck boys.
Nobody laughed at that loser's joke
Bama players look straight up defeated.
Even if Bama wins he’ll get death threats. If they lose he’ll get lynched the moment he reenters the state.
I'm gonna vomit man
We have seen 3 Alabama players lose their scholarships in one game
UCF would've won that coin toss.
1000 comments in a minute this is my first NCG post. No matter what happens; it's my fault.
RNG is broken.
Refs couldn't be more obvious 
I hear Blair Walsh is still eligible....
He practiced that line in the mirror his whole life. 
Luckily 87 wasn't out there he would have dropped him
Gonna create more profiles so I can up vote this more. 
This fuckin ref is having the time of his life.  Badass coin toss bahaha
Auburn, can you lend us Carlson for 30 minutes.  Do it for the state of Alabama, please...
Georgia and postseason overtime go together like pizza and pineapple. Perfectly. 
Rodrigo Blankenship about to become a national hero
Steve Bartman got nothing on him.
No you don't
When you miss two field goals 
It was the pumped in wind
Do either of these teams really deserve to play UCF for the championship?
OBJECTION- Leading the witness, your honor
Would've been better if Ref should've said "yeah that's what I thought bitch"
I love me some shitty bama kickers
Loaded coin Loaded game 
Referee: *[drops a hammer on the ground]*
TAILS NEVER FAILS
Auburn wish of both teams choking came true! It's a national championship miracle!
Refresh me on college OT rules reddit fam- both teams get an opportunity to possess the ball, no?
Hello, OT thread.
I never thought this thread would exist
Almost want Bama to win now because I don't want to witness this kid get killed.
We're gonna play til we get one.Thanks dipshit. Glad you decided to let us play.
Not fair that Kevin Butler coached the Georgia kickers.
A miracle my God you Dawgs, a miracle in Mercedes-Benz! Dawgnation was praying, pleading and we got our shot you Dawgs! Play your hearts out you Dawgs, here is your chance!
Damn it Georgia do it for everyone come on.
Who knew Sabans retirement was actually going to prison for murder.
Ref is a total jabroni. B1Gs finest
May the power of the state of Georgia and short comings come together and slay the Alabama dragon
Papadoupalas come to #theFau (for your own personal safety)
Laces out!
Just call both teams champs to piss of Auburn
This is an instant classic. I dont even care who wins i love it baby.
Please Georgia
OH DAMN
Kick the tires & light the fires big daddy
they don't like football?
I like that
So, what happened with Britney?
That's an okay time to steal the show as a ref @Teddy Valentine
Ref was hamming it up
Alabama is gonna fumble it their first snap. Mark my words
CAN GEORGIA STOP THE CURSE AND KEEP ALABAMA FROM REACHING SUPER SABAN 5? FIND OUT RIGHT NOW, ON *KICKER BALL Z*. 
Tails never fails I guess
Mercedes Ball Stadium
Ref saying "we still don't have a champion" clearly didn't watch the Peach Bowl. 
If Bama don't win this game the kicker for Bama will become the next bill buckner, steve bartman type.
That implies the drinking didn't get them years ago
What are those glasses really hiding?!
I'll forever be salty about this when/if Bama ends up winning.
Could have won the game twice. He shit his bunk bed
now overtime will be Alabama and Georgia combined against UCF and the Browns combined.Who wins?
These garbage refs need to start the OT and stop all the jabbering. The only reason this game is in OT is because you zebra clowns couldn't do your job right.
Who’s else’s dick is hard right now?
Hes reffing wasnt that bad was it?
And ours had Mickey Mouse so it's the best
so did the Browns
That finally became illegal there
Masters commercials playing like ESPN trying to remind Georgia fans that there’s still a life after this game
The ref asking leading questions. OBJECTION YOUR HONOR!
"That's what I thought" 
Incoming Turntle 2.0
that kick... classic 'Bama.   It's a freakin' curse
THIS IS IT. THE WHOLE SEASON COMES DOWN TO THIS WOW
Good lord that's heartbreaking for BAMA.
FBI is already enrolling him in witness protection as we speak
Hey I like the little bit of flair and looseness the guy has. 
Because nobody's gonna watch this game
Wow
I feel like we don't really have a leg to stand on with kickers
hug me brother!
That's one confident ass ref
I think Alabama's kicker was distracted by UCF's music in the background. BAH GAWD HE MISSED IT
How to take another two years off of Georgia fans’ lives
This is the "both teams losing" finish i was hoping for
Seriously tho. Bobby got Janikowski after our wide lefts and rights. Why can't Saban find one?
F em both
NO put some voodoo shit on your state man...
Oy, real talk. He can live in Central Florida I’m sure
All the 5* guys and Saban always has a shitty kicker...wtf?
WE HAVE THE SAME COIN
So, today is now tomorrow. 
That ref is so casual lol 
[MRW rn](https://media.giphy.com/media/3o6fIUOohyg4yegu1G/giphy.gif)
The ref loves this shit 
How about you think about calling holds instead of what they will pick
Allstate bribed the kicker
A/C is skrong 
Thought the same thing. 34 is the laces on that one
But is it better than #Pac12AfterDark???
Did the ref just tell Bama the choice to make?
Regardless of what happens tonight the Chaos Gods have blessed us with OT in the last game of the year. Praise be to Chaos.
That missed field goal brought back bad memories as a 90's kid Chiefs fans
They need to do the scrums like in the old XFL instead of cointosses
Can Scott just do the drop kick thing Flutie did for an FG instead of Papadakaos missing another one?  
OT means more "True Freshman"s
Papa bless
I wanted a decent nights rest but this is better.
[Cutest choke] (https://i.imgur.com/depFH.jpg)
UCF is the champion of our hearts 
Seems alright to me
If his sister also lives there then yeah. 
Games like these make me happy to live on the west coast lol
UNBELIEVABLE!
Ref thinks he is auditioning for an acting job 
Just give it to Alabama so that poor kicker lives
TAILS STILL NEVER FAILS
WE GET FREE FOOTBALL BOYS AND GIRLS
We reached maximum anus pucker
"Referee seems to be enjoying the spotlight"- after listening to you say "True Freshmen" like someone dared you to use it once per sentence, I enjoy a ref with lighthearted humor.
I was pretty neutral in the beginning but after Saban put in #48 I don't want to see him get another trophy. The guy attacked your own staff dude.
"Heh, nothing personnel UGA" - ref
The only things getting slammed more than the Alabama kickers are the livers in Alabama and Georgia 
hold on to your butts
That’s what I thought
[deleted]
Deals bein made.
Lmao
I've made too many tech jokes to be a co-champion
How 'bout them dawgs
Bama fans eerily quiet in these threads so far 
TAILS IS FUCKING WEIGHTED REEE CONSPIRACY
It is a tail
Rose Bowl 2.0!
Edging better make me blast an last longer let's go college football
Man bama has gotten so many inadvertant advantages by not playing I'm their ccg. Away team, one less game on their bodies.
How can the *perhaps* greatest college football program in history never find a decent kicker?
Poor Vegas over under of 45 lol
Free football!
I hate watchespn
yeah he obviously tipped off the guy he should do defense first..................................
“What’s the deal with airline food?!”
Stop watching the stupid NFL 
So for a kicker who has now shanked it WAY left twice (and nearly pushed it left again on one of his makes), why are they trying to move it away from the right hash?
I made the OT thread kids! 
Nobody likes a ref trying to show off.
FUCK ALABAMA GIVE ME KARMA GO GEORGIA
Nice low-grade snark, ref..
First ever OT in a Natty in.. a while
I watched most of this game on a potato quality espn "sounds of the game" stream and its mentally challenging me. who would choose to watch a stream without announcing and instead random crowd noises + band? 
I’ll give him a place to stay in Memphis.
as a neutral fan this game has been great after halftime
"Congratulations to both teams, we still don't have a champion." In other words, "way to go, you both choked"
"We still don't have a champion"UCF: *ahem*
Alabama and blundering last second fields goals. Name a more iconic duo.
CHAOS CHAOS CHAOS 
6 threads
Damn it I need to be up at 5
Lmao “that’s what I thought”
Worst part about this kicker is he may very well be called upon to win this game again. His confidence has to be underneath rock bottom...but his nights not over
People saying Saban paid off the refs when Kirby paid off the one player that mattered... Papanastos. 
"that's what I thought" lul
That's what I thought - Ref
The refs are literally telling bama what to do at this point lmao
#TAILS NEVER FAILS!
THERES OT TONIGHT
After that first quarter we deserve extra football
I think he was trying to sound bad ass on the fly, but didn't know where to go with it
That sound you hear is Sean Mcdonnoughs voice cracking so loudly it can be heard from sea to shining sea. 
UCF would've won this game in regulation
"THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT!"-Big 10 Ref
Half the country just screamed fuck yeah while the other half screamed fuck you. Can't imagine being in that position.Edit: World -> Country
Yup
FUCK YEAH!

Thats what I thought  ^^^^bitch
fuck bama
That NBA Saturday Primetime commercial for ABC gives me the urge to kill
Willwescore?
Yes, from the opp. 25
There might just be a tail on the coin.
So will it be a check or cash?
It’s you. I’m in the fucking Caribbean streaming through my company VPN in order to watch this on ESPN and there’s no issue. 
The sub that got me to create an account in the first place 
Oh no, there's a small part of me that wants Bama to win so pappa nasty doesn't cop it too much.
"You want to go on defense first?" Feel like this probably shouldn't be allowed...
Isn't the entire stadium technically at the Georgia end?
I'm dying 
False ref, this is the 3rd place game.
Here we go
Ugh, this feels like the super bowl last year. Damn Georgia teams and football. 
We stole a good one from Saban. Came back to haunt him. Nobody embarasses the Gators in the SEC championship game two years in a row and gets away with it. Eddy! Eddy! Eddy!
Has any team ever not chose defense after the OT coin toss?

“That’s what I thought”LMFAO
Props to Saban for pulling his starting QB when the offense stalled. I hope Urban's watching tonight.
Sir Pappanastos, you are a true friend of the crown.
This is gonna get buried so I'll just say it.  I'm rock hard right now
#CHAOS
It is a tail, fellow kid. What is your choice?
Lets see if alabama gets any penalties 
UCF: Ball don't lie!
**RUN** the ball
“The remaining aaaahhhh-ption”B1G refs confirmed 
"Hurts"
Bama fans have experienced enough titles, they can handle 1 L
I’m nervous because I have to side with a team to enjoy a game most, so I adopted the dawg in this fight.
You all play nice now.
"You want to play defense first?"  Objection! Leading the witness!
Smart ass ref. Love it. 
Praise Jesé for college kicking 
Still hoping for a tie so no one here wins
David Cutliffe Rambling Update: (While watching a replay of Bama's kicker's foot as he missed): > [It's like playing golf]: You attack that driver too much you’re gonna jerk it
Hit em with a “thats what i thought”(Lil bitch)
Yep! 
I can drink to that
I’m in the eastern time zone and it’s 12. Where are you? 
It’s 31° and sweat is pouring from everywhere on my body
IM SWEATING
Never kick a field goal against a Georgian when a game is on the line. 
Here we go boys.
What is sleep?
Kinda feels like Deja Vu
I HAVE NEVER BEEN SO INVESTED IN GOOD DAWGS THAT AREN'T MINE BEFORE!
You're the MVP of this game for saying that
I cant believe you beat us twice
Savage
Same, even though the actual game might kill me
Hi
get a grip
Cmon man, not now. This game has taken about 6 years off of my life. 
This game is like watching Stalin’s Russia fight Hitler, you’re rooting for Stalin, but it’s probably going to end poorly for everyone no matter what 
I just hope everyone has fun
Ref hamming it up
"You wanna play defense? That's what I thought" lol
Damn if Bama loses this game that kicker is going to get so many death threats smh
Goddammit Georgia finish these guys off, for all of us.
Georgia has that OT experience
Smh he had a grin too.
Tails never fails
Whoever Saban sacrificed at half must have been found wanting.  Hope he a had a mouse in his pocket
Typical Alabama fans probably already sending that kids family death threats
Screw sleeping I guess.
I love CFB
Maybe the Seahawks can draft bama's kicker
Lol @ the hatin ass pansies who said they wouldn’t watch the game because it was all SEC and it would be “boring”
I can't handle this shit right now.
how do you have 5-star 13th string linebackers but cant recruit a single kicker better than a u9 punt-pass-kick participant? How do you ignore the a glaring position that is consistently responsible for points in a game?
[deleted]
No
Nah, humble yourself bro! 
Does that factor into this probability? I thought it was just points and time left. 
"That's what I thought"....
I don't trust that Alabama kicker
It is a Tail...
"Just like I thought" wtf
I actually felt physically ill for moment thinking about what that bama kicker must be thinking right now. That is absolutely heart wrenching. 
Absolutely. If Alabama loses that's a legit lifelong regret. Wouldn't wish that shame on anyone. 
You have to know where the Mercedes ball is
Hi
Can they repeat? Time will tell
Right...
More like Kyle Bambard. 
Yes sir.
You're telling me that the stadium in Atlanta has lots of Georgia fans? *Nooooooo*
ref is like yeah i remember our meeting with saben
Should have let 48 kick it
Lotta Georgia fans you say? 
"that's what I thought" -- maybe you shouldn't ask leading questions, ref.
Oh college OT
There's a lot of black players on these teams considering Alabama and Georgia are racist shitholes
Yes
Put Harvey on house arrest 
Thats what i thought* but still lol
No participation trophies
I feel bad for that kicker, he is going to remember that for probably the rest of his life.
Before the kick i was like "no fucking way (this misses)"After the kick I was like "no fucking way"True story
the chokebowl
C'mon DAWGS!!! 
Alabama's kicker bout to book a flight to Japan and visit the suicide forrest
Yes
We trained all year, all our lives...so many 2 thread days, posting comments day after day after day...
“You want to play defense? That’s what I thought” or something corny like that lol
BAH GAWD IT'S URBAN MEYER WITH THE BCS IN THE BANK HE'S CASHING IN
WHERE'S MY GAME LENGTH STRETCHER!
How many OTs until they say fuck it and award UCF the natty?
Lol that ref wanting to be a meme
For the love of Justin Guarini let this one be the Sweet One Dawgs.
This is like the Oklahoma game. UGA could break it open at any second with the run. I think OT favors UGA. 
around these parts we call that a *blessing*
Yes. From the 25
You'd hate to be sitting at the end they aren't playing at.
That V8 from halftime hitting for that ref. 
How could anyone root against a man as handsome as Jake Fromm? 
Nice quick work mods
Oh shit, here we go.
Yep. It doesn't even matter that the team as a whole was more undisciplined than usual, it's all going to come down on him.
both teams get a shot at the 25 and after the 3rd OT they must go for 2 on TDs
Not your fault he made a deal with Satan. 
Fuckin saban fucking with your tv
What’s the Bama name for yips?
It’s getting late 
Is Georgia going to win two OT games in a row to win a national championship? 
dilly dilly boyz
I've got comments in 6 different game threads for this game and I love it
I hope he doesn't have to kick again.
This game will never end because god knows UCF is the true champ 
Its Tua time
"You already fucked one up. It is literally impossible to fuck up a second one." 
Yee
Roll tide
"that's what i thought" = "that's what we agreed on"
We need 7. That’s all. 3 is going to fuck us in the ass.
what's up with georgia in OT games like this. especially in playoff games. I'm not complaining. all playoff games should be like this!
Refs with a sense of humour >

THIS REF LMAO
It'll be interesting to see if Bama can kick to win again, if Saban takes mercy on that kid's soul and send the punter out to try for the FG. 
LOL... wow.
http://www.espn.com/watch/_/id/3267580/sounds-of-the-game-2018-college-football-playoff-national-championship
SAVAGE REF
Off topic, but that ref is a very good public speaker. Soothing voice. Clear and cogent pronunciation. Sorry, back to football talk. 
The fan in me wants this game to keep going.The guy that has to go to work tomorrow says otherwise.
Oh the game went to OT? Wouldn’t know cause ESPN’s stream still has me at halftime
Ref smiling after Bama won the toss overjoyed 
yes
Exactly. He's just a kid, he knows he fucked up. No need for threats or shit like that.
He's great on the mic
For real
Only a punishment if he instead has to live in mississippi
Exact same thought here.
In the 9-6 game in 2011, Alabama made 2 of 6 field goals. One miss was in OT. Saban and bad kicks in big games is a real thing.
How does OT work in college? I rarely watch CFB loledit: nice, sounds much better than the shitty NFL rules lol
What if this game *never* ends? 
I hope they are keeping #48 away from that kicker
Mr and Mrs Pappa nasty are gonna wake up to a burning house if bama loses. :( Rolltide
Fucking papa nastos
Refs helping 'bama out even on the coin toss
when was last CFB NC OT 
But first a message from lil sweet 
Do it Dawgs!
Yes
FUN FACT: B1G Officials are known for their iconic sense of humor 
"Yall ready for overtime? Thats what I thought"
Omg
*48 punches UCF*
No,  both teams will select a player to have a cage match.  Alabama selects 48
Correct 
I quit smoking 2 days ago. I shouldn’t have.
Idea: keep kickers in a very dark room and only bring them out to kick so they have no idea what the time remaining or score is
I know nobody's talking about it, but the falcon chokerbowl was the first SB to go into OT.  Just sayin.
H8 FEEDS UGA TAKE MY H8 FEED ON IT
Reverse Georgia v Oklahoma?
Don’t really like either of these teams and don’t follow CFB that closely but this has been a great game and y’all have been cool as fuck to hang out with 
Stop giving it to fucking Chubb good lord
I literally laughed out loud 
That it's a BIG crew ignoring the shit is just maddening to me. 
Bama's kicker will probably need serious protective custody if they lose this. 
The Reddit app cannot handle this thread, it keeps crashing. 
It was 70/30 at the beginning of the game. Where did those people go?!
Refs clearly rigging the flip for Bama
correct
Yep, they start from the opponents 25 yard line as well now
Lil Sebastian*
Where in hell is Michel? 7 YPC!?!!!
Oh this ref is amazing. Someone get him an NFL job so him and Hocculi can explain things to me.
Tails never fails.
[deleted]
If it comes down to a kicker/FG battle, UGA will win. 
So is this game better than last year’s?
I have to wake up in five hours but fuck me this is gonna be worth it
#PLEASE OVERTIME GODS
We do have a champion its UCF
is there a particular reason you would pick one end of the field over the other?
ITS ALL HAPPENING
I’m just here for the karma.. Oh yeah fuck Bama! 
Will we see the wildcat again?
IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN US
Yeah I cannot imagine. 
Be careful not to *choke* on your aspirations, Bama
Smart has to let Fromm win it
This ref is a fucking MEME
How does a juggernaut like Alabama have a seemingly permanent problem with kickers? It's like, you have all of these mutants at every other skill position, why not some kicker with 50" circumference thighs who can boot field goals 60 yards?
CoinflipGate
we just need to hold them to a field goal
College football has been fucking lit af this postseason 
You betcha 
S C R I P T
Donut
How many times did the ref go over that line in his head?
That kick looked familiar from like 25 years ago. Can’t put my finger on it though...
They each get 1 down 
Do it for the world plz.  I'm an OSU fan but I halfway grew up and went to college in Atlanta.  You guys NEED THIS.  THE WORLD NEEDS THIS.
Snarky ref “ since neither of you mofos wanted this we keep playing”
Georgia just is a magnet for instant espn classics; score rank 1000
Why don’t they do the coin like the semi games?
Mercedez Balls
Bama has looked really good inside the 30 on offense today so I give them the edge here
Holy no face mask call...
you guys needed something tonight. Apparently it was my liver
Who knows, JK scott shoulda kicked anyways
Refs straight up making decisions for Bama. 
Throws NCAA voodoo doll on field in protest
Both teams get a chance to score 
Lol
Working as intended
Someone lost their scholarships  
That's how it works.
Everyone goes on defense first. 
Ok dawgs. Fucking do this please
"We still don't have a champion" hold up referee, have you heard of a school called UCF?!
Thanks Ref I thought everybody is a winner in the championship 
Yup just run it right up the middle in overtime, there's not a Natty on the line or anything 
These refs are so cheeky
The pressure got to him like Bama's kicker
Ref: you wanna be on defense?! \*wink wink\*
that kicker is gonna be murdered if he steps foot back in Alabama 
 The coin was barely spinning on the coin toss.
I was getting pissed that Alabama was going to pull it off in a douchily Alabama-like comeback.With the shanked kick I don't care anymore.
I was rooting for Georgia, but I'm kinda rooting for Alabama now just so that kicker doesn't have to suffer through all of the death threats he's about to get.
Love Chubb but Michel needs to be in... he's the better back
Throwing shade at UCF...
Amazingly. 
They were favorites
"That's what I thought"NEW MEME ALERT
He checked to "Chubb up the middle."  
Big Ten refs showing the midwestern friendliness on that coin toss.
free football
I will pet my dog once for every overtime that happens
I HATE Bama obviously, but I feel so bad for that kicker, whose name I can't spell.
Same 
"that's what I thought"?!?!? Scripted?!??
ESPN is overjoyed they get to play more commercials now
Throw the fucking ball Georgia
That ref was enjoying every moment of that.
Just like he thought? COLLUSION! 
Alabama--you do NOT kick. It's 4th and 10 from the 11, you fucking damnwell go for it!
Get some protection for Pappanasty no matter what happens
This is a neutral site and the stadium banners say "Louder" and "We can't hear you"?
Both of those missed kicks :/
Good cause tbh
That’s what I thought? 
Could have and would have are two very different things.  Obviously, he could have made that kick, but the circumstances surrounding the kick make the would have, much different.
As soon as this is over we need UCF to storm the field in their uniforms WWF style.
Is there a better tradition in College Football than watching Alabama's kickers choke?
LOL the ref loves the spotlight
COIN TOSS IS RIGGED TOO
I hope Scott Frost is naked hiding on the field under the stands somewhere and when they go to announce the winner and hand over the trophy, he streaks on the field and takes the trophy and runs like a madman.
Correct
Yeah fr, this is the last that we get for a while, gotta savor it
Unsubscribe 
or maybe because people have made death threats to college athletes in a non-joking way before, and certain fanbases are more known for it than others
the FPI factors into it I believe
# #ROLLWIDELEFT
Objection! Leading the witness!
The guy with the glasses is better than the Alabama kicker.
That's what I thought...bitch! I'm from the big ten!
Bama won the coin toss. Refs are paid confirmed(/s in case it wasn't clear)
Lmao, they call forward progress so late for UGA, but immediately for bama. 
Pls end fast, I have work in the morning and I'm a tired boy
Run the ball with Michel. Every. Time. 
Serious diddlin time here fellas
Maybe shoulda had a sleepover? ... :')
Only if they lose.
Correct
Only one coin right?
I have to be at work in 30 minutes.  Man up!
YOU'RE GODDAMN RIGHT
It's not. Tons of people have been complaining about it.
If this comes down to a field goal competition we know who wins this one.
Unfortunately I think the momentum is still heavily in Bama's favor and Georgia is gassed
UCF would’ve won this game. 
Chubb gets hit in the backfield and still comes out with like 4 yards somehow.
Should have said, "sorry fellas, game ends in a tie. UCF is the champ."
Me please

What is Brittany doing with her life?
MY KINGDOM FOR A KICKER
Week 1 of CFB Season - Georgia Tech goes to OT after missing a kick to end regulationFinal week of CFB Season - Alabama goes to OT after missing a kick to end regulationGT = Bama confirmed?!
alright you guys, stop making bad NFL kicker jokes lol i've seen like four different teams and at least two specific kicker names
its 1 am please let me SLEEP
Same exact thoughts here 
THATS WHAT I THOUGHT 
This is pain for everyone
I don't know wether to thank Mac for taking Eddy or hate him for it
Even the announcer called him out. We’re not here for you, bitch. 
Only if they lose...
If bama wins it on Georgia's perfect kicker missing I'd literally die
Most teams want to defend first.
Yeah... But he's missed two.
I'm a fan of Bama losing, so the nerves are there
Wat
Still don't have a champion? UCF begs to differ Mr ref
LET’S GO ALL THE WAY TO DECAOVERTIME
There's like a 75% chance that Alabama would lose one of those tosses...Game is rigged for Bama...
"That's what I thought, bitch." - The Ref
Feel bad for the kicker, looked like his foot slipped, don’t know whether it’s his fault it slipped or not, sucks either way
Fucking ref on the coin toss,  lol. 
“We want the ball, we’re gunna score” 
 don't know any 5* kickers.  Not saying there isn't any. Just don't see them now. 
Yes both teams get a possession . Keep going until someone wins
Oh fuck, I'm glad that I'm not an fan of either team, I would be on a nervous breakdown now.
Don't let our Memes just be Dreams.  
Exciting!
Georgia cardiologists are gonna get some good business from these last two weeks
The PAC should be embarrassed for this officiating crew 
I thought you wanted those penalties earlier
Kirk pointed it out as well. You could see it without him saying anything though 
Gloriously
Your student section
Well boys, three years straight of pretty damn exciting championship games.
I have a feeling it will be a non-freshman that will make the play of the game. 
I love that my ESPN Stream is like 45 seconds behind.. the suspense is great..
There were like 5 face-mask penalties on that tackle.
Put it brown, let him punch some more people. 
Hey, he still has a chance to totally redeem himself... or make it even worse.

I'm tryna sleep. 
There’s no doubt Saban told the refs what he wanted. 
This is probably the most fun he's ever had 
Just be like—bye
JFC, throw the ball.
Bruh we got classes tomorrow morning will y'all do the football we gotta sleep
The glasses are gonna cinch this for Georgia
about all they’re good at
Just give the championship to UCF and end the misery
"We still don't have a champion."We get it, you're tired. So are we. My heart is beating like I've run a marathon.
that's what i thought
What would this timeline look like if Bama got 5* kickers?
The fuck is this ref doing lmaoooo
Rules for  OT?
Its the logical choice 
But I can't not watch. About to go 8 months without football
Poor Papa Nasty
sassy refy
His QB's are never that good either.
I hope Uga the Bulldog is okay. This can't be good for his little bulldog heart.

My chest is pounding good lord
Name a duo more iconic than Bama and missed field goals 
Georgia *whispers* "Fuck you Saban. You'll have to pry this win from my hands first"
It's Rinaldi
At least some old lady isn’t “flipping it”
Refs picked the over.
Atlanta sports fans are Mr. Meseeks.
Ha, I've never seen a ref coach a team on their OT selection. 
I hope that kid kicks the game winning FG lol
If that’s the punishment, I imagine Alabama will miss a lot of plays from now on. 
Love snarky ref
You can't be suicidal after your team loses the national championship in OT if your team never gets to the playoffs
I gave up on the stream and turned on my TV like some kind of savage.
You get the ball at the 25 
/u/zskillit you said it was going to be a 5 hour game. We’re at 4+ and counting
Kicking is the only thing stopping Alabama from winning it every year. 
If no team wins in the first OT they should just give it to UCF
I'm just not tunning in. Did I miss anything?
These are some weird as fuck OT rules
I still don't know how 2014 LSU brought Bama to OT
Shoud have kept the ball on the right hash. Would have been right down the center!
OT means more chance for a meteor 
THIS IS WHY WE LOVE COLLEGE FOOTBALL!!
Those who wouldn't watch because there were two SEC teams in the final have missed a hell of a football game.
Here we go, ladies and gentlemen! 
Worked out well for Georgia last time they went first
Home fans? 
I don’t understand why we can’t get a good kicker. Our kickers have been head cases the past 10-12 years 
Ha you could see that facemask in the middle of that pile.
Marty McFly gave me the 2030 Sports Almanac it doesn’t list a CFB champion.... almost as if this never existed....
Man this is fucking lit.
Time for the Freshman kicker
That's what I thought! B1G refs.
Well this has exceeded everyone's expectations, yeah?
Will Bama even try to kick again if they need to? I might put it in the hands of my QB.
Yup. Tit for tat rules. They td you must td 
I mean a team that wins the toss gets the ball second 100% of the time 
A 'Bama kicker mising a FG in an important game?  Well I never.
Pappanastos, to the pit of misery! Dilly dilly!
"One side we have heads, the other side we have a complex differential equation, which side would you like?"
WHO WOULD WIN?1) A scholar athlete at a top institution2) A couple upright bois
All I want for early Fathers Day present is a Bama choke
Georgia needs a TD. That FG shit worked against Oklahoma, but not here.
PROVE THAT REF WRONG FROMM
I’m glad the ref is enjoying himself, but there’s a time and place for frivolity, and the OT coin toss isn’t it. 
Alabama and having shitty kickers no matter what
I haven't missed a minute of Alabama football in probably 2 decades and I can see why you would think that. I also remember the time before Saban when the Earth was without form and void. 
In a dome? Not really. 
Pappanastos is Greek for Aguayo
Scenario:We enter 15th overtime. Both teams are depleted. Every score is matched. Every miss is matched. The game continues. UCF finally arrives at the stadium. Turns out the ball knows who the true champions are. UCF claims the title. Ball don't lie.
lol at the people that boycotted this game
We out chere in overtime.LETS GO BOYS!
WE'RE GOING THIS WAY!YEEHAW
"To the left, to the left".Dude is obviously a Beyonce fan.
Yes even if Georgia scores a touchdown here Alabama will get a chance.
Yeah you could see him talking to him was wigging him out.
This turned out much, much better than I expected.Thanks SEC.God help me.
Why has Michel seen so little of the field? The next big run Chubb has will be his first of the game.
Did this ref just say we don't have a champion yet? Did he not hear about UCF?
Why does Chubb suck now
That kick won't even close lmao
The fuck
Because the Illuminati wanted OT
What will be interesting is if he also leads them to win the game as well
Sadly I’m sure 
Hey guys, I think going up the middle isn't working. 
Saban shoulda sent 48 to the toss for intimidation alone
DO YOUR JOBS REFS. IT'S RESET. CALL A FAIR GAME
Play until the lights go out.
2000+ comments in 3 minutes....
I believe in goggles. A FG is enough to do it.
At least if Bama wins, our new coach will have another ring. ...But I still want Bama to lose
no
put that bed in witness protection asap
Time for Georgia to run it 3 times in a row for no gain
I hate when refs try to be cool. You’re supposed to be a nameless, faceless representative of the rules man, don’t make it about you 
That Bama kicker is Darth Vader in Episode 6 sacrificing himself to kill the Emperor (Bama) to save Luke Skywalker (Georgia)
https://twitter.com/Ermonlane7/status/950593255657426944
In chumm we trust??
As a college football hater, only nfl fan, I love this game
UGA looking like absolute shit. 
I am scared right now...
“We still don’t have a champion.”Some of us do.
This is insanity. 
I, for one, am just happy that college football's dumbass OT system gets such a prominent showcase. 
"In favoring of Georgia."-Kirk Herbstreit
Yeah but the playoff committe fucking sucks
Haven’t had a lynching in a while
why isn’t michel in?
absolutely no way Georgia scores a TD 
Michigan and last-minute punts?
Your autocorrect speaks well of you.
Georgia's playcalling of late has left something to be desired. 
Georgia has played-off pretty good. 
Tails never fails. But Bama is 2 for 2 on coin toss this game. Cheating maybe? /s
Me too thanks
I've got to get work done prior to getting in the office tomorrow. RIP me. 
Start at the 25, 1st and 10, one TO, score and the other team has to reciprocate 
Gotta be there in 5.  Fucking hell I hate both these teams, why am I so addicted to CFB?
How the fuck does this thread have 2000+ comments already?
[Tails never fails!](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/itsalwayssunny/images/7/76/Mac_and_Charlie%27s_team_photo.jpg/revision/latest/zoom-crop/width/240/height/240?cb=20120111101411)
"So how does Over time work?"
I think the problem here is too many people are rooting for Georgia, too many people loving the Dawgs. H8 feeds the dawg. Gotta h8 on 'em for them to start winning again.
we havnt killed any of the others who have betrayed us like this. 
Chubb has like 10 rush yards
“It’s all going according to plan”
But UCF already won the natty!
as a floridian, i am so sick of hearing about UCF
Please no
Harvey Updyke about to burn that kids trees down. 
I honestly feel for the kicker - even if they win.
Not a good call. Going to the outside on Bama? Good luck.
At least college ot is entertaining 
Put Sony in.
why did georgia stop passing at all?
Just realized something. This game is being played at midnight....UCF ID THE REAL CHAMPION!!!
I will reiterate no matter who wins, Georgia has been one hell of an opponent! Godspeed and no matter what happens you deserve this championship
NO CHUBB, ONLY MICHEL!
Got one out of me
Georgia's offense has all but disappeared..
Shit play calls
Use Michel jfc 
I do not understand why they are not running Michel
LOL
Decided by a Kick-Six?
It was just on the menu :(
If only he was great at making calls.
#FEED MICHEL!
Stop running chubb. Michel been doing good 
Future Vikings kicker
WELP. YOU MOSSED IT FUCKER HAHAAHHA
Chubb has done fucking nothing I know he's been a great player for them but they need to go away from him
What.a.fucking.treat!
Andy Reid still calling plays for GA
Kendrick’s performance is alright but the Black Panther sneak peak is dope as hell! Sorry for the spoilees
and a movie!
Think of it this way, I'm sure several Bammers have already emailed and tweeted their death threats so it can't get much worse.
The way the commentators talk, every player is a true freshman!
You always wanna go 2nd in overtime
Dilly dilly!
B1G officials are known for their affinity for blowing blue blood teams like Alabama and Ohio State 
47 minutes of commercials
Nick Chubb sucks.
Run run deep pass, oooof
Throw the ball 
Uga gonna win after papanastos misses another fg
I'm sorry, but Chubb needs to sit.
Checkmate atheists ...
Handoffs to Chubb have been about as successful as me trying to hit on women at the bar 
*48 punches ref*
ref was treating coin toss like open mic night
Quality marching bands tonight 
I see they're taking the Oklahoma approach of losing OT by running it
Plant leg came down heel first and slid which pulled the kick left.
That's what I thought 
shades of pats v falcons superbowl
how many OTs can we get?
Is it Alabama?
Both teams get a possession and it starts on the 20
HOW BOUT YOU PASS THE DAMN BALL
this all turned because of three Bama benefited missed calls in 4 plays in the third:Blocked punt that was negated because of the incorrectly called offside (caused by non-called false start)Next play uncalled PI on Bama2 calls later uncalled personal foul on Bama.All in the favor of Bama. That series took a huge opportunity for UGA and effectively negated the series. Let alone the shocking number of poor calls in the last two series'.I understand the want of officials not to determine the winner, but you still have to officiate equally.
Damn, Alabama got a second (third?) wind.They're looking way faster and stronger than Georgia right now.
Chubb aint gonna get it done 
Don't kick a field goal. You have to go for the TD
Missing that field goal was the most Alabama thing ever.
Or QB
B1g time ref
*and all from each side die in a firey maelstrom brought on by the gods of football chaos*
You always choose to defend, that way you know whether you need to score a TD or not 
You’re probably right 
I'm out of memes!!!! I didn't make enough for Overtime!!!*Uhhhhhhh*fuck Michigan
The fuck are these playcalls
if it goes to 3OT there would be another coin toss.Who's going to write the ref's script for that ceremony?
More stupid and scared Georgia play calling 
They said more Georgia fans were in that end. If they knew that or not, I don't know. 
"We still don't have a champion."BAH GAWD! THAT'S UCF'S MUSIC!
i don't care who ends up winning i just want this to go 7OT so we get CFB a little while longer
I wanna root for Pruitt but I hate Bama but I hate Georgia tooI'll settle for this going 5 OTs due to 9 missed field goals
Georgia's play calling the last quarter has been awful.
This play calling is horrendous 
Thread is up for 5 minutes or less but already 2-3k+ comments. Damn
Why is Chubb in there instead of Michel...?
Y'all love blaming the refs
I thought he did ok. Good personality
bruh haha
Chaney loves to go away from whatever is working just for the lols
Well hes dead if he doesn't go into hiding so might is still accurate. 
Why are we playing like Oklahoma?
There's a really good chance the game is going to come down to that Bama kicker again.
This playcalling is bullshit
Is it just me or do the commentators just sound bored. I guess I'm spoiled by the nfl playoff guys over the weekend. 
make a damn play running for 2 yards ain’t working
Wasn't JK Scott used this year when the kicker was hurt? Odds Saban goes to him?
SUBSCRIBE
Go home Troy I don’t want to see you here 
Is Georgia even trying?
Chubb hasn't done shit today! Stop fucking giving it to him
Yeah, it's kinda like football extra innings.
That’s what I thought
Why are they running it outside with Chubb and not Sony?
Man this Alabama defense is getting better as the game goes on 
Win or lose I think Chaney needs to go this offseason
I've seen this one before. The kicker redeems himself 
Kirby is Anakin confirmed.
Amen. 
Definitely his fault 
committing to the run so strongly in the 2nd half and overtime might be Georgia's undoing.
Georgia seems to be adopting some Lincoln Riley OT playcalling 
NEVER TRUST GREEKS BEARING KICKS
Chubb pls get some yards
Chubb is such a scrub 
STOP GIVING IT TO CHUBB WTF
Chubb kinda sucks.
4 minutes and 2000 comments already sweet Jesus 
"Ya'll needed OT? Hahaha." -UCF AD probably.
Why do we keep going up the middle???
Chubb is a great RB but they have an answer for him on almost every run.
It’s about time Chubb gets to the line of scrimmage
He looks like he wants to die
And like rick and morty level delivery
Bama defense is a little better than OU.
Not in a dome, but it can be a pretty big factor in other stadiums.
Yeah, you want the offense to face your crowd (so it’s louder)
ucf wouldn't have gone to ot
Seriously tho has Georgia ran for more than 3 yards on the outside?Idk why they keep going to it
Lol so they're just going to keep running the ball and not get any yards huh? Bama adjusted, your run plays won't work.
Dilly dilly!
Instead try going up the middle
All Georgia needs is a FG cause I can guarantee you Papanastos will miss a 3rd one. Bama has the absolute most shit luck with kickers.
Bama really needs a better recruiter for field goal kickers lol 
not the time to play conservatively.......fucking go for it
College overtime rules are best overtime rules
i dont understand why Chubb is in over Michel
That ref deserves a raise 
Welp. Advantage Georgia big time if we can't punch it in.
This is too much for me 
If this game isn't over by 12:30am EST I'm gonna need them to decide by deathmatch.
Come on Georgia 
"We still don't have a champion. We'll keep playing until we do."Very movie-like by the ref
That 60 40 a lil more even than I would expect but 'Bama fans would love a road trip of Champions 
I'm guessing both teams end up losing
From Pappanastos to Polychronopolis
#notmychampions
[deleted]
No first down here = game over
As an Oklahoma fan I'm really conflicted right now. I want Georgia to know the pain I felt of losing in overtime, but at the same time I hate Alabama so much and I love crimson tide tears. 
Goggles vs Wobbles. Who wins?
I am conflicted by this post
I respect the commitment to rotate backs, but Sony has been the better by far on both playoff games.
Georgia play calling to death.
hahaha turns his mic off for half a second
Idk why Georgia is running with chubby, Michel has been more efficient all game...
Fix is in for the O/U
This game how now been played on 2 different days.
FEED MICHEL DUMBASS
Should be running Michel. He's having a better night
Just run to the weak side.
Like Saban is gonna kick another FG...
Anyone at a bdubs that can look behind the bar? 
Try one of the alternative streams. They seem to work better.
"Oh my god if I make this I can totally redeem myself! But wait if I miss again...oh..oh god. Uh coach my leg hurts make someone else kick!"
Now all we need is some bullshit DPI on 4th down like in 02 
Casual fans. Better than an extra 15 seconds of commercials
Alabama only paid for the 2nd half hopefully.
It will *this* time.
Amen brother.  
I pay the bills innis muhfuhguh 
Crazy how we remember that fools name lol
Kendrick Lamar claimed the national championship at half and they ended the game. You're really not missing anything
People like my friend who hate announcers. 
Georgia was given 16 chances this game. Bout to shit on all 16
I would say that kicker is gonna get a lot of death threats but seeing as nobody in Alabama can read or write he should be okay. 
welp
I'VE HAD TO PISS FOR LIKE A QUARTER AND A HALF BUT I CAN'T LEAVE THIS GAME
I honestly hope that UGA has to kick a FG. Bama will play conservative and....FG attempt
lol keep on running
only ONE offensive holding penalty the entire game... during a punt return.seriously BIG 10 refs? what game were you watching?
OH NO
Yeah this tri-screen shit needs to go
You WANT to go on defense first. ;)
I can't believe bama's qb's family moved from Hawaii to live in Alabama. Wtf were they thinking?
When you're right, you're right
Fuck yeah. Hell in a Cell. No holds barred.
I'm just happy to be here. Go football.
The ref is trying to be the next Joey Crawford
Chubb is 17 for 24 ... 1.4 avg
Or keep your players from assaulting other coaches 
Crowd noise/ fan seating/ superstition
Fromm, you fucking idiot
THE BULLDOGS HAVE FOUND DE WAY
Good thing PapaJohnpolous is a Senior. He wouldn’t be on the team next year
Can't hate the dude for enjoying himself a bit
Bama’s defense is stronger than him
It's in Atlanta Georgia 
I wonder what year this QB is in college
Good luck returning to school...
Buffalo Wild Wings did it again! 
Georgia still too conservative, that run game never worked once for you in regulation
The Georgia offense is dead, but the Bama kicker is dead too; who will win!?!?!
Jesus Christ
For fucks sake Georgia, stop trying to make up the middle happen
Why run twice there? Counting on Bama kicker missing.
Flipped at 17k, landed at 12k.
Alabama and trophies
Really? You want the guy that couldn't score in the entire first half over the guy with the hot hand that has given you the chance to win?
Poor bastards. 
Georgia playcalling sucks. The toss and slow developing runs don’t work against Bama’s D. 
Since it’s worked so well all game...
Got to love that referee taking extra time to explain the coin toss rules in detail to get more screen time LOL.
Why Chubb? 
maybe they'll win this one
They'll push Georgia to their own 1 and you'll like it
Ref: We still don’t have a champion. UCF: Excuse me.... 
refs trying to sway this shit 
How many OTs do we think we'll see? I'm guessing two or threeEDIT: Well damn...
Oh boy.(Watch him hit this one)
Oh fuk
i cant watch
My lord, is that legal ?
The lines are pretty much given to them.
I was wondering what that was, but not willing to leave the Datacenter stream, since it's the only one I found with announcing AND good image quality.
Oh fuck me. 
I feel like the Georgia play caller is shitting the bed.
Bama is like the horror movie monster that gets shot and set on fire but manages to kill the protagonist anyway...godspeed Georgia
Michele should have been running that.
OH FUCK
THROW THE BALL AWAY YOU FUCKING USELESS MORON
Stop running Chubb jesus
The dude covering his eyes on one knee during his last practice kick on sideline definitely didn’t help
All bout dem yucks
Oh he fucked up
horrible play calling
Game
F
I think we all know where that kick was going after missing the other high pressure one in the 1st
S A C K E D
Huge
Can goggles do it
Way back...
If you refused to watch this game because it's two SEC teams you fucking missed out. 
I’m sorry Chubb I love you but this ain’t working.
ohhh nooo
oh no
omg
Goddamn can't take the sack back there. 
YOU HAVE TO THROW THAT BALL AWAY
If that’s all it takes I’ll go miss a kick 
jesus christ Georgia
Well that's unfortunate Fromm
Well Fuck Georgia 
Too conservative
Wow what a terrible mistake. 
Dude... 
PLEASE GOGGLES KICKER
This game has definitely lived up to the hype, let's go Dawgs
Wow

Jesus Christ
Damn no way. FUCK THAT

THEY CAN'T KEEP GETTING AWAY WITH IT.
Oh that sack is fucking huge.
BOOM
Jesus christ Georgia
OHHHHH NOOOOO
Prescriptions for heart pills in Georgia is at an all time high
oh man... you cannot take that sack...
A FG is still a good get. As we know Bama has kicking issues...
Sigh I hate life
The thing is they took that kicker from Ole Miss when that investigation started!!!
ITS ALL YOUR FAULT
It's 5am for me in Europe.

AMA request: Bama's kicker. Quick, before he gets murdered.

Bama is good
Just wait for the off-season. 
I know, Kentucky didn’t make it again. Wtf
You can not take a sack there Fromm...
HOLY SHIT 
I feel like the only logical thing to do now that this game has gone into OT is declare Pitt national champions 
Lots of Georgia fans have new promises to keep after that miss. 
Fromm you ass
GEORGIA WHY
Oh man, what a horrible sack to take
WHAT A SACK
[Bamas kicker](https://m.imgur.com/gallery/OLvk88I)
Just gonna try it a few more times 
Hey I know you from the other thread I see you found the game
It's better than the NFLs shitshow of an OT.
THROW THE FUCKING BALL FROMM 
dude wtf is this qb doing. 
B O I
Ball game. A Matt Ryan sack 
Rookie mistake Fromm. Throw it away.
Fromm you idiot
Game over
His job season's almost over, got to work on that stand up career for offseason
it's all ogre now
Woof.
Don't run backwards :(
Wow
let's run the ball..
Holy shit didn't the announcer at the beginning during the picks say he thought it would be 27-20?
This game feels like it's been going on for a full 24 hours. I don't remember my life before halftime
The exact thing you didn’t need
I'm just here to say "Papa Nasty" and imma go
I think that kid might actually die if they lose
Always gonna get karma for that
wrong
Louisiana.  Shrimp boats and Swamp shacks.
That's a game.
what the fuck Fromm, you dumb ass
Wow
Fuck I hate Bama all of a sudden
#OH MY GOD, A SACK
why did you not throw it away.....
You fucking moron.
freshman mistake
oh my god
Is Georgia going to pull an Oklahoma
Omg can't get sacked there
Fucking ouch
52-yard Figgie comin' up by Hot Rod
Wtf are you fucking serious
Welp
Holy fuck that's dumb
Georgia what the fuck are you doing? 
Oh fuck
I believe in Goggles. 
If your fans are at a certain end zone, you want to play D on that side.
HBO presents: True Quarterback 
Freshman Fromm mistake
wow Fromm
:( Not like this 
flashbacks...
Over
As someone who only watches CFB during the playoffs, I really hate the overtime rules.. 
Worst possible thing ever for Georgia 
Oh fuck thats game
Oh fuck that. How do you let that happen?
Giving it to Chubb = losing.
"BAMA ball next" thought Clemson was getting ball next thanks for clarifying ESPN
Texas and losing to Kansas 
Why two runs and then pass. Pass the fucking ball.
moron 
The one thing you can't do, smh
Georgia's offense is literally my ass
Man you cannot take that sack.
what a brutal sack 
RIP
We need you now goggles more than ever
YOU THROW THE FUCKING BALL!
4th and a mile for the Dawgs
GA offense has left the building 
“You’re both not champions so unfortunately we still have to ref”
man, fuck that stadium. GT played there our opening game and would have beat Tennessee but for two awful FGs from a kicker who was near perfect the rest of the season. Something about that turf blows. 
He really has been pretty bad

#HE TOOK THE SACK
FROMM WHAT ARE YOU DOING LMAO
true freshman 
Fam......
Throw it away for fucks sake
Georgia long, slow suicide remains eminent.  Jesus christ.
Throw the fucking ball away god damn
Worked out for you so far, don't get upset quite yet.
Dude, you cannot take a sack. 
SACKED OUT OF RANGE BITCH? GOOD LUCK GOGGLES
Fromm, buddy. Buddy.
GOGGLES
Georgia doesn’t even want to win 
Dann it all
Victory has defeated you!  
Nothing will be more unsatisfying than when UGA makes a FG and Bama misses one to win OT
I've just stopped reloading the thread during play action, thankfully there are 8 million commercial breaks
that was fucking stupid lol!
Somewhere, UCF is collectively cackling
Georgia still choking jfc
Oh fuck me sideways
Fromm. What the fuck?? 
That's like the one thing you couldn't have.
Oof. Worst possible scenario.
That's a long field goal. Unfortunately, Georgia can actually kick. 
Well this is a let down
I've gotta say. I love college OT way more than the NFL.
Dude Fromm is losing Georgia the game 
Holy fuck you can't take a sack there.
That is the worst thing that could've happened to georgia. 
Jesus Christ. Haha Georgia has not interest in winning this one 
Wow.  That may be far enough to keep Georgia from getting the field goal.
Chubb hasn't done shit all game, well let's let him run it on the first 2 plays of OT
oh, what a terrible fucking sack
Darkness has returned to middle earth 
This O-line has turned to trash.
dammit Georgia 
HOLY SHIT CHUBB HASN'T WORKED ONCE! STOP!
My stream is down, what did he say?
I dunno. It's close.
Side of the field you have more fans on. In outdoor fields winds and sun, but that’s obv not an issue here.
# FRESHMAN MISTAKE
Holy fuck goergia just lost 
Wow. UGA keeps choking worse and worse. Why would you run backwards and take that sack? So bad. 
RUN MICHEL FFSSS
Wow. What a stunt
48 gave 24 a drink of his water.
DUMBASS
Fromm wtf
What a huge, huge freshman mistake. 
Oh fuck you gotta get rid of that
FROMME baby what is you doin 
Seriously they just gave up on the pass game...
UCF TRUE CHAMPIONS CONFIRMED
Number 48 on Bama doesn't deserve to be part of a National Championship team 
And Fromm makes the freshman mistake taking the sack there. Fuck.
Way to kill my boner
Fromm is stupid for that 
ouch you gotta get rid of the ball
Very smart Fromm
Fuck me https://twitter.com/BuckeyeEmpire/status/950593375287300096
Holy shit
Sitting there for an eternity 
NotLikeThis
You can NOT take that sack, that’s your ballgame 
OH NO
Horrible play calling by Georgia
Andy “Blair Walsh” Pappanastos
I’m not sure it’s a good thing that I know *exactly* the gif you’re talking about...
Just how Georgia drew it up. 
Well georgia didn't  change what their offense was doing. 
Not sure my first two plays in OT would be to the guy averaging 1.4 YPC tonight, but you do you Georgia.
georgia layin an egg 
Georgia trying their best to give the game away
So fucking predictable. Ugh!!!!
How do they not feed Michel that entire drive?
It's almost Hail Mary territory
TRUE FRESHMAN POISE
Gotta throw that away 
Where the kick is blocked, but the kicking team takes it in for a touchdown. That's right, the kicking team.
I do not have a Chubb right now
Well, Georgia got close
Why tf did he eat that
Damn UGA is running an OU overtime lol
FRESHMAN MISTAKE
Give Michel the fucking moment. He has slayed this game. Come the fuck on.
Fromm....come on man
Not like this...
Get the fucking ball out 
Fuck me, Goggles please work your magic
I’m not a football expert but I don’t think that was ideal
Georfia coming out like Oklahoma in the second OT
lol a toss play are you kidding me?
Oh Jake Fromm what is you doin??
RIP Dawgs?
Fromm gave this game away
Wtf Georgia still doesn't want to win.
Chubb has been bottled up dang
keeeeeep on running
Oh my
DO NOT SORT BY ‘LIVE’ YOU WILL GET STROKE
Let’s make sure our kicker has an NFL kick...
You CANNOT take that sack there what the fuck are you doing???
Georgia got gifted OT and is still choking it away 
his run style is just what we are good at shutting down. Figured Sony would be more dominant in this game going in.
Literally the only thing you couldn't do.....
Lol why the fuck do you give up a long sack in OT?
Georgia forgot how to play offense 
Nick:”If you miss this FG, you’re never allowed in Tuscaloosa ever again”Kicker:”hold my ball, watch this”
Go for it. Don't even bother with a FG. Too far. Go big or go home dawgs.
Let's go Jake Fromm State Farm.
You had one job, Fromm.
You cannot take that sack
Bed shitting continues
That Ohio State education paid off, eh? Get a refund. 
you do not know de way
LOL WHAT IS BLOCKING
Can someone explain the UCF meme to an enthralled football fan who knows nothing about college ball?
Woooooow game over
Trash play calls
Nooooo
We can't have nice things 
Matt Ryan flash back
YOU CANT TAKE THE SACK MY BOY
WHOOOO
Oh nooooo Fromm you can't take that
Wow.  Cannot take that sack
ESPN INSTANT CLASSIC 
Georgia's playcalling has been shit since halftime
I mean, if you insist.
“Thanks a fuckin lot”—Georgias kicker
Ahahaha how the fuck are you gonna take a sack there
You had one job Georgia
Come on Georgia D. And their kicker
Alabama just went surprisingly left for the 2nd time in a month
Wow, meltdown
WHY WOULD YOU BACK UP THAT FAR JAKE
FRESHMAN
That was the worst things fromm could’ve done..
Goddamn line
Shout bout to both of these teams who are still hitting hard. They should cancel their classes for a week
Just take the safety
IDK why Georgia has kept Chubb running so much
no worries Bama is gonna miss a 15 yard FG
Lol
He going to kick it right down the middle, isn't he.
How the hell do you not just throw that away if it isnt there
Never give up hope. We could also do with a roof collapse.
Yeah, I think I saw it, too. 
Flair up
Freshman or not, you can't take that fucking sack.
WeLp
Beastly sack
CHOKERS
Can you punt in overtime?
Georgia shoulda pulled Fromm
Georgia choking since half.
Wowwww that OL gave up 
at 50 yards just go for it
:(
Pls goggles
But Georgia should have had 10 more points at the end of regulation.
Fuck it Hail Mary or Fake it.
Why did you take the sack?
PASS THE DANG BALL, ~~BOBO~~ CHANEY.
Take ur upvote
There's a lot of Pro-Georgia salt that's making it rather unpleasant for Bama fans
Bonaire
Goggles out
Georgias play calling is still fucking stupid
So... Michel was the hero last week. He was clearly the better back today... and you rush with Chubb twice in OT?Jesus the choke.
Jesus Fromm..... that's a freshman mistake
"How do I throw?" -Fromm, probably 
why do they keep giving it to chubb when michel has been more successful?
Idiot
Ok you can't take a sack there
If he makes this...
Goggles hits this no prob. 
Oh shit I forgot how college OT rules work
Hahaha that’s a win in my book 
Jesus Christ Georgia, did you take a page out of Mike McCarthy's playbook?Run, Run, Sack.
This game is really coming down to kickers lmao
Damn.  Way to make it a 50 yarder.
R E C S P E C S 
Win or lose, Tua is a legend after this game.
Holy shit that was a bad play not throwing the ball away probably knocked them out of range
Why run Chubb when he hasn't gotten much all night? And why do it twice?
if by "weird" you mean automatically more interesting and fair than the NFL, sure.
COME ON GLASSES
Come on throw the fucking ball
Took a sack? WTF dude.
you see a blitz coming a mile away   u take a 50 yard sackits Matt Ryan all over again this is a real curse
Holy shit...THROW THE BALL
51 yd FG
Omg throw it!!
What if we just ran Chubb up the middle for basically no gain?
I’m appalled 
Yeah, that's exactly the opposite direction you want to go, Jake Fromm...
so...why go back to the run uga? From looks good.
Georgia has blown it absolutely out of proportion
Chill. I don't know if you heard, but he's a true freshman 
I mean it did before. Problem is they're not adjusting
Untrue senior
Snag a 5* soccer recruit?
Duuuuude the ONE thing you cant do is take a 10+ yard sack
Come on, Goggles!
Georgia's OC is fucking stupid.
Don’t fail me glasses
COME ON 4 EYES!!! 
Well, that just got more difficult
You can't take that sack there.
I’m glad the refs are waiting longer to call forward progress than the titans game. 
Chubb got shut down tonight. Why Kirby won't put Sony in IDEK.
Biggest game of the year and my ability to watch it rests in the hands of WatchESPN...pray for me
We could easily have 3 straight missed FGs here.
lol
Mods too busy watching to moderate 
Change to the homer stream. It's awesome. 
Seems like something nick would do
MORE TRUE FRESHMAN
J e s u s c h r i s tESUSCHRIST
Lol...couldn't even throw it away.  College football is amazing.
You cannot take a 10 yard sack there.
Jake fromm sucks, how do you NOT throw that away?
TERRIBLE DECISION
Ok I've been a Georgia sympathizer all night but after the missed field goal... I feel a little more chill
*48 punches kicker*
We ain't come here to play school
Somebody better put a security detail on that kicker
So if it's still tied after ot  UCF is the national champion right?
Targeting glasses engaged. 
Welp, talk about delaying the inevitable.  Only hope is to hold Bama to a field goal attempt.
https://media.giphy.com/media/dCdGHgF7yFHFK/giphy.gif
Seriously?
Surprised the refs didn't penalize a georgia assistant coach for coughing to lour to give bama another shot
Come on squints!
Blankie got this
I believe in goggles boi
Georgia's center has been beaten badly all day. 
I got out of bed for that?
Nothing but respect for MY kicky boi.
I remember the officiating being better last year, and I still hate that a non-conference winner is even here in the first place, so I'd say no.
What a fucking idiot.
This kicker looks like an extra from Full Metal Jacket
Theyre going for 52 yard fg? Crazy
Um, not Pappanastos?
My heart can't take this.
TERRIBLE playcalls
PLEASE GOGGLES
Hot rod!
Neither team deserves it.UCF - You get the national championship
Bama doesn’t want this to turn into a field goal kicking contest...
Goggles is perfect!
This dumbass gon run backward and get sacked smh
Does Georgia know the ot session started?
Come on goggles
Why run so far back you dumbass?
Wow! Fromm done fucked up big on that one.Edit: Nevermind lol
That was a bad time to give up a sack. Great play by that defender though.
RIP Dawgs. Biggest choke in a championship game.
gonna fucking kms right now
Gutless play calling
GOGGLES can do it!!
That kicker was thinking about how much he didn't want to miss, instead of thinking about how much he wanted to win.
they just oklahomad it with shitty play calling
Goggles to the rescue?
WHERE THE FUCK IS SONY MICHEL!?
Fromm.....Fromm.........
Eat shit Georgia 
I’m sure he’ll get a chance for redemption here
[The team winning the OT coin toss was 12-19 in the regular season. Bama hasn't played an OT game this season and UGA is 1-0 after winning the Rose Bowl.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/7jarat/2017_fbs_overtime_regular_season_recap/?utm_content=title&utm_medium=user&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=frontpage) Two other postseason games have gone to OT, but I haven't gathered the coin toss stats on those yet. my computer is updating sorry this was late.
That's literally worse than when Matt Ryan got sacked in the Super Bowl.How the hell you gonna run back 15 yards to get sacked there
Wrong team, ace
Georgia O-line just ready to go home 
Wrong name again fowler. 
...you're welcome, B1G?Am I doing this right?
Each team gets the ball. Whichever team scores the most points on their possession wins. A tie goes to another OT and it's better to get the ball second because you know how many points you need to win or tie it.
I ENJOY FOOTBALL
SEC After Midnight
Let papa nasty kick for georgia
As soon as Georgia is bailed out
Is he wearing glasses?
Georgia team taking a deep sack to hurt their chances... man.
I didn't know Blaine Gabbert played for UGA.

**F R E S H M A N**
Ouch. Good fucking luck, glasses kicker. Damn.
Georgia blowing it again
Good kicker
Holy tits he made it
In case you're seriois, everybody plays defense first if they get to choose. 
Embrace it.
True sophomore??? Redshirt freshman???
By the way here are my headshots hand em out to your friends
Each team gets a possession, if it's still tied they do it again and the team that got the ball second gets it first.After two overtimes they have to go for two when they score a TD.
KIIICKKKKKKEEEEERRRRRSSSSS
GOGGLES!!
Bama wishes they had Hot Rod
What a fucking kick! 
Georgia lost. Game over. 
Just go manJust go

That sack was bad for Georgia. Deep analysis, I know. 
Damn.  Can't do anything but applaud that.
wut
Let’s go glasses!
Georgia kicker "Hey Saban, watch this"*grabs nuts*
Thousands of years of Greek dominance over the world just to get to the point where your descendant misses the biggest FG in CFB history.  Smh should have let Persia take them over when they had the chance
Clutch kick.
Have you heard the news of our lord and savior Rice University?
If Georgia wins, the kicker better win MVP 
Can we buy him?
Well that was some garbage play calling gentlemen.
Someone from Georgia decided to show up in the second half I see
How the hell was he a walk-on?  That dude is $.
Now that's a kick
I need my inhaler
Bama boosters are going to sign that kicker in the offseason, watch
I’m so rage jealous of your kicker Georgia. 
Well shit snacks, you gotta toss that out Fromm.
This dude is way fucking better than Blair Walsh 
Hot rod baby
BAILOUT
Hot rod!!
Wow, the one thing NOT to do in overtime
If he missed that and ALB wins by a FG he'd be crucified
I TRUST GLASSES MORE THAN I DO MY NFL KICKER! FUCK BLAIR WALSH!

Fromm should know better.. even Hurts doesn't take sacks.

Poindexter’s got a leg
Georgia cant help but shit themselves

I trust Blankenship to make it.
Y'all got any more of them kickers?
THE GLASSES. A TRUE STUDENT ATHELTE 
Wow. 
imagine how pissed saban is from watching that field goal go through the uprights lmfao
that was the closest field goal that didn't bounce off the poles ive ever seen
I hear Seattle needs a kicker
Those glasses give him extra powers.
Wow big time kick there. Bama kicker has gotta be embarrassed now if it wasn't already enough for him
And buddy can’t kick a 36 yarder
GOGGLES
Aaaaand Bama gets the W
"I'M HUUUGE!  I'LL WIN THE TOSS 'CAUSE I'M HUUUGE!""That's not how a coin toss works--""I CAN'T HEAR YOU!  ON ACCOUNT OF BEING HUUUGE!"

Dilly Dilly?

Hell of a kick
Neeeeerrrd! who i have great respect for!
It's almost as if you don't know what /s means
Goddamn, that kick. Fuckin W E W
now thats how you kick. But it wont matter. I think bama will score a TD here. 
Hotrod like "fuck it I'll put this team on my back for the second week straight"
Well at least Bama's kicker won't get murdered tonight.
Are we getting close to a record on sacks received? 
Just fucking go down instead of running back 20 more yards..
I LOVE YOU GOGGLES KICKER
College kickers?
Must be fucking nice
Turnover by Smith to end it.
Blanky brought the binoculars out and nailed it.
That's how you kick a fucking football. 
Do you notice how Georgia has a record of 13-1 and Alabama has a record of 12-1?  That's because Georgia played an extra game and won the SEC championship, a game that Alabama failed to qualify for.
Must be nice to have a fucking kicker.
Rec specs out here dominating Bama. 
agree to disagree
GOGGLES is the one true god
Blankenship is literally a legend.
Did that announcer mix up his kickers?
I DONT WEAR CONTACTS EITHER. THERE ARE DOZENS OF US!
Yeah, that doesn't hurt at all!
One of these kickers has balls of steelThe other one really really really wants a TD here
Goggles McKick is a hero
Welp.
G O G G L E SOOGLES
Specs coming in clutch! 
C'mon defense make a stop.EDIT: Also, fuck you Chaney why would you call slow developing plays like that?
WTF were those play calls, Georgia? Did you learn nothing from the way you won the Rose Bowl due to Oklahoma's conservative play calling?
You do not underestimate goggles.
That Bama kicker probably puking right now on the sideline
Pappa nasty looks on enviously
Bama better not have to kick one here 
Those are some sweet specs, Bama kicker take note
Hey Bama, that’s a kicker
Well, we're probably only getting 1 OT because of that kick.  Either Bama gets a TD or they lose.
good god Fromm shit the bed after halftime so bad
Goggles is nice 
"Hot Rod"
Bucs are gonna trade up for goggles
All Georgia needs is a stop. Papanastos is shell-shocked and I promise you he will miss another one.
We totally could’ve beaten Alabama if were just given the chance.       /s
Oh that sack was bigger than that ref's dick!
Goggle Kicker is the MVP of the playoff
BLANKENSHIP??? MORE LIKE CHAMPIONSHIP
Bama is 100% going to need a TD here. I don't expect their kicker to make anything. 
This is increasingly less a battle of titans, and more a game of NO U. 
MAN THAT WAS CLOSE
First player with glasses I've ever seen
This shit is OU Rose Bowl play calling all over again. Something is working amazingly all game? BETTER COMPLETELY STOP AND RUN SOME RANDOM BULLSHIT INSTEAD. 
and number 48
It’s because they’re SEC, it just means more.
SNIPER GOGGLES
Holy shit. Georgia's kicker is the opposite of Bama's kicker.
GOGGLES OUT, DAN. GOGGLES OUT 
It must be nice having a kicker.
The state of Georgia and $$$ kickers: name a better duo. 
When's the last time a kicker has gone in the first round of the NFL draft? This dude might. Holy fuck. 
Nicely done.
I'm fine if we have a kick battle. 
Targeting goggles = $$
BIG BALLS BLANKENSHIP 
No clue why Georgia has continued to go back to Chubb. At least in this game Michel has looked significantly better.
Someone draft that kicker!
See Alabama thats how you kick a fg
Kid's got a fuckin leg
HOT ROD > PAPANASTOS 
Beautiful kick.
GLASSES!
GOGGLES
Big glasses, big leg, big DICK goddamn what a kick
Just don’t get sacked.Idiot.
True freshman
If Alabama loses, the only way Papa Nasty survives is if Hurts throws a pick. Then he dies instead.
And he made it. Damn. Meanwhile bama has missed 2 much shorter FGs that would have won the game.
Relax everyone. The last time a Georgia team blew a sure win, it was in OT. 
Nice kick Nerd 
Goggles with the clutch. Too bad it won’t be enough...
This is spicy
Can't blame refs. Georgia has been diarrhea for possession after possession
Why do college kickers suck so much? Where do the good NFL kickers come from?
Georgia kicker: "hold my beer."  
Jesus idiot get rid of the fucking ball dumbass
Pay the man
If the Dogs win by nailing that kick and Bama shanks an easy one that would be a hilarious ending.
That's you're fetish huh?
What a fucking kick. This guy is clutch as fuck.
If I were a Bama fan I'd want to kill myself 
With those Rec-Specs he could see into the future to the field goal going in
WHAT IS THIS MADNESS!
OH MY GODWHAT A KICK
#BASED GLASSES MERCHANT 
I fucking stayed up late for this fucking horse shit
Bama recruited the wrong kicker
Hot damn that kick
Both teams start at the 25 yard line. Both get a possession. If its still tied they do it again. Starting in the third OT, teams have to go for 2 after a TD
Fuck yea UGA kicker!
Did we offer for this kid in the goggles? We should have gotten this kid in the goggles
FUCKING LOVE YOU HOTROD
Well, I'm singing now fellas. 
Georgia kicker tryna show Alabama how it's done!

Blankenship is a fine kicker.  
BLANKENSHIP HOLY SHIP
I truly hope Alabama wins so Pappanastos doesn’t have to deal with that miss for the rest of his life. 
The only proper outcome for this game is that goofy looking kicker just kicked the game winner, and gets MVP. Anything else is a farce.
I prefer the elbows-out field goal signal over the arms directly overhead. 
Clark Kent with the clutch gene.
Wowowow...wprst play you can make....besides an int

Did everyone on Georgia but their kicker place a massive bet on Alabama at halftime?
The Glasses Man comes through

Damn thats showing the other kicker. But I expect another OT. 
 LETS FUCKING GO GODDAMNIT.

I get the rules, I just don't like it
So the answer to Saban's kicker issues is to find a HS kid who plays soccer, has an overbearing dad, and wears goggles. Simple.
I'm gonna have six different hernias before this game is over 
This is exciting!
Seriously what is the issue with Bama kicking? Does Saban just not give scholarships to placekickers or what?

Well it's only fair when Alabama's kicker is playing like a Viking.

And he made his.
Maybe bama’s kicker just needs glasses?
So that’s what a clutch field goal looks like.
Attaboy glasses
Weird seeing a Georgia team taking a sack when they absolutely couldn’t get one in a championship game. Where have I seen that before?

That man can kick! 
Come on UGA. End them.

Blankanastos
That's the thing. To the team (any team), the message is always "we shouldn't have been in a position to have to kick a field goal." The team will understand that and move-on.The fans lambaste the kicker, though.
missing field goals you're supposed to make it fucking brutal. No one will say it, but you know you've let the whole team down. Felt that way too many times. 
Googles is my spirit animal
GOGGLES OUT!
Georgia's kicker's glasses remind me of Charlie Sheen in Major League.
I can’t watch

what a beast. meanwhile our guy cant hit it 20 yards closer...
I'm using WatchESPN and I'm still behind like 2 plays. Wtf Disney, get it together
So Georgia just needs to make them kick to win.
That kicker just looks like he’s from Georgia
That had like 10 more yards on it.  Dude has a leg
Saban is trying to find his kickers a pair of glasses right now 
G O G G L E S
Bama's gonna score.
Interception. Calling it.
This fucking Georgia playcalling. You have to know you're not gonna have enough time for that drop on 3rd down.
What is the record for FG? 
nobody tell him. 
G O G G L E S  O  G  G  L  E  S

THE MAN, THE MYTH, THE LEGEND. 
UGA KICKING SCOUT DESERVES A RAISE
Bama’s kicker on suicide watch

Rodrigo is a fuckin beauty 
That man eats cheese curds

Pappa fucked them up
Touchdown please
Georgia you fucks, you're making me stress sweat
ME_IRL
This guy could be a good NFL K
[deleted]
Let’s do this Bama for all the marbles
Seahawks taking Blankenship first round
Pappanastos shook!
Pappa is literally dying now
HOT ROD!!!
Clutch af
Win or lose, you best hug your kicker tight tonight, Georgia. Dude's legit.
THEY CAN DO THAT AND WE CANT MAKE A 35?!?!? FUCK FOOTBALL
CHECKMATE ATHEISTS, TO HELL WITH GEORGIA
*overtime. Ftfy
Bama front line is just too good.
Fucking Blankenship
Janikowski?
LETS FIND OUT 
UCF had an undefeated season, but because they are not in one of the Power 5 conference, their strength of schedule was relatively weak so they were kept out of the playoffs by the committee who selects the 4 teams that get t o participate.
Glasses mustache is my favorite kicker in college football 
How did we lose to Iowa by 31.
Saban gonna try to recruit that Georgia kicker while their offense takes the field 
Goggles is a fucking monster 
Jesus, my heart can't take this
rec spec for mvp
No way Saban kicks it if it goes to 4th down
LET'S GO GEORGIA'S KICKER
WHO WOULD WINTHE GREATEST DYNASTY IN CFB HISTORYONE HIPSTER GLASSES BOIEDIT: LOOKS LIKE ITS THE FORMER
GOGGLES YOU BEAUTIFUL SONUVABITCH
Must be nice having a good kicker, Georgia.
Bama got a backup freshman kicker laying around? 
TD or Bust for Alabama
https://youtu.be/EW85eGmydEI
Does Bama even attempt a FG here or do they just go for the TD?
TY
Tom Rinaldi. The guy that does the sob story every week on Gameday
If this goes to 2OT I will pull a marlyn Manson and take out a fucking rib 
Do we get a newthread for each OT? 
That dude has ice in his veins, holy shit
Way to go specs 
GO GLASSES KICKER
Basically UCF went undefeated this year, but they play in a "lesser" conference so they didn't get into the playoffs and have decided to just claim the championship anyway.
Holy hell. Ice is in that four-eyed bastard's veins. 
Shea Serrano lookalike is a much better kicker than Alabama's Papapasto guy.
Bama bout to score in 1 play
That dude's got a boot..
I had a thought in the first quarter that Blankenship would be the MVP. I might be right
Georgia’s center fucking sucks Jesus Christ. Hipster kicker saves the day
They should call the win for Georgia after those FG attempts on both sides
Tampa Bay should trade up to take Blankenship in the 2nd round
Nah, Fromm would. 
Haha we just said that too! But that’s Blankenship. They got his name wrong 
This is all weird as hell hahaha
**48 punches field goal**
PLEASE INTERCEPT THIS
Holy fuck. Can't wait to see that kid in the NFL.
MVP
PAPA MISS
The state of Georgia and blowing leads
Janakowski in 2001
Janikowski was a 1st rounder right? 
if it comes to a fg in ot does saban kick?
lol
WHAT A FUCKIN KICK
Who would win? A college football dynasty? Or one big glasses kicker boi?
Bomb of a kick.
Fromm just took the sack just to make Blankenship look good
one stand, georgia D
This game is a complete mind fuck 
Now THAT is a kicker! 
WILD THING 
What a beautiful kick
Annndddd bama scores
GOGGLES!
I like to picture Blankenship staring down Pappanastos as he was no-look kicking the 51 yarder
If Bama gets a 4th down they go for it
Georgia got bailed the fuck out
Put some glasses on bamas kicker
Dude is actually the MVP if they win.
my stream is behind and im getting drunk anxiety reading thies  and knowing he made it then getting more anxiety watching it again
why? 
Great kick to salvage that possession.
Those socks have got to go!!!
Wow
Nah, depth of the bench for a team that has racked up National Championships versus another team...nah, I mean, GA is tired AF. 'Bama still has fresh legs...
Goddamn Blankenship. That dude might win Georgia a championship. 
WHAT A FUCKING KICK!#RODRIGO FUCKING BLANKENSHIP
LOL that Four-Eyes probably can't even see the goal from 50 yards out
Yeah I like saying pappanastos as much as the next but cmon man 
I mean, I'll take it if it's due to overtime! I'm not ready for CFB to end.
No but really you could see his dick
MAKES IT LOOK EASY
MAKE BAMA KICK! MAKE BAMA KICK!
Wow, glasses got a leg!
Oh thank god. the overlords don't need another championship. 
Kicker pulling them out of the Pit of Misery.
Goggles holy shit!
Now that is a kicker. 
Come on Bama, TD
Hot Rod
He gets laid regardless. Blanksenship is daddy
You'll have to talk to auburn or ole miss about that 
That's what a kicker looks like Saban 
Albama heartbreaks from kickers is a trend I can get behind. 
I want to see Bama's kicker again.
BIG DICK BLANKENSHIP
27-23?edit: oh .. forgot they don't kick the fg
This fucking kicker is the man 
How does he take a sack too?
Clutch...
Im 100% not lettin pappadakis kick another one
Those Clark Kent glasses
Completely a joke
Blankenship should be the CFP MVP.
watchESPN is so garbage. 100 mbps connection and this shit is constantly buffering
Can you imagine if Pappanastos missed the game winning kick and then misses the kick to lose the game lol
Blankenship now owns Pappa’s mindspace
Bama’s kicker should’ve worn goggles. 
What a kick
Rodrigoooo
Bama should use their backup kicker.
BLANKENSHIP JUST STAMPED HIS TICKET TO THE NFL, ICE IN HIS VEINS
GOGGLES = MVP
Papanotasgood as that
Yo watch this georgias kicker just made a 51 yardsr and watch theirs kiss a 30 yarder lmao
Porn stache has legs
Hotrod looks like Pedro from napoelon dynamite 
Georgia, is your kicker declaring for the NFL, he'll have a job with the Seahawks if he does!
Now that's a kicker 
I want a blood test from that man. Only a man filled with ice could make that look that easy.
You trust Alabama's kicker in OT?
That's a kicker
Glasses, accuracy, distance. He is the total package 
If only.  He deserves it more than anyone
These kickers names are tight lol
Hot Rod fuckin rules
GLASSES BOI
Good job Goggles. Now the Dawgs need to stiffen up.

Blankenship the new Matt Bryant?
You could say that for any team's kicker honestly.
Kid's a fuckin sniper
Not fair, that fucker can see a mouse 5 miles away with those binoculars 
The glasses on that kicker makes me think of Wild Thing from Major League.
YASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
Issa Blankenship. 
Now that's a worse sack to take
WHAT THE FUCK
Have any money left after buying the refs?
Oh no. If Bama kicker misses another...
YESSSSSSSS

Odd play call to lose 17 yards 
RIPPPPPPPPPP
SACKED!

THATS HOW YOU KICK AN FG BITCHES
Holy Hot Rod, Batman!!
Bama loses if it's a kick. Pappa couldn't make a 20 yarder right now much less 50.
UGA kicker: gogglesBama kicker: no goggles
Depends on the stadium but it could be wind, team fan concentration, kicker preference, field condition and so on.
HOLY SHIT, IT IS HAPPENING!
FUCK YES
PUT HURTS BACK IN
WHAT THE FUCK LMAO
#AHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Will special teams cost saban another championship?

Whoa, it’s almost like this is the first game he’s ever played

SAAAAAAAACK
WHAT A DUMBASS LMFAO
Peppridge farm remembers
MAYBE THE BAMA KICKER NEEDS GLASSES LIKE THE UGA KID
LMAO
AYYY
I guess Saban figures that statistically speaking 5 Star DBs and RBs and QBs and OLBs and WRs and RGs and LGs win more games than lowly kickers 
oh my fuck
What indie band is Blankenship in? I have probably never heard of them. 
Well is this a kicking battle now ? *gulp*
51 yards, clutch! nice
LET'S GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Lmaooo omg the choking

Please let this come down to a Bama FG attempt..... Or a sack at the 42...
Holy fuck these qbs are fucking crumbling!!!

Lmao. "UGA what a shit 3rd down sack, lemme show you how its done."

That dude has been a savior for Georgia in the playoff 
Roll tide

"That's not a sack *this* is a sack" - Georgia
This game is a fucking movie
Kids about to be real solid in the NFL
WHAT ARE YOU DOING????
Mr Glasses Kicker is a beast wow
Yikes there's the freshman showing
LOLabama 
Thats whats up!
Did you know these guys are freshmen? 
Saban looks like he's going to explode

DAWGS DAWGS DAWGS
SACKRAMENTO
ICE IN MY VEINS - Glasses kicker
Bama kicker looks like he wants to be anywhere but where he is
What are you doing?
Apparently it takes being at least a Sophomore to realize you should probably throw the damn ball away in OT.
At least one team signed a kicker 
Fuck yeah
Hahaha
throw it away!!!
Freshman qbs amirite?
Raiders drafted a punter in the first round not too long ago.
Who the fuck did Sony Michel assault during halftime to not see the ball
O MY GOD THE true freshman GOT FUCKED 
Hold them to  a FG try and ya got this dawgs.
I'm honestly thinking that the kicker should be MVP.
2nd and 63792963891
Frosh gotta Frosh
These QBs all SUCK at avoiding sacks.
Haha these are definitely freshman 
Georgia pls
WHAT IS HAPPENING
I like having a kicker that can kick
Nick Saban looks like he just shit his pants
Ugh.
Lol what an idiot 
The QBs don't know what direction they're supposed to be going
True freshmen at QB
Sack lunch!
Can’t crucify a kicker for missing a 50+ yarder, they just can’t be expected to make those even for most NFL kickers.
Don’t tell Tampa
Wtf who wants to win this game
These freshmen QB's....
ARe you fucking kidding meI am going to pass out
WHAT WAS HE THINKING!?!? LOL
is the Georgia kicker an nfl prospect?
YES SIR
ANOTHER ONE!!!!
dude #13 is an idiot oh my god. I LOVE IT
REC SPECS
So who in the NFL needs a kicker?
“Watch and learn.” - Blankenship
Googlez saving Georgia for another series of trash offensive playcalls 
fucking CLUTCH omg. Just shat directly on the bama kicker's face.
Dumbass moves by the QB
Tua needs to learn to throw it away. 
Sabans gonna cry
That was bad for Alabama's chances 
this game is fucking nuts
What a mess
Really hope the freshman can look like a freshman right about now
Get rid of it, stupid.
He’s freshmaning it!
SACK BITCH

Ho Lee Fuck 
That mother fucker better be accurate with those scopes he has in front of his eyes. 
QB's are trying to out-fuckup each otherEDIT: Lol, maybe he was just giving himself space for that pass.
Tua wyd man
TRUE FRESHMAN
The fuck are these QBs doing? Nobody knows how to throw the ball away at all. 
They saw that screen from the snap. 
Freshman or not you need better sense than that.
Well that was not ideal
Yyyeeeeaaaaahhhhhh BOOOIIIIIII
Jalen Hurts: put me in coach. 
Dude is gonna be a pro
Pappanastos' worst nightmare is an endless OT decided by who can kick the most consecutive field goals.
LEGGOOOOO
Um...

Great kick and glad they got the 3 points but god damnit Fromm, what the hell are you doing?

What the fuck is all this sacking all of a sudden?
DEFENSE!  DEFENSE!  DEFENSE!  DEFENSE!
MLG right there
Joe Buck quality level of work there
Hurts wouldn't have taken that sack /sEdit: nevermind 
Hope they remove the Alabama kicker's belt and shoelaces before boarding the team plane tonight. Seriously. 
Hurts feels so smug right now 
That was worse than Fromm's sack
I want those glasses. 
As a neutral, I love this game...
HE TOOK THE SACK !?
OMG I thought he lost it
Huh, that could hurt Bamas chances
HE'S SHOOK
Ouch
tAkE hUrTs OuT oF tHe GaMe
Pappanasty.
Ball game.Daboll got cute one last time
HOLY SHIT
Holy. Killer D. QB needs gogglesEdit: he put on his goggles
Triplette would have clawed forward progress 
PUSH HIM BACK
This may be the worst OT playing I’ve ever seen. 
Eh, the Bama kicker can nail a 60-yarder. No worries.
What is this game?!?!?
oh yea see i don't think you want to do that 
Does Saban ever actually have his headset on?
FRESHMAN MISTAKES
What a twist
Sam Darnold wouldn't know it any oda wey
fucking amazing. 
Tua what is you doing?
Okay, two SEC teams don't deserve to be in the National Championship. This game proves it. So sloppy.
Second round. My bad.
**FRESHMEN**
GGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG
Saban looking like an evil splinter over the last half hour.
DPI incoming
Could have hit that shit from 65.
YES!!!!
lmfao if it was Bama, they would've punted it to prevent kick 6
Oh shit lol.That tune Georgia plays...I've only ever heard it from Georgia Techs video "To hell with Georgia!" So when they okay it I start singing it.Whoops
Freeeeeess$hma a nnn n
Hot Rod!!!
Lol they wanna try and match a 60yarder
Why do they start from the 30 
Beautiful 
Dude I would not be surprise if there is a hate subreddit for him right now. 
Fr fr, couldn't look away from those steel balls
Small sacrifice to pay when you get to see Bama lose
These freshmen doing freshman shit
Saban went down to Georgia, he was looking for a bowl to steal...
so youre saying theres a chance?nevermind
YESSSSS. FUCK BAMA 
Us Georgians understand the importance of a good kicking game. 
If Bama had a kicker like that, they would've won already
Fucking fantastic defense there wow 
Holy shit
Throw.  The.  Ball.  Away.
Live by the true freshman, die by the true freshman!
oh, THAT was the worse sack
Bama line holding again, what else is new
This game is stupid drunk
Tua outchoking Fromm.
I thought we got over that. It was corn man. Iowa corn production outpaced Ohio.
I guess they never got to teaching the freshman about throwing away the ball
"Where can I get me one of those?" - Nick Saban
LETS GOOOO
Jalen Hurts doesn't take that sack.....
Defense! Hunker, down, defense! Stuff them you damn good Junkyard Dawgs! Give us our miracle you Dawgs!
Man, I think either way this game is going to end on this Alabama possession. Are they really going to try to attempt another kick with the game on the line?
Neither of these QBs knows how to throw it away!
Shades of OSU Purdue
THATS BALL GAME WOW
The ol 16 yard sack...
The Georgia kicker looks like the kind of guy that openly talks about his hentai collection.
He was playing well but he's still a freshman.Edit: well fuck me silly.
Holy shit, if they get the stop, this is a win for Georgia.  Does Saban put this in 4 down territory cuz Pappa sux?
Get rid of the ball, dumbass lol
Imagine if Bama’s kicker has to go back out there to force double OT...what a nightmare for him. 
OH BOY
Possibly not the best idea there...
HOLY FUCK GEORGIA DO THE THING
Erect. Fully.
BAMA QB SAYIN HOLD MY ODUELS
AS SOMEONE WHO WEARS THICK GLASSES, I'M SO PROUD OF THAT KICKER.
That  "woo" tho 
Goggles comes through!!!
No wonder he can hit 57 yarders.
Especially if they lose
WHAT IN THE WIDE WIDE WORLD OF SPORTS IS A GOIN ON HERE?
Apparently throwing the ball away is illegal in OT
Well thats what happens when the backup QB is there. Should have thrown it away. Edit: And then he wins it. Lol
saban going for it on 4th for suee
Sack of the year!
Fucking crazy.
Georgia gets a sideline warning but Saban can go wherever he wants on the field?  Wtf?
Try the Spanish stream. 
Saban 100% about to go in that tent and jerk one off 
True Freshman Qb's aint lookin too hot now
What a kick
True Freshmaning right there. 
lmao, the kickers glasses. Looks like a white Urkel
Subscribe.
The D's ain't fuckin around!!!
Groucho made a helluva kick 
OMG
He's losing the convertible for that.
Georgia can kick
Bama’s kicker needs some glasses I guess...
What a thing of beauty.
What happened?
It’s bad. Stockholm syndrome, dude. We’re too used to these B1G refs.
This is Comedy

Are those SportsSpecs ^TM on the UGA kicker??
 Blank kicking in glasses you fuckin G

Anything UGA can do, Bama can do worse!

Jalen looks upset

Well fuck
....
WHERE DO I GO TO JOIN THE BLANKENSHIP CULT?
Say what you want about whoever, but that kicker deserves to get drafted into the NFL.  Making a 55 yard field goal in overtime in the National Championship game?  That's worth something in the league.
you thought fromm took a bad sack?
LMAO 
LOOOOLLLL
WHELP!!!
im dying.
uh no lol
how the **fuck**  do these guys keep taking sacks
I'm starting to feel sick for the Bama kicker right now.I have no idea what he's like as a person but I don't envy his position if Bama can't pull this one out.
Rip
O no ....
That was one hell of a kick.
True freshmen QBs and getting sacked for 10+ yards. Name a better duo. I'll wait.
Damn nice kick 
Holy shit it's going to be up to a field goal by papanasty
Wtf
Sebastian Janikowski was drafted 17th overall in 2000.
Overbearing dad?  Story/link?  
FUCKKKKK
Lmao
WHAT THE FUCK

SABAN SMILED.  Maybe even laughed.  I am fearful now.
Respect where it's due, They deserve it man. Wouldn't have even gone to OT if they had a decent kicker, wouldn't even have come down to the end of regulation actually. ALL Bama second half. Saban is a legend. 
What. The. Fuck. Wow.
What did i just watch
HOW DO YOU LET THEM BEHIND YOU ON 2ND AND 26
just like that Saban said it was time to win
I decide to watch one too damn long college football game, thinking "Hey, maybe I can watch Alabama lose. I hate them like the Pats."Way to blow it Georgia.
Still though, that was a perfect throw. What a great game. 
I feel bad for Jalen Hurts. 
Wow great to see the committee give a hard luck team like bama a shot to win it all what a cinderella story
  YESSSS FUCK GEORGIA GO TO HELL

Time for shitposts boys
well, he can throw the bomb
This espn interviewer was so lost as to what to do when Saban asked that question. He's like a robot. 
Awkward interview
#  FUCK YES 
Vat da fuk
It’s the fucking evil empire I swear
How do you let him get so open
2ND AND FUCKING 26 AND THEY WIN IT! HOLY SHIT!
BELICHICKSABANSHERMAN GG ATLANTA
SO to that corner blowing his coverage
I don't understand how Georgia's defense can be so brilliant in one play and then so utterly, unbelievably blow it the next. 
I used to think Saban sold his soul to the devil. I’m now pretty sure he is the devil himself. 
Saban just broke that reporter 
Georgia fans got REAL quiet.
God damn that was so clutch. I can't get over it. Holy shit
I'm pretty sure we would have beaten everyone by 75 points had Tua been playing all year.
FUCKING TOM RINALDI ANSWER THE QUESTION
AND NONE FOR YOU ROQUAN SMITHYES IM STILL BITTER
BmAm DoeSnt DesErVe To Be In THe PlAYoFFS. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
WR
Hey you gotta give the true standouts some credit though.  I mean, the refs really stepped up and helped their team to a national championship.
Alabama at halftime- hey you guys remember New England v Atlanta? Georgia: Hold my beer
Wow. After the big sack that wasn’t the play I saw coming. The robot announcers are in a True Freshman playback loop
Worst timeline
Them Dawgs is hell don't they
r/CFB on suicide watch right now
Is...is that the most georgia sports way to lose it?
Tua for Senate.
What a choke job
That was a beautiful throw and catch

Great, Saban's Alabama with a functional QB. Welp.
Wide open lmao 
You know everyone hates the sec and I hate bama but we sure as fuck know how to play football. Now give me my coach Bama!
Well damn
Nick Saban is the greatest couch in CFB
When people say an all sec championship would be bad 
Omggggg 
Fuck this game 
Holy fucking hell that was just insane.
Wow. That qb totally turned the game around 
No matter how many times Saban finds himself in this situation, he always looks uncomfortable being touched by others. 
Sorry, Jalen.
The balls to pull Hurts and put in Tua are enormous 
Looks like Lebron's winning another NBA title this year, folks.GG Bama
That's what happens when you get a lead and take you foot off the gas.
UCF FOREVER IN OUR HEARTS
Fromm gave that game away
Eh.  That was pathetic
OH MY FUCKING GOD WE’RE NATIONAL CHAMPS
#UCF NATIONAL CHAMPS
I'm done. Fuck everything.
T R U E F R E S H M E N
Well, there's a socially inept reporter. 
TUA IS JESUS
hahahahahahahaha
Did Nick Saban just start bleeding from the nose? Ummm
Gross
Delicious!
overthrow by 5 yardsoverthrow by 5 yardsoverthrow by 10 yardsoverthrow by 9 yards sack for a loss of 10 perfect bomb 
Did Bama win, or did we all lose just now?
Congradulations to UCF the 2018 national champions.
fuck bama 
See ya Jalen, better start looking for a job
Good for that tiki boi
seeing this comment so late makes me so sad...
Sam Darnold can still win this game 
Jalen Hurts has declared for the NFL draft.
Saban: WAS THAT A GOOD GAME OR WHAT.
There are only 49 states in the Union. Georgia is nothing but a meme now.
Did UGA just one-up Atlanta?
HOLY SHIT
GIVE ME YOUR SALT r/CFB
Cannon arm. 
Really? 2015 is long overdue?
UGA was still celebrating that sack and got caught off guard. Their showboating lost them the game.
Oh fuck, I can’t believe you’ve done this.
UCF going to run in any second now. 
Lol they didn’t know what hit em 
Oh my god.
Those true freshmen tho
RMFT!!!!!!
Game never should have even went to OT. So many missed calls going Alabama's way
Why did nick yell at the cops about?
Goddammit Georgia. Soft ass defense. Chokers. Go down in history as chokers. 
Yes!!!!!!
What a throw!
Are you 2bproductions2bc?
No. 
“I’m asking the questions” 
That ending came out of nowhere wtf. Where was that this whole game? 
Fastest collapse of Georgian defenses since Sherman in 1864
GEORGIA https://streamable.com/2jkcj
i......i............what....
Unbelievable game of football. I adore this sport man.
GOTTA GIVE THE TROPHY TO THE REFS OR ATLEAST LET EM HOLD IT FOR A MINUTE. Lol
FUCK WATCHESPN missed the last play....
they didn't deserve to be in*
Georgia defense one question. How can you do your kicker like that after he made a 51 yard attempt?
14 should be bared from every playing football again.  Worst game I've ever seen from a defensive player.  Burned repeatedly, costly penalties, absolutely horrible.
Penn State level turtle up
The kicker won't die now!
“Have no faith in this team smh”“Bama till I die I knew it!!!1!1!”
We don’t belong though!?!!?!!?
I think Jalen Hurts had a 2 and 25 record as a starter during this game
browns
That Hawaiian qb is unreal
LOL
YES YES YES YES YES YES I LOVE YOU BAMA 
hoooooooly shit
HUMBLE YO SELF. 
It's like they wanted to lose. What the hell was that coverage?
DUMB ASS FUCKING GEORGIA IT WAS 2ND AND 26!?!?!?
Ughh...
Boston College 
How? They won legit af 
ROLL TIDE
If you get sacked you get more room to get separation downfield. 5D chess.
Tua going to be absolutely drowning in women later.Edit: drowning in Jesus.
THE LEGEND OF TUA TAGAVOLIA!!!
Another one
I hate sports
Signed, sealed, delivered from the Zebra to the Tide. Absolutely pathetic game. I'd be embarrassed to be an Alabama fan today.
I’m not sure, let’s ask the announcers.
#GEORGIA BLEW A 20-3 LEAD
Georgia teams are a meme.
WHYYYY in the fuck do you not just run Cover 4 jfc
UCF national champs!!!!!
Did not expect that ending at all. I thought the game was basically over since their kicker sucked. This was really fun see you guys next year 
Never cheer for a team from Georgia
Nick said fuck your interview
THEM DAWG SAFETIES IS SHIT - DON'T THEY?!
What
Fuck it, as a neutral fan im glad i witnessed this game. This was a great first cfb game of the season lol  
Overwatch! 
What a fucking rollercoaster of a 4th and OT
That kicker is the luckiest guy in the world right now. 
Can’t wait for that Bama -UCF game next week!! 
Did the safeties just not exist or something? Horrible job by the secondary.
Bama finally has a legit NFL tier QB. Lookout. That lookoff though. 
Saban:>We are onto the offseason. It's time to put this behind us.
This truly is the darkest timeline.
Can Saban just retire now?
Fuck saban 
Well fuck everything 
Be actually a really bad football team 
That sucked
HERE'S TO SEPTEMBER 2018!
Take a drink for Everytime they say true freshman
jesus.. how does that happen.. wish they would show a replay
Georgia wtf was that coverage?
[me irl](http://i.imgur.com/alwVoMD.jpg)
TRUE FRESHMAN
Saban got punched in the mouth.
[me irl](https://files.gamebanana.com/img/ico/sprays/57822c19e1ad1.png)
HAHAHAHAHAHAHA THE BULLDOGS JUST CHOKED SO HARD!!!!!!! OMFG THAT WAS CRAZY!!!! 
Concur. FUCK. 
I really can't fuckin wait til that dude retires
Even tho the refs were terrible, that bama qb is for real
So are all the salty UGA fans going to start backing UCF's claim now?
C H O K EHOKE
...Okay.  GG, I guess.
Nothing but respect for *my* champions, UCF
Transfer incoming.
:')
no
He's going to Takeoff now 
Hawaii boy can throw it long. Decison making is shit, but dat boi won
Man, you had them back near midfield and you give up a WIDE OPEN touchdown?
Tua is getting a statue in Tuscaloosa. 
I fucking love you Tua!
wow this game really would not have been close if tua played the entire game
Fuck everything
Roll Tide!!!!!!!!
AlAbAmA dOEsNt DeSErVe To bE In tHe PlAyOfFs
Georgia puckered.Jesus what a choke.
They were straight up gassed. Nothing left in the tank--NOTHING.
True FR QB comes in at half and wins the NC wtf
I should be used to this as a Georgia sports fan.... But no fuck this, I'll never get used to this
That QB probably just saved his kicker's life, though. Imagine had Alabama managed to lose that game after that missed field goal.
Fuck ducking everything . 
Saban is classy as fuck with this interview.
College football's over for the year... fuck now what do I do with my life? ;-;
I've just come to accept that no team I actively support will ever win anything, sports are bullshit anyway.
FUCK THE DOLPHINS FOR TAKING SABAN FROM US
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Congrats to Alabama for their second place finish to UCF. Maybe next year.
Won because of a chokehold on a TD play, can't wait to hear all the Alabama fans complaining like they did last season... wait, they're petty pieces of shit, nevermind.
NFL scouts are for sure going to have him on their radar
Fuck....
WHAT A GAME!!! WOW!!!! Just said f' it and threw one up for 500! 
AWKWARD INTERVIEWER 
Tua overshot every (or nearly every) long pass tonight, even with his receivers leaping and fully extended in their attempt.Except that one. That was dropped on a dime, in stride, to the exact right target.
How the fuck you give that shit up on 2nd and 26, something bout these damn Georgia teams and leads
WTF
The one time you should play prevent defense and keep some of your secondary deep. For fucks sake Georgia
Well, that was shit.  Fucking bama again.  How exciting.  Bama next year?  And the Next year?  And the next year?  Yay.
So this is how life in North Korea is
What a blown defensive play.
Meh. What a let down
Imagine how much crazier this game would have been if there were true freshmen that were playing
GRAB YOUR SISTER AND GIVE HER A BIG KISS!
This is the darkest timeline.
Alabama wins the Alabama invitational... again.
2nd and 26 just put everyone deep. What the fuck
What a horrifically blown coverage.
Tuaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
LEGEND
HAHAHAHA
There is no justice in this world.
Tua will be kissing some serious titties tonight. 
That was insane 
im just hear to upvote all cameraman banter
[deleted]
What
Jesus, the curse is actually fucking real 
POST BAME TBREAD MODS
I'll never understand these defensive backs who just stand and watch a WR run past them.  What do they think is going to happen?
That was disgusting. Sacked for 16 and then throw the GW TD?
Mother. Fuck. 
2nd and 26 and they play man defense? This whole overtime seemed so weird. Like everyone except that receiver decided to play as bad as they possibly could.
FUCK BAMA GOD DAMN IT ALL TO HELL
Tagovailoa is a legend
As a Bears fan. This makes sense from Mel Tucker
That poor photographer...
all hail the great tua
What a voice crack LOL
Hahahahaha
Saban's having relations with his wife tonight. 
IN TUA WE TRUST!
Welp, at least LeBron just won a 'ship
I can't fucking breathe oh my fucking fuck fuck holy fucking shit 
Georgia teams in football championships are like the Luftwaffe on the History channel: fucking doomed.
hmmm.... well hell of a game, but in OT that was inexcusable after that sack.
Man Tua is barely even celebrating lolSo calm
holy hell what a throw
Goodnight Georgia thanks for playing 
Imagine how good this game would have been with 2 Playoff caliber teams instead of 1.
that corner was burned 15 yards out of the goddamned endzone...un fucking believable
True true
Our national champion didn’t win their conference 
I've heard stories about the weather and ladies of ASU. I get it...
THEY CANT KEEP GETTING AWAY WITH THIS
GEORGIA YOU PULLED AN OKLAHOMA WYD
oh Bama won. how interesting and exciting for the sport /s
Im gonna put on my tin foil hat. The refs helped Bama bc theres more money to be made off their championship win since Bama has more fans. 
YEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Thank fuck
THWg!!!!!!
How exactly did the refs cause Georgia to run cover -1
Talking about the GA kck in ot
It was clearly a penalty, it's been proved over and over again
rip r/cfb
Georgia is always choking on something!
FUCKITY FUCK FUCK FUCKITY FUCK FUCK
georgia is a fucking trash state
Last year's was better
They were taking deep shots the whole game and on the most important play of the game they give up a long touchdown, wow. 
Congrats to UCF!!!
Saban is wired
AND THAT A-HOLE IGNORED THE gODKING?!?!?!
Actually they're the National Champions, for some weird reason alot of people seem to think its some nobody school from the AAC
This shit is just getting old with Bama either winning or being the runner up every goddamn year. Like, I know my teams will never have a shot at winning a title but it's not fun to watch the same team always winning. 
Aint it so.
No kidding
How salty are you?
- never deserved a playoff spot- won the national championshipStay salty, bro 
WHAT A PLAY. 42 yard pass from a 19 year old to win it
Are we completely sure Saban doesn;t have the nuclear codes
are you fuckin kiddin me
Georgia, home of the choke artists
Head up Georgia. You’ll be even better next year
God fucking damn it
GG, offense got handled in the 2nd half
Time since last Georgia Championship: 38 years. 
Congrats to Alabama, the 2018 co-champions
Which kid did Saban sacrifice for this one?
Georgia wtf
Lmao choke
If you’re complaining about the refs, you don’t give a shit about good football 
Underneath
just because they won doesn't mean another team wouldn't have
I hate Alabama but holy shit I gotta respect that play call and that ending. Wow 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5RtlpXsl8k
Pappaifuckingsuckatkicking got a huge break 
and they won, I'm the end it doesn't even matter of they failed this FG, god dammit
Anyone here really surprised?
Thank the refs on the way out bama for extending your drives. What a joke
Roll Tide and all, but they should have kept that Rammer Jammer in their pocket. 
Georgia sports teams and choking, name a more iconic duo.
Damn.
lmao just totally fucking trashed hurts
Good thing they let Bama into the playoffs /s
REF TIME!!!!
It was 20-7...
If this game didn't convince you that saban sold his soul to the devil to win I don't know what will.
I feel like I’m one with the majority of America in saying fuck alabama
You had one job Georgia. I wonder if Baker and Oklahoma could've beaten Bama.
Georgia’s secondary can go to hell. 
OMG the cannonSO MUCH SEPARATION FUCK
Wow, that was lazy defense by Georgia, game wasn’t over after the sack and you have to expect the big play after that they were like a cornered dog.  Congrats Bama!
Woooow
Herts to the draft
Darnold wouldn’t have it any other way
Sadly, the offense went into a shell as well
Im a Patriots fan that was rooting for Georgia. I'm starting to get the irrational hatred for us. 
The state of Georgia; The ultimate chokers 
Sure it was a great throw, but that defensive coverage was more blown up than Syria bro
OMG this live feed rn!!
So Bama is second to UCF now?
MODS POST THE POST GAME THREAD
I need to see that Camera man get leveled 
Happy for Bama but wow, what a game
Wow.....
STAHPPP
He seems okay with it.  Stand up guy
What the fuck did I just watch
Disrespectful of Saban not to recognize the contribution the refs made. 
4th Seed strikes again. 
Fuck
This ending makes me want to go punch a coach...
that was perhaps one of the greatest performances for a QB in cfb history
ROLL TIDE!!!!!there UGA fans, you can just be salty about not winning instead of "sharing" a titlelet the salty downvotes commence!
God what a choke. how did georgia let them get a 2nd and 26 td
Nick Saban’s autopsy will list his cause of death as “stress due to consistent failure of his field goal unit.”
My disappointment is immeasurable, and my day is ruined.
UCF won their NCG in regulation.  Just saying.
Fuck Bama anyway
BANANAS
HUMBLE YO SELF 
Georgia why :(
rip in peace
I can't believe this
Why do we play conference games again?
Are you kidding....
Holy shit. Hawaiian QBs OP
I mean he just dropped it right into his hands like what even
I hate Alabama but goddamn I am a Tua fan tonight.
God damn it, tomorrow will be insufferable!
No matter who you were pulling for, this was an incredible game.
how many virgins gotta die every year for this to happen
That’s a roll tide if I’ve ever seen one before.
Y’all can stay salty this was amazing 
Fucking end me 
UCF wins the natty
That was an incredible throw in that situation.
That throw was championship worthy 
And you said UCF should be in the playoffs 
Lol
Seriously, why weren't their safeties back? UGA made many questionable ass calls after the 4th. 
Tua - the overnight star
I just wanna know how the vikings can sign that fucking quarterback
That mofo channeled the power of Sexy Rexy, and went deep
WOW!
2nd and 26 and you can't keep anyone in front of you lol
Let the salt flow. Fuck this. 
Hey I wonder if any true freshmen played in this game
Congrats Bama, at least you earned it in OT. But for real, does the trophy spend some time at Bama and then go to the head ref's house? How does sharing the trophy work? Or are the refs just happy with their bribe?
maybe that sack was apart of the plan, can't air it out like that if you don't have the amount of yards to
Actually, Fuck auburn. I think we can all agree on that.
Fucking shitty kicker gets bailed the fuck out 
Saban needs to go to the fucking nfl
Can you imagine Nick Saban opening Christmas gifts
BRING ON THE SALT
GOAT voice crack
too gimmicky
The worst offensive play I've seen followed up by the worst defensive play 
Feel terrible for that corner to give a 41 harder on a 2nd & 26
Im done with college football. Why do coaches do the exact fucking opposite of what they should do? Lets run Nick Chubbs slow ass over and over meanwhile Michel is gashing Alabama. They deserved to lose.
What happened to Jalen Hurts that made them start the Freshman? Just got home from work.
Holy Crap Batman! They did it!
F
Im sorry, but Bama still didn't earn the right to be in the playoff. No one was doubting their talent, but they didn't earn the spot. They had it given to them. 
Georgia, you were the chosen ones...
And our win means absolutely nothing...way to go dawgs. I gotta suffer for another year now.
No, it's a justification for 8 teams. Under the current standards, they should not have been in, but with 8 teams, it is indisputable.
How can you type all that and still fap?
What a game!
I’m sorry Georgia.. hell of a team. GG 
That was awesome dude got trucked 
Alternate Champions. 
I can't believe there's no conflict of interest with this shit even with espn the damn sec channel
Tide didn't belong in this game..
Congrats UCF
[deleted]
GODDAMN WTF JUST HAPPENEDNick Saban went through all 5 stages of grief in like 20 seconds
I real life can't believe this right now 
Ggwp
AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Give me idfc
Clemson won last year.
Sorry man, maybe next year.
And people were saying this wasn't a good game 
FUCK
Or since last super bowl...
Tua has declared for NFL draft
The Bulldogs really wanted to be the Falcons huh?
When's the Bama-UCF game?
Lol how awkward was that reporter having no idea how to answer Saban asking if it was a good game. 
Georgia blew a 20-3 lead.
What a game
UGA you guys got robbed tonight. Hold your heads high, you guys went into overtime playing Bama and the refs. Hell of a performance and can't wait to see what you guys do next year.
THATS TRUE FRESHMAN DEVONTA SMITH TO YOU
That’s some legendary shit right there. 
Long overdue? They've won 5 in the last 10 years. 
What a game.
The curse of Georgia sports is alive and well
Sick pass from Tua, but let's be honest: the refs kept Bama in the game, there needs to be a legit investigation into the game, cuz that was fucked.
You of all people were rooting for bama?
Our Dark Lord Saban prevails again.
I GUESS THEY DID DESERVE TO BE THERE
... so that Mark Richt's fault?
BREAK THE INTERNET 
[deleted]
A new challenger approaches 
georgia was never going to win lol. If you've watched football for more than a year you know what i'm talking about. Every. Single. Call. went their way. 
Want to see that replay!
SERIOUSLY!!!!
3rd place in the SEC still.
If the Patriots win the super bowl I may just give up sports entirely. 
Tua Cardale now
What the actual fuck. Wow. I can't believe this game.Best playoffs to date, without question. Fuckin A.
Hawaii kid holy shit you’ve made a name for yourself for sure. 
Falcons-Falcons fan
Let's keep the band on 100 volume and put the interview at 50. 
Saban will celebrate now the only way he knows: by drinking half a cup of room temperature seltzer water 
College football is a fucking parody of what actual football should be.
Georgia fucking sucks, god damnit
TUA - THE FUCKING LEGEND!
Thread so fast I love penis cake!
I'm dying right now 
Weird how that happens
Sure would’ve been nice to see that game winning TD... thanks Espn 
Be like Tua. Take a sack far back, and then proceed to throw the championship game-winning touchdown in OT.
What is it with Georgia teams blowing leads and losing in OT in championship games?!?
Great weekend for Hawaiian QBs.
Ugh...
What a fucking dime
No, awkward would be if he asked what was in store for #48.
It's a decade at this point.
Congrats UCF#10 in the polls, #1 in our hearts
REEEEEEEEEEEE
Beating the Falcons at their own game in their own stadium 
kill me
This is the saltiest timeline
5/9 damn
It's over... Just like that...
BUT BUT BUT BAMA DOESN'T DESERVE TO BE IN THE PLAYOFFS 
With that QB?  Yeah, they'll def. be there for the next three...
Fuck EYBS. is no month safe for Mets fans?
Pappanasty thanking all the gods he didn’t have to go kick again. 
Fromm not even the best Freshmen QB in the game.
They just had to sneak in those last two "true freshmam"
Georgia lost this game with absolutely shit play calling in the second half.
It was Bama vs Georgia so they could save money on the confetti 
I hope the refs face some accountability for this. They caused a 10 point swing that would have basically ended the game early.
Please never let Parrish on a football field again
OF ALL THE FLAVORS IN THE WORLD, YOU CHOOSE SALTY!
Jalen Hurts is proof that Saban is dinosaur when it comes to offense.  
Gotta wonder if this even excites Saban anymore.
Congrats to the University of Central Florida
/r/CFB dies
Holy shit! Grats, Bama. Fuckers.
Sorry my reaction is so late I dropped and lost my phone when that shit happened.. WTF I THOUGHT IT WAS OVER AFTER THE SACK 
Kirby Smart has won another championship for BAMA.
this all turned because of three Bama benefited missed calls in 4 plays in the third:Blocked punt that was negated because of the incorrectly called offside (caused by non-called false start)Next play uncalled PI on Bama2 calls later uncalled personal foul on Bama.All in the favor of Bama. That series took a huge opportunity for UGA and effectively negated the series. Let alone the shocking number of poor calls in the last two series'.I understand the want of officials not to determine the winner, but you still have to officiate equally.
Sad confetti
It's a movie ending, this can't be real 
Nah that boi declaring for the draft. 
That black dude in the glasses cheesing behind Saban was hilarious lol
Who is this guy cheesing with saftety goggles?
Alabama fans are gonna forget about this in one week
ummmm can we see a fucking replay. how the fuck did he get so open...
Refs for MVP
Pruitt should take him to Tennessee with him. I'm kinda biased tho 
Hes been there. Didnt go great.
Why?
I knew it
GOD DAMNIT 
By God, that's UCF's music!
WE WANT UCF!!! 
Ahahaha what the fuck happened?  Hahahaha, man Football is something else.
Son of a bitch, Alabama's got an actual, bona fide quarterback now, don't they?
Georgia defense really lost this game.
that safety was just lost out there
Never ever bet against Bama, period.
That didnt last long. Roll Tide. That was a great game. But also Tua is an absolute God!
Nick Saban has no regard for PWT t-shirt budgets.  
as a stoke fan I fully support this
Right?? Having some superstar prodigy freshman QB come off the bench to lead them to a come-from-behind win while the other team crumbles... Sometimes I swear this shits scripted
We need to repeal and replace ol' Bama.
Georgia fans, don’t forget logics song 
UCF UCF UCF. The true champs this year. 
Great game, UCF.
Roll tiiide
Hey I predicted 27-23 Bama on Bowl pick on espn! I totally called that happening! Totally! I swear! I saw that coming! 
Wanted to keep em back there out of field goal range. I understand the decision but poorly done.
I’d believe it. So many non-calls
Mahalo Tua! 
Bama is a fucking dynasty, just wow
i hate bama but props to tagovailoa
i despise Bama but I can't wait to see Tua grow. The Lefty motion makes me so happy 
DeVonta Smith!!! Freshman to freshman!!!
Yep, somebody fucked up BIG TIME.
No one said he gets the entire state of North Carolina 
Really.??
Sports are just so painful and cruel sometimes.  Georgia sports most of the time. 
Georgia's offense went to the Kendrick Lamar concert instead of showing up for the second half
ill support Georgia until the end of time but goddamn it if i dont regret it
UCF UCF UCF
Poor.
I don't know what the state of Georgia did to piss off the football gods, absolutely gutting. You poor poor bastards
Lmao anyone see the person with the camera get run over in the endzone? 
Fuuuuck. I suck at picking games. Ofer in the CFP.   
Georgia fans deserve all the pain they are feeling right now. That's what you deserve for being a fan of fucking chokers. I hope y'all are Falcons fans too
he said "ill ask the questions" and then said "was that a good game or what?"then the announcer either didn't hear him or is a total fucking idiot and just stood there smiling
I can't believe you fuckers had a better option sitting there all year to bail you out in the NCG. Seriously what the hellYou still kick like shit
Happy cakeday
UCF is the one true champion!
Congrats to the SEC West runner up 
What a way to win it
ROLL FUCKING TIDE TUA!
C O L L A P S E . What's up with Georgia teams and choking?
Wow.
But did they win their conference?
give the trophy to the refs
Reporter instantly looks like he's never been asked such a tough question in his life
Literally don't let themGet a first down and your good
He tried once. 
Just want to say, WatchESPN is garbage, mobile and desktop.
Congrats UCF
So when does UCF and Bama play for the undisputed National Championship?
SHOW THE GODDAMN REPLAY
Where was the safety on that last play?!?!?!
oh man...
Bama depth is amazing.
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
Georgia, why?
well holy shit
Well shit
I love this Fucking team and I love tua. Fuck yes to everything!!!!!!
I think a couple.
Yeah but hell of a game
He sucked. 
That was a great game
Fuck me in the ass cause I love Jesus 
I AM SO SWEATY
[deleted]
OH MY GAWD ITS UCFOMGOMGOMGOMG RKO SCOTT FROST
I feel you.  I was surprised how hard I was cheering for Georgia. the FSU Auburn 'ship had a similar feel.  
THEY CANT KEEP GETTING AWAY WITH THIS
idk did you watch the super bowl!
A FUCKING FRESHMAN PLAYED HIS FIRST GAME IN THE NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP FOR HALF A GAME AND FUCKING PUSHED AND WON IT WHAT THE FUCK
ROLL TIDE!!!
This is why CFB is a joke
Awful hold on the play.... 
I just wanna let you know this comment hasn't been lost in the Tide
Well atleast we know Georgia will be out for blood next seaoson. But damn.
That Wallace kid was tagged in the third quarter and they kept throwing against him. Brutal.
You hate your own school
If its not the refs, its luck, if its not luck its so ridiculous play that work out
They earn their karma
I'm just saying. What about your resume warranted a playoff spot? Your best win was LSU, a team whose starting QB backed up at Purdue
According to a ton of people on here, the ref deserves it.
I’m glad there’s an off season. God damn. 5 in 9 years. Just fucking stupid
#notmychampion
What was the Georgia CB doing on that last play?!
Poor Goggles :(
Congrats Bama on winning the Auburn runner up bowl.
that was the most incredible game ive ever watched. 
#LONG LIVE TUA
A top tier team won two games in a row? Shocker..doesn't mean they deserve to be there 
At least we can have this one lol
Alabama = Crony Globalists 
God damn it Georgia, YOU HAD ONE FUCKING JOB.
I love Saban. He is too real.
Roll Tide
No. 
someone please make a Falcondog hybrid and post it
Yeah I was gona edit that but then I got lazy. 
Wow, congrats to Bama. Amazing finish. 
Man, 2nd and 40 you gotta cover the guy going deep.
"Bah Gawd.....that's UCF's music!"
He tried that and it didn't go too well
no I will never stop bitching about that bullshit punt 
Hey, maybe you guys should play during the regular season...
Fuck all the haters in here Roll Mother Fucking Tide
He already was...
thank your tissue paper for cleaning up your tears!!!!!
someone please make a Falcondawg hybrid and post it
STILL UNDEFEATED IN THIS BAMA POLO!!!!!!!
UFC UFC UFC 
Good game Georgia. I know you hate us and all, but I'll always love Kirby.Edit: I'm sorry for paying y'all a compliment.
They shouldn't.  What's your point?
Who's 28-3??
jfc
Aaaaand I'm back to hating football. Worst outcome of all.
Literally the ONLY thing Georgia couldn't allow to happen was to let a guy get over the top.  And their offensive coordinator should be cleaning out his office tomorrow.Insane choke job in all areas.  Woof.Props to that Bama freshman QB.  Big time debut.
I hope the interviewer mentions #48
Definitely can not keep Tua out after that
Gimme that 8 team playoff
undeserved? you are ridiculous 
Hahahaaa 16 yard sack and then he wins it on a Cardale pass. GG everyone, that was one heck of a ride. Congrats Alabama.
Its scary how much of a perfectionist Nick Saban is
28-3, 20-3 What fucking next
[deleted]
AAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!NICK SABAN > BEAR BRYANT
Don’t be gross
At the end of the day, Superman Goggles still has the biggest sack out there. 
I can't wait to watch Georgia fans breaking tvs on YouTube tomorrow
Lol, and he was cocking off on the drive where Bama scored the tying touchdown when an Alabama receiver just dropped the ball.  14 didn't even do anything, but he celebrated anyway.  I love it.
First question I would have asked would be, "why did you let 48 back in after he hit an opposing player and a coach?"
Bet the over at 45.5.  I was a loser for 99.9% of the game. 
I wanna die.
As an Alabama fan, do you even enjoy this anymore? 
FUCK YES TUA I'LL HAVE YOUR BABIES
there are other sports
I CAN TASTE IT ALREADY
I gotta hand it to them.  Well played.Congrats UCF!
Wow leave a dude wide open deep on 2nd and 26. How does that even happen.
Darkest timeline. RIP Georgia bros RIP cfb. No point coming to r/cfb for months. FUCK Alabama 
The darkest timeline.
Can we just move all Georgia teams to another state to prevent this shit from happening?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOzXRpLD-XU
Its a dark world we live in
Doesn't need them. I think he's got the reality gem in his ass somewhere.
Time since last pro Alabama ref job : today 
Can we all agree that since Bama won, UCF is the real champion?
I have never seen Saban happy...Weed before game confirmed.
I hope the refs at least took Georgia out to a nice dinner before they fucked them. 
make sure that nissan commercial is at 10000 though
LET YOUR SALT POUR
Tua took that sack on purpose so he could make that bomb tbrow, obv. 
Salt
Why win your division when you can walk into the natty with an extra week of rest!Also congrats to UCF on their national championship 
Georgia will be back.
Tua took that game and fucking won it.  MVP. 2018 starter. Heisman contender.
Who else is moved by Saban's emotion?
FIRST THE FALCONS NOW THIS LOLOLOLOL FUCK GEORGIA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
FUCKGEORGIA
Nick Saban seems like a decent guy. 
Gather round, children, and hear the Legend of Tua Time.
Man got BURNT!
That UGA corner just dropped 4 rounds in the draft
Well we never let Auburn forget it.
how's that bowl game been treating you guys this season?
By God, that's UCF's music!
hats off, coach made a choice to go with a 19 yr old and he fuckin did , kid fuckin did it.
Tua needed the sack to throw the deep ball.
SABAN IS A GOD.
I was gone for a minute but I'm back now..
Got benched at halftime.
Don't let that distract you from the fact that Georgia blew a 13 point lead at half.
Chokela-georgia?
How the hell do you let a WR get behind you on 2nd and long? What a terrible defensive play call.
OMFG THIS SHIT IS INSANE
HOLY SHIT 
Too obvious that was gonna happenWhat a shitshow
Another bowl loss for the SEC this year. 
Fuck the refs
Boo
 https://i.imgur.com/6G4dpH4.jpg 
Saban pretending to have emotions..
Holy shit what a game
Two fucking chokes in a row, I can't even imagine Georgia right now.
Out of curiosity, whose refs were these?
Well that's Tuafying
NOT MY CHAMPION
Lol. Means a lot coming from fucking Nebraska
Nick Saban is choking up.
how did he get so open?  i'd love to see a replay.
I mean how the fuck do you let that happen?
Fuck you Georgia I hope you never win another game! Letting Saban and Belichick win like that. Screw that state!
I feel dirty.
And Georgia completely blew the coverage. What the fuck was the god damn safety at
Is it really even fun for Bama anymore?
I thought he looked happy after one national title, but then again I can't find the picture.
Well looking forward to next year. Let down of a year but oh well. Bama gets to enjoy another natty. Even if they didn’t win their division or conference... SMH. My butthole is ready for your downvote on slaughter bring it on. 
Tua gave us a "lil" spark lol
What a god damn dime that was. Good lord. 
Nick Saban... respek
Great game, Georgia.  Sorry our players were dicks.
But these refs don't know what holding is
Not at all. It was actually a fun game to watch if you aren't bothered by obvious officiating bias.
The ass stadium is cursed for all Georgia teams
TOM RINALDI SHUT THE FUCK UP
Let's go in hiding. Bama got a good QB now. 
I need a trash bag to vomit 
Don't act like you didn't see it coming.
Flair doesn’t check out. 
college football has less parity than the nba
Well, I suppose I have to say Saban is the best of all time now.
There is no god
What a joke, tired of Bama being gifted everything. They played average the whole game and it's all gifted to them.
Just a true sophomore that lead you to 2 consecutive title games and is #2 all time in TDs in your school's history.Yea, fuck him.
I cannot believe Georgia let em get over the top. holy shit
I don’t care how much we hate Bama, the rammer jammer is one of the coolest traditions in cfb. 
The Non-Conference Champion Champion!
Inbreds win again.
Saban tries to crack a joke and gets silence.  That was real awkward lol.  
Wow, just wow.
That...was never the score.
Flair up!
The state of Georgia and choking away leads in championship games.Name a more iconic duo.
Nice to see a new champion in CFB#UCF
Gorgia gonna Gorgia
I’d like to congratulate the B1G officiating crew and UCF on splitting the National Title. Well deserved!!
bAma doEsnT beLoNG IN the ColLeGe foOtbAll plAyOff
[deleted]
That’ll be kinda hard since Georgia was never up 20-3 at any point of the game
It'll be renamed Tuascaloosa
They don't know what holding is though.
Same thing, IMO, with Ohio State a few years ago.
Damn, that has to be the lowest feeling to the highest feeling within 15 seconds 
Richt is smirking
[r/cfb right now](https://res.cloudinary.com/teepublic/image/private/s--wEcCgELe--/t_Preview/b_rgb:191919,c_limit,f_jpg,h_630,q_90,w_630/v1488119210/production/designs/1268384_1.jpg)
I’m already salivating playing with Tua in Madden lol 
I'm glad I witnessed this
The state of Georgia is cursed.  
Rank em: Falcons, Dawgs, Georgia Dome
Tua is Jesus.
Way to go refs, you earned it!
Why would the National Champion play the Peach Bowl Champion?
Now go back and read the 3rd quarter thread for lols
GG Bama. Tua is a hell of a QB and you guys outplayed us in the second half. The Dark Lord reigns supreme again.
Well Georgia covered, that’s what matters most (to me). 
gg
Well they wear the same colors
Blowing a lead: Just Georgia sports team things. 
Alabama is the luckiest college football team of all time. Literally a perfect storm every season. Makes no sense
Good job Georgia. 
Ohhh it does!
Harsh
Saban could get elected to US Senate right now
DONT LET THE FACT THAT GEORGIA BLEW A 20-7 LEAD DISTRACT YOU FROM THE FACT THAT THE FALCONS BLEW A 28-3 LEAD IN THE SUPER BOWL
you'll never top that Nick. Retire please
It gives taste to fine cuts of meat. 
CAVS 2018 NBA CHAMPS CONFIRMED 
At least UCF won a national championship. I'm so sorry, Georgia.
They can’t just let the underdogs win can they? Ughhhhh
Oh my god the salt in here. Jesus Christ some pathetic fools. Bama earned it. 
FUCK BAMA AND FUCK THESE REFS
lol
Accurate LOL
Bias alert: 3rd best National Champ game I've ever watched    Amazing goddamn game
Bama would lose to osu i will never let this go. 2 teams is a joke. 
he sucks
Shout out to Blankenship anyway
The sack was all planned Saban = Big Brain 
That's me in the spotlight
Nebraska flair lol
Since this will get buried: I’m going to go violently masturbate
No replay of the last play?
One job, don't let the receiver get behind you.
No a bunch of refs wrote an article saying why they were right lol. There was no DPI 
Superbowl loss last year biggest game in CFB and Georgia loses. I literally want to fucking kill myself so bad. This state fucking sucks absolute dick at sports my heart can’t take this holy fuck
Damn that tasted good. 
How unbelievably satisfying
Screw the kids.  Never been happier
Never. UCF beat the team who beat Bama. They’re the real champs
grats dude, happy for you guys.
Well, let’s all just agree to completely forget this season even existed!! 
Nick Saban is about to have a fucking heart attack 
No kidding. I can’t believe what I saw out of Georgia after about halfway through the third. On defense, sure, you can’t hold forever, but what the flying fuck was that playcalling.
Oh, stop.  It's always going to be something. 
Saban tries to be cool for the first time ever and the sideline reporter fucked it up. His face when the sideline reporter ignored his question
Guys... Guys.... If you look closely enough you can see the horns
Saban emotional. That says a whole lot.
The entire state?!
If I'm that safety or cb (whoever messed up) I'm sick. I'm in the locker room throwing up. Holy shit, I feel so bad for them. 
What a colossal defensive meltdown 
Don't let Georgia blowing a 10 point lead in the 4th Quarter of the National Championship distract you from the fact that Michigan blew a 19 point lead in the Outback Bowl!
They were too busy fucking celebrating to get set.
and OT
How do you let that happen if you're Georgia. 2nd and forever in OT and they allow a long td pass. 
Confirmed: No gods exist.
2nd & 26.. how does someone get behind the secondary? 
Tua looks young as fuck. 
Exactly. It being in OT is enough for this year, but if Bama is back again next year... 
I blame Ohio State
Phew! Nice work bama
Punk ass Bama players get rewarded again. 
How do you just let him blow right by? 
HowMany times can I be let down in my life
hahahahahahahahahahahhahahah
Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
3/8 for 21 yards
*sigh* Dilly dilly
Great win for the program.  'Bama should finally start getting some respect.
Where were you when Jalen Hurts's starting job died?
UCF, one true Champ  
*Atlanta burns while Sherman laughs maniacally*
GG bama.  I am still proud to be a ha Bulldawg 
[deleted]
lol at "when did you find out you were going in?""well, I was taking a shit and..."
oh shit hes retiring soon... in 5 years
That’s true
National champion didn't win it's division within it's conference..didn't win it's conference either. College football is an utter joke in it's current playoff format.
UGA could've used our OT help
Lol. He said he's never been happier.
Good for Tua. Day 1 starter for Bama next year. Dude, that last play though. Someone screwed up
Congrats UCF!
So who is the real SEC champ?
Saban is cold blooded AF
As a Georgia pro sports fan it sucks. And UGA couldn’t pull it off and beat effing bama. Ugh 
When?
Well...uh this is awkward
Fuck. Alabama. 
Dont know who i hate more. Alabama, Georgia, or the CFP.
Now THAT was the most georgia way to lose a game
God he sucks
wasn't playing well and benched.  He wasn't injured.
THIS IS THE BEST COLLEGE FOOTBALL GAME SINCE THE 2017 ROSE BOWL 
I fucking hate you, Alabama, with all of my heart.But God damn do I respect you. 
Nick Saban saying he's never been happier in his life made me smile. I sometimes forget he's an actual person. Congrats Bama.
I guess, maybe...in the words of King KendrickGeorgia, be humble.
holy shit
Less than 3 hours left until a new day. 
A bunch of 19 year old stars
Did you miss the Georgia and Oklahoma game?
When Lubbock, Texas is saying this you **know** it's bad.
What is it with teams from Georgia and choking in the championship?
Hey, at least now that Bama won, UCF has a legitimate claim to a Natty
CONGRATS UCF!
not my champions #UCF
UCF is now #1 in the Colley Matrix and Wolfe rankings, meaning they now have a legitimate National Championship claim! Roll Tide!
he's already been there
Probably instructed to keep it close to keep that money coming in from the commercials.
One of the best National Championship Game though!!!
I feel REALLY bad for Jalen
Congrats Referees. 
[I understand your hate, but--](http://m.quickmeme.com/img/00/0055181c69e03d0775d5bf464b6b84617c377c507cb6df31964fb994ce00e49a.jpg)
Freak 
K. Roll Tide tho
We cannot talk.
Our sports curse continues. D:
How about them Knights? Saben is scared Alabama won't be #1. First thing out of his mouth is "wasn't that a great game"
We deserve that.
Refs for MVP
One thing that does stand out to me is how Georgia is responding. Holding their heads high on a great season.Well done, guys!
I cant...
The real important stat from this game
Can't spell Tuscaloosa without Tua
Fuck is? Fuck the refs
Well CFL could use some excitement 
I wouldn't mind having those refs on my payroll, either, Saban.
Roll tide!
For real! And it's not even this game, I tried watching a bullshit D2 game on it before and lagged like fucking hell. 
HEY SAME...oops caps was still on
Dude, if you can't appreciate what just happened then I don't know what to tell you. Find a new sport. 
That is true.
BULLDOZE THE BENZ.  THE CURSE LIVES.
Congratulations to UCF, undefeated, won their conference and the national championship!
As someone who doesn't really follow CFB, Where does that ending rank for championships games?  That was a beautiful fucking throw.   
Choking hazard on the stadium please.
Bamaboozled 
They were big 10 I believe
Georgia is cursed as a state dude. Braves. Hawks. Thrashers. Falcons. Bulldogs.
Fuck you Mark for not recruiting the kid. GG Bama.
Use lube
What happens in Alabama stays in the family. Roll Tide!
Tua looked right all play, until the last second - great lookoff to force the safety's late reaction
B1G
Yours
Nick Saban on Christmas: "This was fine"
He may be a national champ QB as a true freshman, but his hair fucking sucks lol
I don’t want to hear from Saban right now 
But muh Jesus 
Upvotes to keep it at the top
Falcons played in Georgia dome last year. 
SEC teams are bad at playing backup QBs in the CFB playoff. We have found their weakness.
They were not supposed to be in the playoffs! Ffs!!
Saban could bring peace to the middle east if someone made a trophy for it to give to him 
Jot that down!
Played like ass
Sounds like an ESPN 30 for 30
With a gigantic smile across my face, that's how!
Man to do after a 16 yard sack, what a man.
Invoking Jesus
Thank my Lord and Savior 
Hats off to Georgia. I expect them back next year if it's not Bama. 
Sabans personal squad

Jesus Christ. What a finish. 
IS JESUS THE NAME OF THE REFEREE?
Asking the important questions
Fuck 
Yeah we kick like shit...but we win nattys. A bunch of em.
Actually insane holy fuck. The balls of that play call, the balls of that throw by the freshman. Wow 
G20rg3a
just an unimpressive first half. Most of his offense was scrambling.
Oh yeah *so* happy for Bama fans, been a rough two years since their last title...
Good for Tua.
#We Want UCF
Come on man get the dig on the right school at least.
Thanks for another great year CFB
Red wedding.
Incredible that you can come in third in your conference, not compete for your conference championship, and play in and win the national championship
Oh boy, he's a Christian. Sorry reddit!
THANK U JESUS
tOSU should've been in the playoffs 
Go ahead and fire up that asterisks for that Natty *UCF
B1G, if I heard correctly
Saben is stone cold. Pulls a 2 year starting qb and then the backup wins it.  
Saban getting emotional, incoming retirement???More at 11
Either he's human, or he got a huge hardware upgrade!
I can't believe you've done this Georgia 
UGA better fore that DB, fucker wasn’t even running
Congratulations to the b1g refs, 2017 national champions!
That..was...insane 
Roll Tide
And this https://twitter.com/jimmytraina/status/950589387770916870
I mean you needed the refs to gift you every call to have a shot
this fella is so wholesome
you should be thanking the devil son
Wow, that was quick. And YESSSSS!!! UCF CAN BE CO-CHAMPS!
This is the only reality I can survive in
Wait, Tua can speak English??
I don't hate you Bama fans but fuck Alabama
...yeah, sure, why not?
subscribe
They're a bit complicated... and I guess no longer relevant. 
Fresh pineapple boi
Alabama earned the shit out of this, hate all the fuck you want.
Seems like Tua has picked up on English pretty quick
I'm not really upset about this one.
UCF! UCF! UCF! 
Georgia Fans, this number is open 24/7...1-800-273-8255
No, his voice is just gone from yelling for 3 hours straight.
He's like a mini Mariota!

Can't wait to watch the Chiefs, Bills, Panthers and Rams in the playoffs next week!
Clearly expecting coverage over the top. 
Lol gtfo sorry ass team
If it was a false start it still wouldn't have counted as a blocked punt...
What a weirdly aggressive take. Have fun being an asshole
I promise you, Jesus does not care who wins the football game. 
Yea they rotated him in to sack himself.
JESUS MUST BE THE REFEREES NAME GUYS
I mean.... You kind of aren't wrong
Refs let Bama bully Georgia's QB, who promptly folded like a bitch.
Looked more like a cover 0
Tua Tebow
I hate bama, always root against them. But man, I love this kid fromhawaii
Usually I'm no fan of prevent. But there's like one job at that point...
You guys played a hell of a game and have the talent to bounce right back. GG georgia will be back :)

He sucks.
True, but 6 out of 9 years...
the good ol Jesus ad
Putting an asterisk next to this one for Alabama.*Didn't play a conference championship game, didn't win their division, played two fewer P5 opponents than Georgia (and Clemson and OU) , and got an extra week to rest and research. Congrats on the Natty UCF!
Holy shit what a pass 
Great game , jesus christ.Roll Tide Roll.

I saw it!
Yeah, would it kill them to play 2 safeties up top and play zone?
On behalf of the B1G, I apologize that you got stuck with our refs.
Hurr durr 
Why the fuck would his parents be upset about him thanking Jesus, lol

can't prepare fore what you don't have film on. Its the Cardale move

Oh man. That reminded me of Tebow.
I like this guy
THERE IS NO GOD 
I believe B1G
San Francisco 49ers don't agree with that.
How many coaches/scouts/ADs do you think call Jalen Hurts tonight?
Hello darkness my old friend
No sense in crying now, just on to the next season. Great game that with better officiating would've likely gone UGAs way.Saban's one of the undisputed best though. I can hate Bama, but not him.
Big ten
Why you gotta be like that man? We're just as disappointed as you are :(
Didn’t get to see the game winning play. SHOUT OUT TO WATCH ESPN FFS
Literally DGAF cause now this means UCF can claim their NC via Colley, right?
Welcome to our misery. 
Congrats to runners up Alabama
Fuck Bama but I like this QB kid. Well spoken. Seems like he has a good head on his shoulders. Hope Saban doesn’t sell his soul to the devil. 
Tua didn't start... these shitty anchors.
Tua acting like he won a preseason scrimmage
Dude right? Wtf! I want to see if it was that trash can #14's dudeEdit: IT WAS HOLY FUCK
We just watched OU lose by playing not to lose, so what do we do? Ugh. Our seniors deserved better than this.
Watching like the rest of us.
They saved a lot of money on confetti tonight. Just got red/white for either team.
And the State of Georgia sports curse continues. 
we can always get let down next year bro
High 5 buddy 
Lol if OU would have won you wouldn't be saying that. Typical gooner fan lol
I was thinking to myself that the next play would be dangerous because the players are going to be hyped and taking a shot down the field would be possible. Has anyone analyzed the play? It seemed like there is no way a player should have been that wide open. Blown coverage for sure. Why wasn't there help? 
That TD covered the spread and the over. #fuckmyass
Best of luck
Someone should sneeze on him.
[deleted]
He knows he's getting paid. 
That was the happiest interview I have ever seen from him. 
Yo bitch, need some popcorn to go with all that salt? 
Hate to fucking say it, but Saban is the greatest CFB coach of all time.
Qb did a great job holding the safety off there. Probs should have been higher, but fantastic play
I wanna see an interview with the kicker.
UCF > Auburn > Bama. Math checks out 
Well, it was 20-7 and Alabama made tons of mistakes. That was GA’s game to lose.
No no, they were one of the 4 best..... who cares what they're record is/was
This dude is 16 and just iced a huge championship
Level this stadium too!
HUMBLE YOURSELF!
Justice for Richt, I love it
What did you drink in OT? 
See Alabama,  good karma comes your way when you don't elect molesters .

Yup, the B1G gets more money from Alabama winning. 
Don’t let this distract you from the fact that Georgia is still the reigning SEC champs. 
##NOTMYCHAMPIONS
SCOREBOARD
Georgia, at least you won the classy and not dirty competition. Doesnt mean much, but you still got that!
THE HUMBLE HAWAIIAN CARRIES THE GAME AS IT SHOULD BE.  JALEN BENCHED AND WE WON, WHO WOULD HAVE GUESSED.
Lol real talk
Hes 18 cut him some slack
Punk ass OSU players don’t make it once again 
Pretty much everyone was rooting for Georgia though.
I mean that was awesome. But I wanted like a quad overtime.
Overtime was the red wedding. So much hope going into overtime.
The Falcons better fucking win this weekend. 
Jesus for the win 
UCF > Auburn > Bama. Math checks out 
B1G
he's the opposite of the Rammer Jammer song
bama’s championship drought is finally over
Alright Saban. Go out on top 
I knew it!  It was Jesus' fault!
Georgia completely choked in the second half, kind of fascinating to see them fall apart like that. 
Falcons, Dome, Dawgs
I would trust Bama 63 to hold me off the top of the empire state building.
Georgia, I can't believe you done this.
I started watching in the 3rd quarter when Tua came in and then Alabama just started rolling wtf goddamit Georgia
We didn't need overtime to win in that stadium. 
Happy Cakeday!
I like that he apologized before thanking God. That was so sweet
Wife just left me, probably about to get fired but none of that matters right now. Craziest game ever 
Please retire now
Congrats Bama. What a fucking dynasty 
this fucking qb is russell wilson 2.0 right down to the fucking bible talk bullshit. amazing.
One on one, where the fuck was the safety?
"Earned it"
Lol now let’s listen to how much Reddit doesn’t like Christians. Let the guy have his moment.
I didn’t even get to see the last play thanks to this shitty ass espn stream
Alabama things
Parents hate Jesus confirmed 
And the dark lord wins again.
Big 10. They said so at the beginning of the game. 
Extra drama
Russell Wilson II
Not scoring in the first half. Not being able to run against Georgia 
It just means more
See now you know I was right when I said in previous threads if you Tua in you'll win this game :)
Saban seemed actually human for once in that interview 
No deep safeties? Dumb call. 
Listen to that freshman, he sounds a little familiar....
true freshmen qb to true freshman wr game winning td?
I think he would have. He doesn't do tricks. Oh well - we'll never know.
Freshman quarterback has not been trained on talking to the media.
Why did he apologize to his parents before thanking Jesus? Do his parents hate Christianity or something?
What
Good
Both of these teams are somehow going to be better next year.  Holy shit.
First of all, through God all things are possible, so jot that down
UGA's DBs will be crucified back in Athens
Was wondering the same thing.
this kid still hasnt even hit puberty yet.
Give the glory to the referees Looooooool
If I was a Georgia fan I'd never get over this. Never.
Well, I guess the college committee looks like geniuses, although who knows how Ohio State or UCF would have fared 
georgia sports intensifies
RIP to the state of Georgia 
Tua has said "you know" about 15 times in this post game interview
Dude was wide open.  Nothing special, Georgia blew the coverage
Worse Georgia collapse?  2017 Falcons  or  2018 Bulldogs
So humble
DAMNIT I TOOK THE OVER THAT HE WOULDN'T MENTION JESUS UNTIL 2 MINUTES INTO HIS INTERVIEW!
Aww man I love that Tua kidstill# #NOTMYCHAMPS
Hot take
but but but resume
That Corner got burned bad and he thought he had safely help. 
*shhh you never saw anything*
Russell Wilson
Don’t people get tired of watching the same teams win nearly every year? Happens in almost every sport except baseball and NCAAB. It’s exhausting and boring.
Cringeeee
[removed]
The state of Georgia is forever going to be cursed as the worst sporting state.
Someone piss test Saban. He has to be on the drug from Limitless or something
I like this kid. 
Yeah i momentarily forgot about the 28-3
FUCKKKKK RAWR 
The drought continues! 
what was that about apologizing to his parents?
It continues, I guess. It was up to these guys to exorcise it
They helped bama shank two field goals? Lol
who hurt you
So 2 national championships for Saban when he didn't win his conference..
I'm just proud he learned to speak English in such a short amount of time at Bama.
There is no better drama in sports than the long CFB FGs in meaningful games!
Great game. 
That’s our secret Hawaiian power. Youth runs in our blood.
Thanking Jesus when you play for Satan himself.
oh christ. stfu freshman. 
I just woke my daughter, broke my headphones and pissed off my wife. BUT WE WON IT AGAIN BABY LET THE HATERS HATE ANOTHER YEAR!!!!!!!!!!
Refs
An Alabama win. 
All things are possible through our Lord and savior Jesus Christ 
Tua says otherwise
Subscribe
Awesome game 
Just go with it.  
Fuck bama, it gets old seeing the same fucking team win every year. It's like cavs-warriors or the patriots, i wanna see the love spread around
Why does the state of Georgia hate the rest of the country? Letting the patriots and bama keep their dynasty’s going while you could be building your own
The Polynesian Tide Rolls
Move over Jalen Hurts. This dude looks legit.
Tua the Hawaiian-Bama Freshy LEGEND.
tua's gonna be a stud
jawja spots
... I'm done
Upset that it wasn’t the first thing he said lol
HAIL SABAN!
Someone call Logan Paul, bout to be a whole forest of hangins
Lmfao it's always funny to me when the players say they thank Jesus As if the Georgia players weren't begging Jesus either
I may have cried a little. Great way to introduce my fiance to the craziness of college football. 
I knew that back in 09
NaCl
too late
Congrats UCF!
Holy shit. What a game 
Seems like a good kid. He definitely earned it. Is he like 5 feet tall though?
Thank you Jesus for not caring about starving children but the ol foosball
Despite the Jesus nonsense, Tua seems like a good dude.Edit: nice, getting downvoted because I think it's nonsense that Jesus gives a fuck about 'Bama football. K.
Best image in this thread! Pack it up boys!Edit: Happy Cake Day!
Dilly Dilly!
I still don't think they should. It's bullshit that a team can not even play in a conference championship but be national champs. Thats twice they've beaten an SEC team in the Natty by basically getting a bye while the other faces elimination in their conf championship 
Ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Anyone have a gif or webm of the game winning play?
How the fuck did 48 continue to play??
Tau is so likable I almost forgot he plays for Satan incarnate. 
Next season poll1. God2. Alabama
And THIS is why we love college football
Welp that quarterback is a total tool. Didn’t mind him until that interview. 
he did his job, that's for sure
Bleach
Tua seems like a good kid.  Hurts, too.  Now get rid of 48.
But in wholesome points Beamer is still #1
And *still* beat the number one ranked team. Damn. 
BAMA DOESNT HOLD.
Jesus loves Bama best, confirmed.
Alabama's
Mediocre play. Nothing major just came out and played real flat
I thought he was from Hawaii?
i have no idea what that is
WWJD if sacked for a 15 yard loss?
Big congratulations to Bama for winning that second-place Trophy! Silver is great, too!
All right, Tua, quit the god talk.Having Jameis Winston Nam flashbacks.
Deserve to play in, even
You didn't, paid the committee and paid the refs. Worst officiating I've seen in a long time. Genuine mistakes on our part too, but that was a bullshit game. I wouldn't be proud if my guys played as dirty as yours, either.
Reminds me of Russell Wilson
What about them?
They found a way.
Yeah! Fuck people who support their hometown teams! What losers! 
Refreshes at the right time to catch you. Doesn't mean I'm going to stop you though.
Patriots v Raiders tuck rule 
Second 4th seed to win the title game. The playoff system is an improvement.
I demand an Alabama-UCF game for all the marbles.  Or just an exhibition game.  It'd be amusing either way.
CFP is fuckedClaim away UCF, you could have competed with either of these teams tonight.
Lol
Why would his parents get mad about him thanking Jesus lol
Was this ever in question?
But congraTulations to Alabama for being the 2018 National Champions. 
>My parents would hate me saying this but I have to thank my lord and savior Jesus ChristLMAO 
I can't handle more Alabama shittalking. GG
Must not be very religious people
Doeeet
We've always needed kickers for some damn reason
The next Tim Tebow.
Plz stop the god talk. 
His parents may be vehemently atheistic
GG Georgia.  Now I think I’m going to go lay down and die from stress 
FUCK ALABAMA
ROLL MOTHER FUCKING TIDE!!!!!
Is this a football game or a mega church sermon 
RB - Alabama 
...Jot that down
Seconded. 
blame jesus
UCF is the true heir to the FBS throne
FUCK BAMA
This QB is like, meh, whatever just won the natty nbd
Okay. So we run it back next week right? This negates Georgia's conference title and now we play one more winner take all.
Shut the hell up and let the man celebrate with his team
Gotta get those brownie points just in case
He's in WitSec
Falcons would like to thank the Dawgs for taking the Choke Mantle
Tbf hardcore recruiting guys knew about him.
I don't. I used to, but their dirty hits and the fact that 48 came back after that shit on the sidelines takes away my respect. They might earn it back, but fuck Bama tonight.
Top 5
?
Congrats to the Big Ten referees on their national championship. 
Kid played great but doesn't Tua kinda throw weird?
I remember now why I don't get in to college football. This games officiating was truly horrid.
Wait I thought Bama freshmen weren't allowed to
The real conspiracy.
B1G
Dilfer tried to warn you
Did you know that guy was a true freshman?
y'know? y'know? y'know?
It's hard to believe but damn. They both will be back for SEC title I feel.
Tua be like ["Y'all mind if I praise God?"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJgjhl1jbp8)
God for once I just want a candid, raw response from these players. Bama qb is saying the most generic shit. YOU JUST THREW A WINNING TD PASS IN OT FOR THE SHIP, GET A LIL HYPE 
Lol that made me laugh
Gotta dial it in, bruh.
These interviews are shit
"I wanna thank Jesus Christ for this one, all things possible with him, he was definitely with me, not the Christians on the other team, because screw them right"
Yeah Wtf?why is there no replay
Oof ouch owie
Calm down Tebow Jr.
Maybe not, but he does care about people.
He said a lot of weird shit. He started it with " well fellas, the game is over but we still don't have a champion. Lets see who its gonna be" or something like that lmao 
Reporters all up in players’ faces with the mike immediately after the game ends. Damn, give them a few to enjoy/process what happened. 
But would they lose by 31 to Iowa?
Jesus was a true freshman
Channeling Tebow
Fuck I hate when they do the "first and foremost, I couldn't do this without God" shit.
And have an extra bye week as a result 
All Hail UCF - The rest are fakes
UGA didn’t lose this game and Bama didn’t win this game. Refs did both. So many missed calls. So many blown calls. Anyone in their right mind could see we weren’t offsides on that punt block. Would’ve easily been a touchdown after. Fuck Bama. Fuck Saban. And fuck anyone who thinks the refs weren’t clearly bias. 
Just Alabama things.
*holds*
Thats the second time too. The play on the sack he was wide open just like that. No idea why.
Meh... AP should just vote for UCF. They beat Auburn. 
Man, football in Georgia must be like repeatedly getting the panties off of a supermodel and not being able to ever get it up.
[removed]
Not sure but i think he loves god
Better than 90% of my friends too
God dammit Dawgs.. put my faith in y'all..
You're gonna be dealing with Tua, the guy who caught the ball, and Harris for the next two years. enjoy.
Tua is thanking the wrong God. 
Omg, fucking take credit for your win. God didnt do shit for you, you put in all the work and sweat and tears, you own that shit.
The officiating sucked but what the hell were Georgia's coaches calling in the 4th quarter and beyond. 
If Jesus scores touchdowns, why does Notre Dame still suck?
Hahahah I thought that too
Wilson clone confirmed?
It wasn’t Jesus it was your evolutionarily given talent. Fuck
His didn't thanked Jesus before his parents.
I mean at least they fuckin
Tua is gonna get LAID
sorry but not ur kind of Christian tho...
through his lord and savior all things can fucking suck
Bro you seriously have a problem, it can't be emotionally healthy to comment like this ranting about the refs every 20 seconds
B1G! B1G! B1G! B1G! 
He's from Hawaii. 
Aww Jalen :(
2017 Falcons, and it isn't even close.
The dynasty.
He's Hawaiian.Witcha dumbass
He stopped running
I saw it on replay 3 times. I still don't believe it. WOW. What a finish. 
Ughhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Thank you, Jesus. Thank you for letting kids starve but give me a good arm to throw a pigskin. 
46 yard handoff to win it all in OT. Tua is a beast. 
That was a pretty godly performance though like how the fuck do you do that
Tua wanted to come to Oregon and Helf wouldn't recruit him. Oregon fans on suicide watch
Well it appears the devil did go down to Georgia after all.
As a partial Native Hawaiian, that this glorious Hawaiian man is praising Christ is sad and offensive. (/s)
Agreed
Co? We out right. Bring it Bama
No, they can't. Bama is the lone National Champion. 
Hate that I'm right but I said Tua is your guy to win this game 
Hmmm...lets try to run outside with Chubb instead of Michel....that seems like a good plan smfh. I'm done with sports from GA man...they have betrayed me far too many times.
RIP Yellow hummer tv guy.
Lol football cliches one after another 
Georgia has a title coming soon though. Kirby's doing it right down there
Seattle will take him! =P
Offense couldn't get anything going during the first half
JESUS SAVES! 
Enjoy the salt baby! Enjoy that second place trophy 
He's Russell Wilson in every way after that interview
Hahahha
[deleted]
Hardcore agnostics
They still don't but don't let the shit officiating get in the way of your circle jerk.
WTF did Georgia do to deserve this karma.
All Glory to God # 13 Marino Cunningham is gonna be alright. 
Got em!
Man, Jalen is awesome.
Saban, for the love of all that is holy, please retire. I cannot handle your teams anymore.
God shut up. You got beat, sucks but thats what happened. Game should've never went to overtime. Even in overtime your kicker hit a 51 yard field goal let that sink in.
Not thanking god as his first statement. 
Fixed it
Infinite salt all throughout. That's fine. That was an incredible game. Thanks, UGA, for providing the most stressful NCG in recent memory. What a comeback. What a game. Rammer Jammer & Roll Tide. 
Jesus is the name of the referee.
I cringe every time someone says “all credit to god” 
Was it though?
What a brutal game, there was so much unflagged holding, pushing, and some punching
Can we tone down the Jesus juice 
Imagining him open boxes full of 4/5 star recruits is a bit odd, but it does explain how he gets so many.
Love hearing Tua praise God, right on brother 
I'm not sure which way your salt comment is going....
Isn't he 18?  
Judging by Sabans reaction, I'd say no 
Poor jalen
Congrats to Alabama for finishing second in the national championship race. Congrats also to watchESPN for their outstanding game of buffering and commercials. Congrats to #48 for a certain, prosperous career in the NFL.
Jesus Christ must've been on the ref crew.
Oooooh, animated banner, fancy.
TRUE GOD FRESHMAN 
So is Nick. 
I was just saying *Don't let them get behind you.*Oops.
As much as this might suck. Falcons by far. They were up 3 scores at least Alabama kept it close and had momentum 
Come on... why are you gonna ask Hurts that question right after the game?
Still have yet to show a replay. Nice espn 
LIFE IS PAIN
Players should be banned from thanking God in postgame speeches... 
Wtf did he mean by that anyways? That was the weirdest and most coached response from a red to a player.
Absolutely UGA will be in. 
Really? 
Shut the fuck up
"I'd like to thank the Dark Lord Lucifer for this opportunity … all glory to him"
B1G
dankest timeline, you mean
Why in the blue fuck would you interview Jalen right now?“What were you thinking when you got benched?”
How the fuck you as a safety left the receiver out run you??
Wow ESPN don’t ask these questions 
So I pulled for Bama tonight and I was just wondering if anyone knew how to detox?
Hurts handling this well. Beast. 
#ImWithUCF
Tua totally sounds like he's from Hawaii
And god. Especially god. Go god. God is good
Lol please stop so cringey 
And Georgia fucking covers. Why is Vegas always right 
TOUCH THAT THANG FOLK
congrats to UCF on the natty that they now can actually somewhat legitimately claim 
Lotta fedoras in these comments right now
:/
“Yall mind if i praise god real quick”
Hurts is a classy guy. Gotta be bittersweet but he’s saying all the right things. 
"I'm here with Jalen Hurts--Jalen, where do you think you're transferring to next year?"
Does anyone want to bring back that post on Alabama recruiting boards about whether not he'd be able to adjust to a team that communicates in English?
You're watching it.
This is the type of QB to shotgun Natty. 
You're welcome, Bama fans.And congratulations on winning the national championship.
They just tweaked it from something even sillier.
Good fight Bama. See you next time. 
ffs Jesus doesn't win football games
Big ten 
B1G
Wasn’t his first game 
As a Cleveland fan I feel for Georgia fans. Falcons, Braves, Hawks, and now the Bulldogs. Wow. 
Woosh.  Learn your memes boi.
Tua 100% will impregnate someone tonight.
By whom? The officiating was not the decider. Georgia's poor passing and bamas stout line at the end did it.
Tua the next Tebow? Thank the lord.
Jalen Hurts has tarantulas on his head.
Georgia curse 
He's on suicide watch.  They're making sure he doesn't have access to shoelaces, belts, etc.
Someone might want to stay with Georgia tonight, I'm afraid they might do something drastic
WOW that was the worst interview ever
Being a nice and thankful child must be rare to see for you.
Hurts: smile through the pain
It's still great the be a Georgia Bulldog.  We'll be back.  The officiating in this game was...sub-optimal, but it is what it is.  Time for a terrible offseason and looking forward to a good season coming up.
"Ya know"
“I can’t think of any better use of my powers than to fix a college football game”-Jesus of Nazareth 
Good one! But would they beat osu?
Say True Freshman one more fucking time 
yep thats why It's hard for me to keep watching nba anymore. Its always the same two teams going to the finals. 
WAIT THEY'RE INTERVIEWING HURTS?? Man just let him live, his career as a Bama starter is over
Jalen has a great future in real estate 
Bama is too good. Time for him to go build up UTSA
Was that Russ Wilson or Tua Tagovailoa?
Stony Brook? Not that there's anything wrong with that, but it seems somewhat out of nowhere. Seport still basically printing money?
But they still beat Georgia? 
THAT FLAIR COMBO
First time I've ever heard a decent answer to a "What happened on that play?" question
and bama fans were concerned about tua's ability to speak english before the season
I don't think I've ever seen two quarterbacks interviewed
K
So what about the Christians on UGA? Guess God plays favorites.
So Georgia is the new auburn? 
just wait for the vikings saints game this weekend
WTF, interviewing Jalen right after the game. Disrespectful.
The kid throws a beautiful deep ball gotta love the left hand swag 
Roll Tide, UCF next week, right?
can you let us mourn please
Jalen should be throwing shade at God.  Why was he helping Tua and not me? 
faded
UCF is my Champion!
The last three National Championships have been amazing nail biters. The committee got it right.
Throw a sick pass to win it all. 
Does anyone think Alabama should have been here? Besides Alabama and UGA fans?
Naw man he’s in that weird Jesus stage that some kids are when they’re 18. He won’t break out of that for like another year
Saftey fell asleep and the CB just got beat.  Bad play by both of em.  Don't know if the saftey ever would have been able to get over there fast enough anyways.  He was out of position from the snap basically.
If we can't win it, I wanna watch the world burn.
Hurts interview is E!SPN being an asshole 
Jesus Christ the poor dude who has to ask Jalen that. Asking a college kid and amateur athlete that question.
[deleted]
QB held the safety on the hash by looking him off in the other direction. 
Guess I’ll need to pick a team and learn by next year. My school is D2 and irrelevant
lol they interview Jalen Hurts?
Fuck Alabama
Why?
Why?
Made this account after the Vanderbilt game. I been sayin it all year. His release, his eyes down field, his running ability similar to hurts. You could see it coming from a mile a way. I knew he would take it to the promise land.
Get fucking Richt.
WE DON'T TALK ABOUT THE SUPERBOWL IN THIS SUB.
Hey, we're used to it.
sounds like an 18 year old lol
Being a falcons and dawgs must not be fun
You dreamed about being on the bench? 
Cuz ESPN
Bama in particular is so dominant more than other teams in other sports.Bama fans must get tired of winning. 
Hurts is SOOOO PISSED
I was thinking the same thing 
as an independent observer, _strongly_ disagree. (but yes by all means, claim away, CFP is fucked)those lines are ABSURD.
Hurts looked like he wanted to punch him lol
I'm mad at that coverage breakdown. Goddamnit. All Georgia had to do was force a kick and that shit happens
Damn, what a game. Congrats to bama, it was hard fought until the end. Proud of everything the Dawgs accomplished this year, they'll be back next year!
Losing blows, but at least we made it this far. There's always next year tho'
Runningback
We are the only ones who tried
god dont love hurts
I don't think this is the place to discuss that 
I didn't like the interview with Jalen and thought it was a bit mean
Must suck for Hurts
Only thing I like about Bama
Same. You must hate Bronco lol
Not without the refs help
Not to mention the Sugar Bowl requires a lot less travel than the Rose Bowl does.
First 28-3. Now 13-0 at halftime, 20-7 in the 3rd, a missed fg into OT...then a kill shot. TWO TIMES IN ONE YEAR. BOTH CHAMPIONSHIP GAMES.This is so fucked up for a fanbase to go through. I almost feel bad but it's too funny.
He's going to love the comeback that Soccer gets in the state of Georgia this year. 
Seems like a humble and articulate guy.
Georgia football never fails to disappoint. Good shit to our dogs though. It wasn't as ugly as the Falcons collapse. 
I was thinking how they would either break it open on a freak play like Michele vs OU in 2nd OT, or their kicker would miss again two plays later 
*Lived. 
Yeah that was a dick move
Atlanta, Georgia. Makes sense 
lol, no
This is the worst year in the history of college football. 
Why would they even ask Jalen that question. Shit like that makes you hate espn
HUMBLE YOURSELF 
Also insert "a Georgia based team chokes"
Tomorrow? Next 7.5 months....
Hurts seems like a class dude. I feel for him getting pulled, but glad that he got a natty. 
Are we sure Tua isn't a Russell Wilson government experiment? I swear I heard a go Hawks at the end there...
Is it just me or was that passive aggressive as fuck??
Roll Tide!!!!
Lol one of these days
Throw a 40 yard TD to win the national championship #PraiseHawaiianJesus
True freshman with a comeback win. He can thank whoever he wants. 
Sounds like you've never been to the south
Here's some hate.
why lol?
Im glad Georgia fans got to experience what we had to go through.
Exactly. They should have been playing soft. They are up a fg. If they get closer, oh well, use the goaline as a 12th defender. 
already predicting this will be the lowest rated NCG in awhile. shits getting old. the fact Bama QB was recruited from Hawaii puts a bad taste in my mouth. can't compete with a team that gets the best from every corner is the US every year. 
There absolutely was defensive holding, which carries the same penalty as DPI. Is this also the point where I point out the missed defensive holding call on Ohio State's last third down and the missed block in the back that allowed the big punt return to set up the tying field goal?
that is the defensive coordinators fault. no way a player should be getting a WIDE open touchdown in a situation where a TD cannot be allowed.
Not drunk enough 
That sounds like the name of a porno that got way too into its plot 
Why? Without Jesus Georgia would have never blown the coverage that badly. 
Tua giving a coach's analysis of that last play
Also, they ask them first. 
Why do I choose to be a fan of this team?
Great game. Congratulations Alabama; well deserved win
Amazing game Georgia, this was an awesome game to watch. I have a feeling we’ll be seeing each other in these types of games over the next few years. And if there is one thing we can all agree on, it’s lmao@auburn
Well Bama did have a player swing at his own coaches so...
TRUE FRESHMANRESHMAN
Respect to Hurts. Fuck ESPN for interviewing him after that.
Hurts is a cool dude. That's a classy response.
Death.Taxes.And the state of Georgia choking in the championship.
Seriously and they’re gonna ask him that question? What a dick 
UCF
Why does it offend you so much?
I really like Jalen and i kinda hurt for him.
Espn please fucking stop 
yeah there's kids dying everywhere but god is helping me win the national championship because he's a cool dude I guess
why? they won let em say what they want.
Jalen is all class. I love you Jalen.
Like I'm just depressed 
Hey 48, look at Jalen right now. That's how you act like a champion.
Have you met their fans?
Alabama kicker got 10k on Georgia or what 
Son you just had the biggest moment in your life but you thanked Jesus so you can go fuck your self- That dudes parents lol
its not them its SABAN our LORD of  DARKNESS and his black magic. 
The balls of that TRUE FRESHMAN, sure, but its 2nd and 26 what else are you gonna call for a play?
Hurts is cable, Tua is DirectTV
"all the glory to god" as she rides him.    
Wow the safety.
How good does he love?
honestly Georgia's secondary is pretty bad. How the fuck do you let that pass happen 
Why? So we can hear "it's was a team effort" forty times over? Don't rain on that kids parade.
We all know jalen is not happy now. I wouldnt be if i was him.
Great game!
Exactly, Georgia choked it away. 2nd and 26 and got relaxed.
I'm not going to say we're without blame but the refs really fucked us over.
*Whooo*. I need a drink.
Also Georgia.
Sorry I'm just a true freshman
Can we get an interview from #48 ._.
God is a Bama fan i guess. Either that or Saban has a series of pentagrams in his backyard. 
Well, about that.......... 
Hurts is classy as hell. Nice kid!
Poor Jalen. Transfer to Columbia, we'll love you here stud.
Damn, Tua sounds like a fantastic dude. He makes me want to cheer for Alabama 
There is a God and his name is Tua
so fucking classless, more gotcha journalism.
Dude, if he believes in God and wants to thank God, let him. Damn. 
Fucking call after call extending their drives, ruining Georgia's. It took everything the refs could "reasonably" do to win this for bama.
Really?...At least call us cheaters. 
Anyone know what Tua meant when he said his parents would be mad at him playing in a NC?
Really what a shitty pass protection in the last play.
I Dream about this, .....ouch.
go on, I dare ya!
Yeah he knows he's done.
No
Jesus fucked Georgia. Confirmed
ESPN is basically TMZ for sports at this point.
Now for the long winter that is the offseason
I hate everything, but Bama has passed USCjr on my list of most hated teams of all time.
It was cringey as fuck
Yeah but GA was up 13 points 
What goes through peoples heads in these situations? Just go play your game and if you lose then you lose. First the Falcons and now Georgia... Fuck this sport.
I’m probably a tad biased but I seriously fucking hate B1G refs. When I saw the crew at the opening flip I said to myself, “Oh, boy.” Cheeky fucking bastard.
Y’all think the NFL is commercialized? At least NFL media doesn’t force players into 15 minute interviews the second the game ends. Let them enjoy the moment with their team
“Fuck all those starving children in Africa. Bama needs another ship. Roll Tide!”-Jesus Christ 
Alabama wins, America loses
Did you just choose it? You didn't go to UGA or anything? 
Sub optimal is putting it extremely nicely
Well the next time OSU wants to be in the playoffs they should probably avoid losing to Iowa by 31 points. I will never let this go.
I absolutely agree. They really need to give these great G5 teams a shot to prove themselves. 
He’s shaking his head at the end because he can’t understand why that dude is such an asshole either.
Third party but was rooting for Georgia. Great game, and congrats
That CB got fuggin ROASTED
:(. You okay?
yea, thats gonna haunt him for a while 
That throw was an absolute dime.
Really fucking stupid that they tracked down Hurts for an interview. Let him enjoy what he can instead of reminding him that he was benched.
Saban is the goddamned devil
Y'all'r still better off than UGA, you got 3 championships more recent than their last
Alabama is a super religious state. Cult like. 
Big 10
Jalen, come to Oregon State!!!!!!!
14 gets smoked again on the game winner    Edit: cover 2 safety blew that
I heard he hadn't been in the states for very long. Truly amazing. ^^^\s
In this moment, I am euphoric. Not because of any phony god’s blessing. But because, I am enlightened by my intelligence. - r/cfb
you do realize under the old format bama wouldn't have made the title game...instead they made the playoffs and beat everyone they played. what do you think the playoff is for?
Maybe he was saying they'd be mad if he forgot to do so -- otherwise that's quite the public call-out of his parents haha
So starving children are tha debil?
Great job you asshats
that was terrible defending yikes 
For real, some of the worst missed calls I've seen all year.
Yeah that’s it 
"I want to thank Jesus Christ..." -Freshman  "WoooOOOoo! We fucked they shit UP!" -Senior
You're delusional if you think UCF could have stayed within 3 possessions of either team on this field tonight. 
Pssst Jalen.  We have Pruitt 
Yeah I was under the impression there was justice in the world?
He is the next chosen one. 
Technically UGA'S Kirby Smart said he would claim national champion if he were ucf. 
I feel bad for Jalen that's shitty
How does Alabama get here? Clemson. We beat ourselves. Either that or the inbreeding is starting to pay off (it’s a joke guys). 
Jalen man.. Classy. 
Just a joke cuz he looks and sounds kinda young plus true freshman hype
Shouts out to Might Guy
Sounds like a movie
Falcons and it's not close.
Thanks espn. 
Man that blocked punt call completely changed the game. If officiating wasnt bias I think Georgia pulls it off
Yeah he should be thanking Dark Lord Saban
Why the fuck do you rush 3
Getting 3rd in an average conference, not playing in the conference game and getting an extra bye week as a result is earning it?
Maybe he would have quit multiple times over but his faith kept him going?
Indeed a godly performance by the zebras. 
Look of the safety and let it rip
UCF - GG EVERYONE
A called false start negates the blocked punt
Not ours 
It just makes it so cult-like. The human body and mind is such a complex thing capable of so much and you’re gonna give credit to some dude in the sky that may or may not be real? 
Yall salty af lol
C'mon dude, no need to go after his beliefs 
bleach
That’s involved in football anyway. 
Lol just said this to my family 
Grew up in Baton Rouge, I'm fully aware of this shitEdit: Got some LSU haters in here? Or are y'all just salty I come from down where you're from too?
Google says he’s 6-1 
Fuck ESPN.
He definitely laid off like the safety was right over top. I thought the same thing. He went to a jog as if a crossing route would be coming into his range and he needed to cover short. Big mental mistakes somewhere...
Subscribe Got any Indians facts or falcons facts ?
Why the fuck would you interview Hurts right now?  Seems insensitive.
Wow some garbage ass coverage for cover 2
i want them to interview 48 and ask him what was going through his when he was swingingto be fair, im convinced he had a concussion and thought the coach was someone else.
WHAT IS WRONG WITH THIS CURSED FUCKING STATE?!?!?!?
The Saban assistant curse lives on
Should've had him play that at the halftime show
Yah probably
*laid
LOL
Love it mayne.
UGA's coaching staff choking also contributed. 
A 30 year old freshman who left for the big leagues three years later.
Because the breathed his air? Why does Nick yell at anybody?
https://i.imgur.com/kEkl0JD.png
it's really hard. 
How did they not earn it? QB played lights out and led them back. Played great defense. 100% earned. Stop being salty. 
Jalen planning where he’s transferring too
Fuck Bama. Fuck Saban. All hail UCF CFP National Champs.
secret weapon. they all knew.
Yeah seems super level headed
Because Bama needs God to win nattys. Lol.
Props to Hurts doing the interview, typical tabloid BS from ESPN grabbing him right after the game in the hope of getting a line they could run with from him, glad he didnt give them anything
Do we get to see Florida Central as the National Champs?
"Hey Jalen,  how long does it take to refill the water keg?"-ESPN Probably
Why?
“Where the fuck is our thank you, Jesus didn’t change your diapers!” -Tau’s parents.
That has to mess with the DBs heads
lots of credit to him for holding it together though. I can't imagine a more bittersweet feeling...heavy on the bitter
absolutely. Never has a team had an easier path to the natty. 
Auburn did that twice. You're just second best at beating number 1 teams! 
Who is this fucking kid? He is about to get so much ass boys. He is living the dream tonight
Thank my lord and savior Jesus for winning a football game but fuck the starving children or displaced from their homes or all the fucked up shit. Some great beings he’s got faith in. 
I give him a lot of credit for how he handled himself on the sideline. Very supportive helping out the true freshman as much as he could. Can't be easy getting benched during the biggest game of your life. But yeah, don't think he'll be getting his starting job back.
Thoughts and prayers to Hurts' career.
It's pretty much expected of Alabama now to win or be in it every single year.
Yeah, I definitely don't believe that one.
Do you blame the coach there? Looked like a miscommunication between the safety and CB but looked like cover 1 manOr was it cover 2 and the safety fucked it up that badly?
Great game, hope to see you next year. I’m sorry our players were dirty AF
UCF - Bama next week.
yeah we will
“But we dont pay our athletes “
Everything.
"YOU ARE SUSPENDED INDEFINITELY!...WITHOUT PAY!"
That was a beauty of a safety look off and throw by Tua.
UCF would SMASH this Alabama team
Hawaiian Vick just teared them up.
I'm ok with it
there you go. LOL
The game isn't really about athleticism, it's about who prays the hardest duh!
Odd, that's never happened to me. 
Happened in 2011 too :( (not sure on the P5 part)
I'm just trying to contain the salt.  You know? Just bottle it up and bury it.
God hates Georgia
Bah gawd that's UCF's music!
I'll sound salty but blown calls have Alabama the game
I mean he took them to the Championship twice and then the game to win it, he wasnt even playing.
damn a lot of brothers and sisters are screwin' tonight!
Why even ask Jalen that question, you know he's bummed.
UCF ARE THE NATIONAL CHAMPIONS WOOOOOOO
Lol
Well clearly they showed they belong by winning it all. Weak argument. 
Cuz, you know, nobody on the other team is a Christian
2  penalties 
14 didn't even try...
I was wondering the same. Might have worried he would get hurt?
I'm not talking about that. I'm talking about all the facemasks, pass interferences and holds they blatantly missed but called on Georgia.
Yeah and then they say he showed a lot of class. Well if they can see what showing class is, then they can see how classless that was 
Nahh. I don't want you guys in our stuff.
Agreed, they blew it
Tua is getting women tonight.Plural. 
"What was going through your head when you tried to kill your coach?"
*punches reporter*
It really was. It was awesome seeing so many young players show up and play. But even though it hurts, it was a good game. 
My guess would be him not being able to go home over Christmas break but I don’t know.
Why the hell didn't they ever give #14 any safety help? he got destroyed the entire game
Great game Georgia. Let’s not do that again. I’m going to go shit my pants and pant heavily. 
I suck it up. Our basketball coach is super Christian but he’s too nice of a guy for me to dislike him for it 
(Other way.)
Good Game Dawgs you fought hard! Roll Tide
Happy for Alabama? OH HELL NO
Stay salty. 
Probably just didn't want him to play football because he could get injured
I mean, everyone's taking defense first
14 was getting burned all night...didnt see that coming...
Sanders has been consistently fucking up this half. I have no idea what he was looking at the entire time. He was the guy on the Ridley touchdown that marked him at first then let him go
Nick Saban has beaten Bear Bryant
Where do you wanna transfer? 
Who?
I think UConn women’s basketball would disagree
Hahaha, man, with that flair, I don't blame you for being hurt. Damn, not only did we win the natty, we literally destroyed your entire season two years in a row. 
*holds*
More than likely.
Chaney lost them that game with that terrible playcalling in the second half. Wildcat formation twice in the same drive for a net loss? Throwing on 3rd and short having some of the best backs in college football? Seriously? 
Probably a reference to him thinking "oh fuck."
If the false start was called there would be no blocked punt
Exactly, it's just the same shit every year. The teams at the top have a system that perpetuates their success. Bama should not have been in the cfp but they're Bama so they get in without being undefeated or a conference champion. 
[deleted]
Really hope Jalen stays and finds a place on the offense, If he leaves best of wishes to him.
Lmao I literally put the same thing in my Seahawks group chat 
Bunch of entitled fans. Must be nice
Refs like to rig it against you
Tua isn't from Alabama though...although the Poly community has a huge evangelical contingent and is HEAVILY Christian in general
Apparently Jesus likes 'Bama
Never should have married her and Ill find a new job. That game made it all better in my mind 
We're still figuring out what Ohio State needs to score in the playoffs.
I mean, he choked hard in the national championship and got replaced by a freshman who went on to win the game. Wouldnt be surprised, id be upset if i was him.
Because god didn't win the football game and hopefully doesn't care in the slightest about the result.
Parrish got bullied all night
UCF UCF UCF UCF
We'll take him in Gainesville. 
I can't believe you haven't had ten already.
More than any other I can remember. We won this with a QB and not in spite of one, from an amazing defensive effort in the second half, and a comeback for the ages.
It's not just him though. If Georgia won I guarantee you someone interviewed would say the exact same thing. It's almost as if God's will doesn't prefer one team over another.Edit: also imagine the absolute shitstorm if someone opened with "First off I just want to say allah 'akbar, before that last down I just kept repeating 'he'll catch this and we'll win insha'Allah'"
That jackass shouldn’t ever play on the team again imo
I got out the leftover champagne from new years. Cheers
 Hah! Because the NFL is where the officiating really shines! 
Uncle Jesse missed 2 FGs and Bama still won. 13-0 at halftime. 28-3 less than a year ago. 
God "I will smite those officials. I am not a Tide fan"
I feel a little bad for the guy
If Auburn pays him enough
Corner blew his coverage and the FS bit to hard and had a terrible reaction.  
You could see the Defense play much better with Tua in. Gave a new life to the whole team. 
And now, a pre-playoff Boise State/post-playoff UCF will never get in.  Time to expand, I guess?Great game, what a fun ride.
I hate Bama and I couldn't knock the decision. They just need to expand to 6 already. Conference champs and a wildcard.
Yup.  RIP
The #1 dual threat QB from last year?
I like UCF, but don't get crazy.
Goggles will be the first kicker to leave early for the draft 
Exactly.
TOUGH YEAR FOR GEORGIA AND BLOWN LEADS
Not with that shitty second half play calling
right with you
Georgia hadn't been burned that badly since Sherman's March
:_: makes me sad this game made me love Tua but I don’t want to shove Jalen out the door either after everything he’s done for us
He thought he had the safety covering over the top. 
I thought he meant his parents would be mad for thanking God before his parents
That’s fair. 
He's gonna go Ryan Leaf on the camera man. 
Possibly in Winnipeg.
Let's run Fromm out wide and direct snap to Michel. I WONDER WHAT THEY'RE GONNA DO!!!1!
I want to see an interview with the losing coach where he's just like "All credit to God for getting us to this point, I guess the other team just prayed harder. We've been looking at dropping a defensive assistant in favor of a team Pastor for the last few years and I think this might just be what tips the scales for the athletic department."
He was laying that on a little thick.  Idk how someone thinks it was God's work that made them win.  Like wtf God hates Georgia or something?
The edge in these comments regarding Tua just cut my hands off through my screen. Typing this with my nose.
Parrish fucking sucked all game. He didn't even touch the receiver. 
I see a fire burning, burning hot and bright, inside H8 ball. The H8 will never subside. 
We failed you I'm so sorry, never bet on Georgia sports all they do is hurt you
Did Saban & Kirby hug or just shake hands? Asking for a friend
That woke up the team and turned the momentum. It was all Bama after that. He da real MVP!
safety probably didnt expect a freshman QB to be able to look off safeties. I hate seeing a Bama W but damn that kid is something special.
The banner...I'm impressed yet utterly repulsed 
That safety is probably the worst football player on the planet. It was so obvious where Tua wanted to throw the ball. There was nothing even close to being open on the right side.
Nothing
He is going to be special. 
God that was just unnecessary. Buncha assholes
Same kind of bullshit they pulled with Scott Frost after the conference championship. 
You make a good point. Specifically, there was a dude on a knee in tears and some guy gets down next to him and puts the mic in his face. At least the camera moved on.
Your flair combo makes me cringe
Yup, all money goes to the B1G. None goes to the university or to ESPN or for merchandise. 
The saltiness is real. 
OH I love the fucking salt.....LET IT FLOW THROUGH YOU!
They aren't in the SEC so they don't get to play for championships.
there is no god
Tua thanks God and cfb puts on their collective fedoras.
The Curse of General Sherman.
If he leaves? He's only a sophomore
I think he meant his parents would be mad if he didn’t mention God. That’s when he went into “this is all due to God” 
The Falcons are still alive... Lets hope if there is a Rematch they dont choke again...
What a cluster fuck of a game, so much bs on so many sides. Really wanted this it's been a long time coming just wish Kirby would of subbed some people and quit going for the damn middle.
Dunno WTF was going through Chaney's head calling Wild Dog to Chubb when he hasn't been able to get more than 3, 4 yards all night. Goggles bails our asses out from 51 yards, we get a huge sack, and then Parrish gets gashed (like he had been all night) with no help over the top. WELP
[deleted]
True. 
Why would he go there? He wants to go to another great program, so he needs to come to Kansas.
Jesus is a true freshman 
The Jalen Tide? I could see it being competitive. The Tua Tide? Forget it. 
Saban is the greatest coach in history. Pains me to write it, but I think it's true. 
Historical burn. *Nice*
because ESPN
apparently no christians on Georgia
Go away /r/all
He iswww.nydailynews.com/amp/sports/college/alabama-fan-concerned-language-barrier-hawaiian-qb-article-1.3493395
Yuck.
Stand up individual for sure.
Based on the post game interview, I’m guessing he’s more a ‘saving himself’ type guy. 
Oh shit
Legit a joke. The defense completely imploded.
Georgia had ample chances to win the game. They took their foot off the gas. Don’t give the refs a chance to decide the game.And stop whining about the punt block. It was a false start anyways. 
I mean, the missed facemask that everyone else in America saw was enormous. As missed calls go, that was really really huge
You share a border with Alabama 
Why does every loss that a Georgia team has classify as a choke? I understand the super bowl last year, but I’ve been hearing this shit non stop for the last 5 years or so and it’s unbearable. Just because the team lost doesn’t mean it’s a choke...
Yankees? UCLA? It happens in those sports too
Sure, from Tua's perspective God was the one who gave humans such complex bodies and minds. From a believer's perspective, God is the source of everything
Hurts looked like he wanted to cry but he shouldn't be ashamed of anything. He won 12 games for Bama. Wouldn't be here without him. Respect goes to him for participating in the interview too. 
Yes I am salty that a team that didn't prove shit got to coast in on reputation and bullshit calls
If anyone won something here, it's Pappas. His kick went from going full Finkle/Einhorn levels of backlash to just some minor shit talk about his aim when playing cornhole.
As a Panthers fan he's on of the only QBs I've seen who runs at all like Cam. He could be a decent halfback maybe?
I thought that was pretty uncool. You could almost see him roll his eyes.
Oh dear god please. The one Columbia game I went to there were two TDs scored and it was two pick 6s we threw :|
Oh he smiled so big after the onside kick against Clemson 2 years ago
You need more Jesus, I guess 
It was a good competition between two teams, and God doesn't care who won. He is still giving credit for his life and his platform and moment to God. Is that okay with you? Georgia players can still give all the credit and glory to God for getting to 2nd best in the nation. 
Press F to pay your respects
You right you right 
Don't hate greatness man. Enjoy it
>BmAm
I wish we knew
"I'd like to think my lord and savior, home boy with the black and white pinstripe rocking the " R" on the back of his shirt. 
He looks like he'd fit in in Seattle
Bobbeh Boucher, you been playin tha foozball?!
That is up there with texas USC for championships. 
Seriously.  I cant believe some of the comments I've been reading
To me it looked like cover 2 as the other safety was backing up too but I aint no expert 
Seriously.  He and Hurts were both classy, imo.
Tua gonna get like 500k followers on Twitter and Instagram tonight
He beat the corner, safety wasn’t in the area until it was too late, and they had no other coverage against the deep throw. 
Never wash it again
Surprise? Our secondary has been a week point all season.
Solid recovery
Is there any offense Nick Saban isn't willing to run at the right time?  The winning play was basically the 4 verticals, one man isolated left side.   If the guy isolated left side can beat his man inside, it's an automatic touchdown because the safety can't get over fast enough.For example, this was basically Corey Coleman's career at Baylor. 
Yeah that’s brutal to interview the kid in what has to be the world’s biggest bittersweet moment. 
Tied him
Yeah i heard free speech isn't a thing anymorw
Going to be a rough night for all the cousins in Alabama.Half of them are getting laid.The other half are also getting laid.
Oh please.
Everywhere. 
The Devil Went Down to Georgia...who knew the Devil was a tropical freshman boi
Right. Papa Nasty should have ended it in regulation. 
I think he meant that he didn't thank god first? He said that right after.
Three way with twice removed cousin!
Are Tua’s parents not okay with him being so Christian?I’m very interested. I will find out one way or another
The only thing I could think of was he meant his parents would be mad at him for not starting off the interview by thanking his lord and savior? He did that right after saying his parents would be mad at him. Can't think of what else he might have meant.
I'm honestly not sure they would've scored. 
That facemask gets called and it might be a different game. There were a few suspect calls for both teams imo
Eh there were a couple of missed calls on both sides, a few more on the Georgia side but overall I thought it was a pretty well called game. The missed face mask was the only real bad one imo 
As a neutral fan, this has been an exciting game to watch. Bama did deserve this. Bulldogs were moving the ball but didn't punch it into the endzone enough and that cost them IMO. 
Took a while, eh?
Falcons for sure. 
https://i.imgur.com/Y5ehiM4.png
That was a damn dart of a throw though. 
I'll legit be shocked if they don't expand to eight teams next time it comes up for a vote (2019 I think?).  They are rolling in money from these playoffs.
Roll tide!
It’s almost like religious people draw strength from their religion during training and hard times etc and throw that out there in times of jubilance. 
:( why they kill the comment
Goodnight, all. It's been a marvelous season! Marshall will shock the world next year. /s
BuT bAmA dOeSnT dEsErVe To Be In ThE nAtIoNaL cHaMpIoNcHiP tHeY aInT bEaT nObOdY PaWlLLLLLll
I'm sorry man
Oh ok I get it
Huh? There’s nothing more sad than someone who insults themselves by saying that their talent and achievement was given to them by a made up god. Not to mention the offensive notion that god affected the outcome of the game but not the survival of some child in a war torn area or a disease ridden elderly etc...
He handled that with a lot of grace though. Props to the dude.
Lots of titties in the DM. 
I would take that embarrassing sack every day if i could follow it up with that baller pass
He deserves big props. Always stayed positive, seemed genuinely excited for Tua later. That had to be tough. Admirable
Username checks out
Thousands of children die hourly from starvation, yet you're pretentious enough to think gawd cares about your football ability. Gtfo
i just cant believe what i saw. this is crazy
That's what they said after they won the championship in 1980
Don't care, it stands. 
Tua will be a good NFL quarterback. Mark my words. 
Yeah, heard somewhere its cover 2. Bad by the CB to not play it closer but good lord the safety has to have that
Dawgs, I love y'all and hope you continue to dominate the east. I want to meet you and Kirby every november in Atlanta. Fuck Auburn, Fuck florida, fuck Tennessee
Clearly Jesus isn't a Georgia fan, right?
Same thing was said about Auburn
God fucked with Job, took his home, his farm, his family, his livelihood all to win a bet with the devil. Why wouldn't Jesus pick a college football team to pull for.
They were trying to bait him into shit talking the qb and discuss being benched and those implications 
Florida will but will only be a bad influence.
I think he meant for interrupting the interviewer or if he didnt thank God and his family. 
He smiles only when he wins NCGs. Personally I think we see him smile too much.
Still impressive for a TF to recognize the coverage and look off the safety for that long.
Anger level is high.
Falcons w/o question.  who knows if Georgia even game planned for Tua
We'd have a better chance if we played during a cat 5 hurricane
Choke
Jokes on you, the SECCG is played in the postseason
Georgia got too conservative.
I think he was saying his parents would be upset if he didn’t thank God first. 
2nd worst behind burnt toast aka #14
Nope. Grew up in Wisconsin. Just happened to be the team that grabbed my attention when I started watching football as a kid
He's definitely talented, just not at QB, he should definitely be able to play RB, WR or even a QB with Tua as a disguise and finesse formation.
hot take
That was fantastic. Congrats 
Woah there let's not get ahead of ourselves now haha 
Hard to say man, as a fan of basketball baseball and football all I loved it when the SF Giants won three in five years. Absolutely went crazy everytime.But like, I hate this right now and get why people do. It's a double edged sword. 
Well I'm done with football after the NFL season ends.
It was cover 2. Safety frozen by QB's eyes, corner missed his jam and is badly torched on the go route. Not to mention a perfect driven throw that gets there before the safety can.
It’s reddit. God is out
I think he was saying they would be mad at him for not saying that before anything. They're very religious IIRC
It's like they were trying to trigger him so they could get a viral video or some shit
I am hoping the Seahawks front office watched this game and already made an offer
I blame us, Wisconsin, Georgia, and Ohio. We let this happen. 
Cavs win confirmed. Thanks bama. 
According to the coaches room it was cover 3 and the corner should have had more help over the top.  The QB did a good job with his eyes holding the safety and going back to the open WR
The happiest person in the Bama locker room right now is their kicker
Neither of those plays were game ending. Not to mention the flag was really late and also nonexistent. Not even arguable, DPI never happened ya got gifted the win just accept it 
Tua comes from a religious family, he was referring to his parents getting mad if he didn’t thank god first 
I agree.  It seemed like they kept cutting out right before kicks
Take my damn upvote
Can someone pass the bleach?
At least it wasn't 3rd and 28.
F A U AU
Oh god, Bama fans are gonna be intolerable until next season. 
Seriously dude, North Carolina is the herpes capitol of the US and you are going to crack jokes about Alabama. 
It looks like 2 with the safety sitting on his ass. 
Most pocket poise I've seen in a college QB in a LONG time tbh.
When Alabama wins another national championship, I think to myself “no.”
[deleted]
I hate being this way, and I don't feel confident saying Georgia would have won, but they drew the extremely short end of the stick when it came to officiating tonight. Again, I don't know if it was a game changer.  And as much as I hate it, that last play was clean as fuck.  Georgia got screwed 2 or 3 times though.
Looked like cover 2, which is what the qb said as well. Safety didn't do his job. 
couldn't beat Auburn. Do you know who did? I'll give you a hint... they're undefeated.
Went to the same High School as Mariota and Masoli, I guess Alabama figured they’d just recruit who Oregon recruits in order to finally get a QB
Your lips to God's ears.The glasses would put him right at home on Capital Hill.
It's just the notion that God helped "me" but not "somebody else" that is constantly stupid to listen to
Maybe he didn’t give glory to god soon enough 
I'm not lying at all I swear on everything I own.. My mom said those exact words. 
Rest assured those were the two best teams in college football, guys.
Not okay with him not giving his praise to God I think. 
Honestly, other than the face mask, what did they miss/do wrong? 
Drafted in the first round by the Chargers
Refs screwed georgia..bad
No way they’d run cover 1 in that situation. Elite qb level stuff by Tua there to look off both safeties and then turn his head and tossed it in less than half a second. Fucking nuts If I was playing NCAA I would’ve played field goal there and gone Cover 3 - Pappanastos wasn’t making anything the rest of this game
He didn’t blow his coverage. He was expecting safety help over the top and the safety blew his assignment.
Are you potentially exaggerating maybe just a little bit?
That was really shit to ambush him with that. He handled it excellent 
Totally expected him to say "Holy shit" or something there... 
Yeah, I know. It was looking like there was gonna be a power shift in the sec starting this year, (kinda was, but a bit slower) but Georgia will be the next dynasty in cfb I think. But fuck man this sucks. I have the worst sports cities. 
Or Saban (Satan) made a deal with the devil..or he is the devil
Alabama should play dixieland delight
FYI, we’re terrible every season. 
Cover 2 and the safety mucked it up
Raise the nail polish!
BaMa sHoUlDnt bE iN ThE PlaOFS
Tom Rinaldi is the worst
he didn't really blow it. it's cover two. You expect the safety to help over top. Tua looked him off really well. AAAND Smith did a really good job of stemming outside release KNOWING the CB is trying to stay outside and force him to the safety and then getting upfield. 
Lol I think he was about to say what went through his head and then he decided to change the subject
I think he meant they would be mad that he didn’t start with that. 
Feel free to check my comment history, I never dogged Tua. But he FAR surpassed my expectations. If throwing like that and being able to run the ball sometimes, consider me a convert.
WHAT IN THE FUCK
They're all very Christian. Not sure what he meant by that comment
Better than Belichick?
I wouldn't call that a choke. I'm proud of them. This was supposed to be a building year!
We had to pull Kona old island magic to beat them. I just knew it was game over without it. 
UCLA hasn’t won a championship in decades and the Yankees haven’t in nearly 10 years?
Thank you Bama for this win. Georgia is hard enough to recruit against even without being a national champion. 
God is clearly not a Georgia fan, right?
The falcons welcome this holy sacrifice tonight. 
Transfer
The last thing they need is meth and gators
That facemask near the end of regulation sure didnt do you guys any favors :/.  Tough game
Yea. That game winning pass might've just saved Pappa from getting shot by some drunk redneck Bama fan.
$11mil gets you a good coach, I guess.
I think he was apologizing for not starting off thanking God before he started speaking.  Again I think could be way off. 
The question...why do you think they will be wrong?
They made out a little bit
That was my thought too.
Yep, the ref made that throw
Jesus... A twitter hashtag sign given to the players on stage where you can barely see the school logo?  We've gone too far :(
Congrats Bama 
I don't know who had a worse game: Georgia's Corner #14 or their Center #53. They were both just awful. 
Yep. Literally changed his life
Oh I seem sorry I misunderstood and thought you meant by the refs.
You can tell the way he threw up his hands he was supposed to get safety help. Impossible to know w/o knowing what the coverage was, but sure seems like the it was the safety who messed up.
Mainly blame Iowa 
Lol
yeah, proud of those players?
Well thats no surprise since they wouldn't call anything on Bama. There were facemask and unnecessary roughness calls ignored by refs that would've extended Georgia's drives whereas they had every little thing called on them. 
I imagine there's more than one fan of both The Falcons and Georgia. Thoughts and prayers.
This director looks like he’s from Whoville. 
One of the craziest ends to any football game I’ve ever seen. Missed short FG to force OT. Horrible third down sack to force a 50+ yard FG that just sneaks through. Then a 16 yard loss followed by a true freshman walkoff TD bomb. You’d be hard pressed to write someone that good. 
Implying they aren't at any given time even if they don't win.
Comfortable in your armchair?
Absolutely. Pretty unbelievable that he was playing high school ball last year...Also, his release time was unprecedented. That last play is a hell of a lot closer without his crazy fast release. 
Saban is ready for bed.
That's not how those work. There are a lot of other arguments, you know Bill Belichick, Bear Bryant, Coach K, etc. 
So this is all Wisconsin's fault, right?
I live and work in Alabama. Alabama fans are the worst. 
Safeties fault all the way
Most solild all around QB ive seen under Saban
Yeah, but I still hate Bama.
When Sabans kickers miss chip shots, I think to myself "yes." 
MVP has gotta be #48
Despite the teams, this was actually a really good game!
Tied, I think.
Y'all realize that offsides call changed the entire game
The safety on the left hash blew that imo. He was supposed to help over the top for the go route I think. He stayed inside too long. Could be because Tua kept looking in and kept him there, but still real bad D to end it. 
But they both went through stretches of multiple wins. 
He deserved both.
That and there were 2 cover men and a safety providing "over the top" on that side 
I think he is still developing his interview skills, and meant that his parents would be mad if he didn't thank Jesus.
God is dead and evil reigns supreme on Earth.  Meh.
Maybe something along the lines of not imposing your beliefs on others?
And go hogs!
Transfers somewhere else.. he ain't starting at bama again.
Yeah, watched it again and real beauty of a play by the QB to look him off and drop a beautiful pass. That being said, pretty bad from the safety unfortunately
Yo the crystal football was a way cooler trophy than this stupid gold ice cream cone
~~next season~~ the heat death of the universe
Not even close
Welcome to my world 
Same, I was kind of thinking in the back of my head.. if Georgia loses, the H8 Ball will... shudders... $%@& ???
Oh damn it has gotten really late. Tunnel vision.
God bless Nick Saban.
Fuck if we will. He’s not a great qb and I’m stoked for Emory. 
I still don’t think they deserved to be there, but they certainly did make the most of it.
Nope he loves Jesus too much
He JUST needs to work on his pass and he could be SO good. When he scrambles he's damn near unstoppable. If he's just a slightly above average passer, Bama never loses a game. 
For once I agree with a UF fan
He was apologizing to the interviewer saying, in effect, “sorry but before I answer your question, my parents will be mad if I don’t say all glory to god, etc.”He caught himself after answering one question without giving credit to the lord...so then felt bad having to go back to do so. He also kinda tripped on his words so it came out funny. 
In the end, we all lose, because ESPN somehow turned a one hour game into a fucking 4.5 hour affair 
Can we all agree now that bama didn’t deserve to make the playoffs? /s
Gonna slide because he's a lefty and be a bargain for somebody.
Please no 
Wouldn't have made OT if the refs hadn't forced it
ESPN the same org to ask Scott Frost about Nebraska as he wins the AAC
With Hurts, no
Can’t fool me, I see you trying to get that disrespekt juju going early!
I think to myself "yes."
I mean, probably
My [boi](https://i.imgur.com/UQm7EPO.jpg) high as a kite
Any intelligent person who said they didn't deserve to be in the playoff also noted that they were almost certainly one of the best four teams.If you think the CFP should be a power ranking, they're in.If you think the CFP should be the top four resumes, there's a very real case that they're out.Neither system is necessarily better, just different.  What most CFB fans would like to see is some consistency in the rankings, since it seems like the committee goes back and forth on which criteria they use.
I think the argument is there. He's god tier. Like Coach K, Belicheck, etc. 
Congrats Bama fans
I agree. But that's his demeanor. A true sportsman. I'm glad they didn't interview #48 lol
you watched him for like 30 minutes of game time please stop 
Has the be the emblem of good sportsmanship. What a great guy!
cover 2 and safety got looked off real dirty
UCF>Bama
Agreed. So multi-tooled. Honestly, he showed shades of Rodgers. 
People think their classy until a salt inducing event happens.
That dude lost his shit. Pre-CTE?e: https://youtu.be/e8O_Z89sBeM
Shh your head child. Cover and escape the night!...
I concur. I too also hate robo calls. 
They definitely helped Bama.
Don’t get me started on Notre Dame....
I would totally agree, but the refs fucked Georgia at a couple of crucial points.  Georgia was outplayed to be sure, but they should have had the ball a little more than they did.
Yeah CB needs to do better but if that's truly cover 2 or cover 3 that has to be more on the safety
Fuck yeah he is. His warm milk is ready to go in the locker room. 
As a safety, you keep backpedalling, basic high school shit, cover your zone and don't let anything get behind you. Looking at the QB??? What are you gonna go break up an out route. Nothing AL did their was amazing on that play.
Yeah, well this was the dirtiest game I've seen since 2013
I'd respond, but I'm still hungover from our second playoff appearance. Nice of you guys to try this year though!
The refs sucked but your coaching staff sucked way more in the 4th/ot.
Kind of like Falcons fans?
Eh it looked like they let a lot go. But hard to say one side got more than the others. The stuff they called looked pretty blatant to me
[deleted]
You never got the panties off someone before? I'll believe you.
Ah the ol' four verticals cheese
With the way people talk about god in postgame interviews, it sounds like that’s what they’re suggesting. That they prayed harder. It’s bizarre 
I don't think the safety deserves all the blame, or even most of it.  The cornerback in that formation with 1 receiver isolated left side, 3 on the other, cannot at all costs give up inside leverage.  It's the easiest bomb for any quarterback, even at the college level, to complete if he does.There's simply not enough numbers to have a safety protecting the 2 wides other side **and** another safety to double cover the guy on the left **and** someone to cover the running back sneaking out of the backfield.
*passes bleach*
Punt block was CLEAN!! Never should’ve gone to OT. Nothing like a bunch of god damn zebras deciding a game.
He should just go out for the draft... Nothing left to prove here
True freshman tho
Ooooohhhhj
Mostly Oklahoma really
That's not on the corner. It's a Cover 2 look. Just a great job by the QB. 
And Auburn for giving bama that quality loss
Refs are pretty damn good. #2 ranking for them?Just salty. That Bama QB looked great tonight.
Ok lol 
People just want something to be mad at. Tua seems like a good kid. Great moment for him.
It was really fun watching it in 15 second intervals too.
Def
After reading the comments here after halftime, let's just say this was particularly satisfying.
so when does UCF show up to crash the party
Because we win every season! Lets go!!!
Honest question because I was watching on my phone and didn't follow the game thread, but I'm seeing a lot of comments to this effect. Which calls are people up in arms over?
Tua just looked off the safety and made a perfect throw. No blame, just a better play by the offense.
He just hasn't shown he's got any better, meanwhile true frosh is out there looking off receivers and throwing dimes
Homie transferring 
Just a reminder that despite the Crimson Tide win, do not eat Tide Pods in celebration.
Amen! Roll Tide!
Underrated comment. Loved football all my life but I'm enjoying NBA/MLB/NHL and even PGA tour nowadays more and more and liking football less and less. The vibe around the leagues has gotten worse and the advertising is a fucking joke in my opinion.  
Lol and Clemson? I know we didn't have too great of a chance, but still
Honestly - deserved it last year and deserved it this year.  GOAT coach, arguably GOAT program.
[Actually, UF's kicker (Eddy Pineiro) has already declared for the draft.](https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/2017/12/19/florida-k-eddy-pineiro-leaving-school-early-for-nfl-draft/108763474/)
Blankenship's dad created a website to hype him when his son played soccer in high school. He even made up stats to hype him up, like time of possession, because his HS team wasn't any good. The website/blog was a scary look into Goggles' dad living vicariously through his son. There are also articles out there where he attacks Kirby Smart over Blankenship's scholarship situation. Goggles is awesome, but his dad is a POS.
It was also a risk by the qb. He looked off the safety but he didnt look back to check if his Wr was open, he literally turned and flinged it blind
blahblahblah jesus christ get over yourself.
Why are we still here? Just to suffer?
Thanks...*violently chugs entire bottle*
He was God's favorite angel. 
As an Alabama fan, I don't like Alabama fans. Grateful to be in Texas. Less embarrassing here. 
Shut up Tebow
Wouldn't Tua be Johnny in this scenario?
Tua is so wholesome
God loved Bama more guys
What?...Please expand... 
I remember seeing tape back in the spring and thinking he was great. I feel vindicated for telling buddies about some 18 year old on the bench for Bama being the reincarnation of Christ all year.
Atlanta football has gotten double penetrated by Belichick and Saban this year. They are best friends in real life too, now they are gonna discuss these wins on fishing trips. 
Call me salty as fuck but 5 wins in 9 years by one team is not fucking fun. When you can pencil a team in to the national championship game every year its fucking boring. TEAM PARITY 
It’s just so bizarre to me. I’m very much rooted in science and reason so the whole concept of god just doesn’t make sense to me at all. 
Didn't even try. Stopped running well before the ball made it to the receiver and I guess just hoped he wouldn't make a wide-open, uncontested catch. Then put his arms up like "are you kidding me?" Like bro the fuck did you expect?
I'm happy for the win but I'm sad that the season is over.
True. second half Refs tried to keep Bama in the game early on. Didn't like that.
Tua sounds like he just won a beauty pageant, trying to thank literally everyone. So innocent, I love it.
Tua is a baller. Spitting that football knowledge 
Yeah, good job, you got my point. The refs don't give a shit.
Seriously, if they'd lost it would be something he could never live down. 
Let's remember Auburn is the real loser tonight. Roll Tide! GG
Transfer
Almost all of my hate for Bama has flipped to the rest of you blaming the refs. Fuck off yall, if a couple of calls early third q cost you a game, maybe UCF really was the better bet. Damn
Thank you! And the Hurricanes were great this year. 
Kid must be feeling like he's on top of the world - but still so humble!
Lol the whole thread agreed earlier, but now nobody but Bama fans left to downvote you dog.  You should have had the ball a little more than you did thanks to those two missed calls, but TBH you probably wouldn't have done much with it anyway judging by most of the second half.
Draw as much strength as you like from your belief system but recognize that your strength and confidence won the game, not a fucking miracle.
So this is the trophy presentation but I don't see UCF...
Put Tua and Tebow in the same room and see who talks about Jesus more.
He's the second coming of Tebow, who was the second coming of Christ.
Except not really because if it was called correctly as a false start they would have just backed up 5 yards and kicked again, not get the block. 
No, no one deserves that level of heartbreak
U C F  C  F  
We sacrificed 2016 to secure one final push of Disrespekt power. We subtly pushed our stud DC to FSU to keep the flame roaring. 2018 AND 2019 will be the year of the Spartan. We. Shall. Rise. We will summon storms, we will call ridiculous plays, we shall strike down Satan.It is known. 
Yeah there's a little more to it than just that
Exactly. I'd think they'd give them underneath and force them to get 26 yards in 3 plays because Saban sure as hell isnt kicking. But think it was cover 2 and Tua caught the safety cheating by looking him off. Great play but thats not good from the safety
Is Tua mormon? Mormons are super prevalent in hawaii 
lmao.
Just because he helps one guy doesn’t mean he was hurting the other team. 
No doubt, heck of a look off and throw, but you are right that safety can't let anyone over the top in that situation.
Really if bama didn't lose last year ESPN wouldn't have had to have their revenge game between Clemson and Bama
Lulz
Troll Tide 
As they hand the award to Saban, the glass shatters and UCF comes running down the ramp. Bah gawd!
Umm... Roll Tide?
Who designed those hats? Those things look like shit.
It wasn't great coverage, but the safety was on that half of the field with absolutely no one to look at but the wr who scored 
Belichick had all his success with the GOAT QB. Not that he isn’t the best in the NFL but I have so much more respect for someone who loses their entire roster every few years. The margin for error is so small in college football, especially with the championship requiring 2 bowl wins now.  And he did it with two different teams. 
If Saban coaches the Browns do they win?
That was a really fun game to watch for the most part. But there are times I'm reminded how sloppy the game is at this level. I realize the kids are tired at this point, but that short lived overtime was hard to watch. Sloppy play by both teams. But fun game nonetheless
I'm not religious, but I have to wonder if a belief in a higher power helps with the player's confidence in nail bitter situations. Perhaps just knowing that somebody has their back, takes a little bit off their own  shoulders and helps them play like they always do...Maybe kickers should convert? haha 
It'll still be Tebow
He's talking about his lord and savior again guys... 
It all comes to an end. This is just the longest streak ever. It'l end though. Enjoy it. You can say you lives through the Bama dynasty!
At least you're not some fairweather fan. Winning has the most meaning in an ocean of defeat. 
[deleted]
Whats wrong with talking about Jesus
I mean that's where the devil hangs out so I guess that makes sense
Dude, let Tua be religious if he wants.  He's not being a dick about it.  This isn't r/atheism. 
[deleted]
Not a fan of Bama but even less of a fan of ESPN and Luginbill after that bullshit post-game interview with Hurts...I didn't think my opinion of ESPN could sink any further but I was proven wrong.Edit:  Rinaldi, not Lugingill...sorry Tom, wrong Tom.
Tua: god allows millions to die from famine, poverty and random violence but thank you for caring about Alabama football
So much Russell Wilson in Tua's game.  PR meets QB
I’m pretty sure the Cardinals and Giants have more championships than the Yankees this millennia and the UCLA stretch happened before many of us were born. Renders your point moot, right? My point is that for the last decade and a half it’s been mostly GSW, Bama, Clemson, New England, Steelers and Lebron’s teams representing championship teams. Not much parity unlike baseball and college basketball in the same time frame.
I love Tua. It's making me not upset Bama won
should've been a 3 safety set at that point though
I am a Braves and Falcons fan so I know the pain.  I grew up in Georgia but my dad went to OSU so I grew up knowing and watching OSU football.  They have had success as of late but watching the Braves in the late 90s and 2000s was like getting your hear ripped out after winning 110 games a year.  Same with the Falcons with Ryan, never able to get over the hump.  Kirby Smart got out coached in the second half.  They went to the run TOO early and Fromm got cold, as was clear by the last possession and OT.  What a waste.
"How did it feel to have Tua come in over you? Be honest here."Fuck that reporter man
This dude is trying so hard to show humility
That cockroach was looking for a sound bite and Jalen shut him down. Fuck ESPN
Salty
Who said anything about eating them in celebration?
Ehhh beautiful play from Tua but safety still can't get looked off that badly. Really tough play but you have to have over the top coverage there
Whats up with hawaii making such crazy qb prospects? 
Leave as in transfer is what he meant, I believe.
Look at you being all edgy and such, nice try.  
Payne is so adorable.
#4 Alabama beat #1 Clemson, and #3 Georgia beat #2 Oklahoma.#4 Alabama beats #3 Georgia.The committee was literally 100% wrong on these seeds at least. This is why we should let these things be decided on the field rather than by committee. By extension, Alabama may be better than UCF, but we'll never know, because UCF never got a chance because on "paper" they aren't good enough. Games shouldn't get to be decided on paper.
Right? That one Georgia “touchdown.” 
Feel bad for him. Props for sticking it out and being a **great** teammate there. 
Right...come on Tua, Jesus didn't throw that ball...you did 
I've been burned way too many times in the past to know Vegas is always right. Just mind boggling to me how close they always get it 
Honestly who believes UCF would've had a hope in a million against either of these teams
Oh I am satiated... extremely so 
Who?
Yep.  Fuck him for what he did to Miami, but he's a great football coach.  Terrible, terrible human being, but a great coach. 
They start dropping in from the rafters like Sting.
Late? Out in pac 12 country, we would have just kicked off a half hour ago!
nah. In ours the 8.5 point underdog won with a snubbed heisman candidate against "the best team ever assembled."  In this game the team nobody wanted to win came back and won.  Everyone just feels dirty afterward.
Luckily it's his podium time and not yours. Guy can say skittles willed him to win if he wants
Nothing.
The calls screwed you, but you had enough opportunities that I'm going to say you lost this game just as much as the refs did. You had them at 2nd and 26 with a kicker who had no confidence, the only thing you couldn't give up was a big long TD play.  Also you wouldn't have been in the game if not for 2 FGs he should've kicked, if your kicker didn't nail a monster fg. If Fromm could complete basic passes like a quick out you also would've won this game. Plenty of chances.
Cover 2. Safety got caught reading the eyes of the QB. Sucks.
* They called the very first punt of the second half incorrectly. Georgia should’ve gotten the ball inside the 10 with their first possession. * They missed various holds by Bama’s OL the entire second half but came back and called Georgia for multiple penalties which shows they weren’t just “letting them play”* They missed the personal foul where the Bama player *mushed* Fromm’s helmet as he was trying to get up. And that was right in front of the referee. * The very next play they miss a plant PI on Ridley. And again, it wouldn’t be a big deal if they decided not to call it the other way, but no. They called Parrish for it on the next Tide possession. It was blatant favoritism to try and make the game interesting for ratings. 
Salty 
It's like in a rpg when you beat the final boss, but the guy from earlier in the game you forgot about comes out of the shadows.
Yep. Looks to be the case. Unreal from Tua but poor from the safety. Tough play
Tua's brother in the background loooolll
Funny people say that when its been proven that refs call much less against Bama's opponents than any other team.https://www.teamrankings.com/college-football/stat/opponent-penalty-yards-per-gameTons of holding calls they could have made against georgia tonight.
Now watch as Jesus turns this Gatorade into wine 
No, it's my point exactly. Teams and winners change over time. 
I agree with goat coach, goat program makes me salty tho
Huh? There’s nothing more sad than some dude getting butthurt over “shut the fuck up” and then writing a long drawn out reply that no one will read 
Watching this with nothing to lose was pretty fun.
And he’s better
No, he already proved he can't hang in the NFL 
A game?
Georgia blocked a punt at the 10 yl and got called for offsides when they weren't.
Yeah, never thought about it that way actually 
[deleted]
Moved away from HI to Alabama.Gonna be able to move back with an upgrade just fine in a year or two.
Eh. Get good.  No point trying to bring them down. Just elevate your own game. Ole Miss beat the crap out of Georgia a year ago and look where Georgia is today. 
I used to think God didn't give a shit about college football, but he might actually root for Alabama.  He sure blinded the refs at a couple of crucial moments haha.
MVP is the emotionally-dead, exhausted husk of a defeated man dragging himself in for a 10 hour workday tomorrow. Good....*sighs*.....good game. I'm going to bed. 
Welcome to the darkest of timelines. 
This fucking graphic
completely classless.... "oh hey Jalen, you were sucking and got pulled and your replacement won the game, how do you feel!?" come on dude back off
Big 10.
Prevent defense exists for this exact reason lol or at least blitz. Do something other than cover 2. If you run cover 4 thats another sack and maybe a game ender.
ESPN's graphics holy shit
No drinks for true freshman tho
Kentucky got the shortest stick from that bastard ref, I have no hate for them 
You mean like...in any sport? If so this is a pretty bold claim
THERE'S NO MORE COLLEGE FOOTBALL UNTIL FALLNO
Has to be bittersweet for hurts
So edgy 
Dem hats fugly
I frequent r/CFB. UGA fans are the worst.
Georgia hasn't won a championship since 1980
Probably right. He needs to get there sooner.
When that Hancock guys said he wanted to congratulate i swore he was going to say UCF... then i remember we're atuck with this flaud product for another 8 years....
can't do dick in the pros
Yep. College ball is a ton of fun, but the level of play is the reason I'm an NFL fan first and foremost. 
Endzone pick that would have prevented Bama FG. 
exactly. the kicker had no confidence. it was 2nd and 26 so you could even afford to give up 10 yard run chunks or pass plays. Really the only thing that you couldn't give up was a big long pass.
For thanking Jesus Christ first and foremost over even his parents. If they are Christians, they won’t mind one bit
Your team's kicker is the opposite of a lot of kickers, though. Except ours...
That's the answer I was hoping for 
Yeah something needs to be said for that. Hurts isn't a paid professional. He could have lose a lot of credibility if he answered negatively. Not that he would but that's such a fucked situation to put someone in. 
reddit is pretty anti religion, otherwise nothing. everyone is allowed to believe in whatever the hell they want.
A 66-year old won his 6th national championship.666
ESPN. That weird bear and saban cg nightmare is the dumbest thing I’ve ever seen on tv. 
Je'sus Hula'lula Ch'rist'alaka
They shouldn’t. The fact that they won doesn’t change the fact that their performance throughout the year was not deserving of a spot in the playoffs. 
He's got a point (I mean, not the worst football player part)--they'd gone after him almost every passing play.  How he didn't automatically have help is beyond me.
We saw him in the NFL once
32 teams. Just like every other division in college football. 
"His parents relocated from Hawaii to Alabama..." Just like... why?Edit: guys, it was a joke
>Georgia hadn't been burned that badly since ~~Sherman's~~ Brady's MarchFTFY
Georgia fans would’ve (and likely still will be) worse.
You can’t believe that people think god is a silly concept? 
The adults are still playing though :D
It’s Reddit, it’s all atheism now
So what should've happened?
Bama had a massiveTDDrive with 2 brutal holding calls ignored in the 3rd 
Are you sure? Isn't Angels in the Outfield a documentary?
mostly bitter
They're like legos, you're supposed to put them together to make a magic sundae
[deleted]
I wanna bring back the 1991-1993 coaching staff with saban and belichick 
Auburn
You should still have it after the Peach Bowl
SAD
I been screaming bench him all season, but in that post game interview i felt bad for him saying hes always dreamed of this. Has to be the most bittersweet thing imaginable. I'm glad they finally made the swap I just wish it had happened earlier in the season so it wouldn't sting as badly.
This is the Internet and Christians are evil, don't you know that? /s
I had no real dog in the fight and don't mind Bama or Saban honestly. I just like making jokes about him
Yeah he isn’t saying Jesus chose Alabama over Georgia. He literally thanked Jesus and said all things are possible through him. Guy is religious and can say whatever he wants after winning a title. I know being edgy and atheist is popular on Reddit, but in the real world there are actually religious people who draw strength from that. 
Repost from the superbowl.  Amazing how it's still relevant.  Poor Georgia.  They may just disband all sporting.
CB probably needs to hold up the receiver longer too. Just beautiful execution by bama and *just* not good enough by georgia. What a play
Win or lose, you guys shitting on Tua for his speech and religion are assholes. 
GG, Bama & Georgia.  
Dankest?
You seem to be lost, buddy. This is r/CFB, not r/atheism.
That is indeed what I mean. It is a bold claim and there are several others with equally excellent claims, but I think this cements him as being able to make the claim. 
The last two championships were better but this one was great
You must have turned the game off for the third quarter. Go watch it or read any conversation about it. Not saying Bama didn't pull it off in the end, just extremely unfortuante for UGA with the way all the no-calls went.
We'll never know. Both of those teams lost to Auburn.
I'm glad design is moving away from the stupid flat bills.
Drank it all...need more
So the whole UCF claim is greater if Bama wins came true after all. We get shit on for a "horrible" schedule meanwhile UCF is praised after playing 2 p5 teams all year long. 
I need this Atlanta sports streak to continue for another week so my birds can get to the NFC Championship game. Fly eagles fly 
No foosball in Hawaii
Never forget Flacco with wings 
You just saw why. They had a son who is an amazing quarterback and Alabama wanted him on their team
It really is something. Georgia's entire strategy is to run the ball straight up the middle and manhandle anyone trying to stop it
Because if someone opened with "First off I just want to say allah 'akbar, before that last down I just kept repeating 'he'll catch this and we'll win insha'Allah'" there would be an absolute shitstorm of xenophobia
so many holds on Bama's offense that went uncalled on the 2nd half
lol
Who’s we? Flair up homie 
Yeah, not like they beat a team that beat both of these teams.
To be fair,  the second longest streak ever was 5 Bama champs in 16 years.  :)  Other people get upset when the two greatest college coaches of all time are at the same school.
They arent choosing the team that most deserves it, it was the "4 best teams" so yes you are correct
I did this after our game, so many poorly called plays. I'd try and get over it now or you're going to have a bad time. Y'all had a good season and y'all Dawgs will likely be back next year.
At least he is to his parents
Tua's little brother flashing a bunch of dumb signs in the back of his parents  Edit: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TceLxTsv6OA
Especially considering #14 was getting burnt all game. Surprised they didn’t explicitly assign him over the top help 
Why is everybody talking about Ucf? I don't get it 
Except when it mattered. 
Quick release, cannon, great awareness, and a great running ability. Watched him play a few games and you could tell he was a game changer.
I had faith in him. After I scouted him when Bama recruited him, I knew he would be good. He just needed a chance to prove himself and this game right here showed that. Better stick with him though and move on from hurts. You guys got someone special in Tua. 
Neither defensive back had any chance on that play even if they didn’t give up. The corner expected help over the top so he bit on a cut. The safety blew his coverage. That’s why he threw his hands up. 
Apologies to the guy I told to go to bed at 830. I could never have predicted this ending. 
Flair up boi.
Have you considered not calling 3 fucking passing plays with ~3 minutes left in a tie game? Or even getting a first down to keep a potential game-winning drive alive? It was Georgias game to win and they just didn’t finish it out.
There was a bad call on a blocked punt (refs called offsides when it was actually a false start - didn't really affect the game as they would've just backed up 5 yards and kicked again). Refs missed a blatant facemask on Bama that killed a UGA drive, but called one on us late in the game that kept a Bama drive alive. Couple other examples. The refs did not cost us the game, we did that ourselves. 
Feel for ya, great season man
He said something along the lines of “ I’m sorry. my parents are gonna get really mad but first and foremost I’d like to thank my lord and savior Jesus Christ”
You know...I forgot all about that. 
Didn’t he choose Notre Dame? lol
This is a consequence of the pisspoor mechanism college football uses to determine their national champion, because without a shadow of a doubt Alabama was not the best team in all of those five years. But when the field is whittled down to automatically selecting from the same 5-8 teams every year, and you only have to win 2 (or previously 1) game, the simple math is that the odds of each individual team go way, way up.Alabama has been great over the last decade, but also given more undue opportunity during that stretch than any team in any sport ever. 
If only there was a way to have a contest to see who is better across two teams....
I love it because the UGA and Falcons fans I know would've acted like they put a man on Mars if they won one or both...instead they lost both because the Universe knows I am being for real.
Either way there was a false start penalty. Same result would have happened.
Greatest coach of all time hands down. Winning a Natty Championship in this era is significantly harder than winning in Bear's era. Saban is a wizard. Wanna see how good he is? Put him in the open market and see how much money teams would be willing to spend on him 
I'm sure he's very happy, he contributed to a national championship. Can't be too sad about that
Auburn
I absolutely hated when the Giants won in 2012. I’m sure you could figure out why though, based on my Flair. I don’t know what it’s like for any of my teams to even come close to a championship. Born a month after the Reds won theirs in 1990 and both them and the Bengals haven’t gotten close since. So I could only imagine what it’s like for you to experience it. 
It's better if you just accept it. Sore loser.
I agree. Gotta give him props. He won 12 games this season.
Seriously dude, I know there were bad calls, but to assume conspiracy is just far-fetched.
Don’t leave the games to the refs.
[deleted]
He’s not lost, just speaking some logic 
At this level? Let me introduce you to my Redskins
also not religious. you might be right. but also you could overdo it and be like "i don't need to move my arm for this pass because jesus will do it for me"
I'm a Jets fan. 9 years doesn't sound that long.
Jeez.  Thanks! 
Seriously just respect the mans right to believe what he wants
Georgia Tech has won more recently, 1990
If they deserved it, they would have ended the game with more points.
Fuck that! Falcons breaking this curse this year!
So sorry Georgia/Falcons fans. Good luck to the Falcons this year.
Marshawn Lynch would appear from thin air beside him.
Or giant Julio Jones destroying pirate ships with Tampa Bay Buccaneers logos in them
There were two that changed the game imo. A blocked punt was erronesly called a offsides on bama's half. And a blantent facemask that was missed which would of kept a huge drive alive. Not to mention a punch to the head that only resulted in a 15yrd penelty and no ejection. Regardless. I think UGA could of pulled it out and just plain didn't.  But you are not going to hear the end of it...
For the sake of hilarity, I will support this action. -	Terrible Cowboys fan
You saying Jesus can't hit a curveball? 
I mean if you're going to use that argument then you must also acknowledge how much of an advantage a program like Alabama has in resources, brand, etc. compared to most of the field; whereas pro teams enjoy no such advantage. What they've done is unbelievable, but you can't handwave Belichick's success as simply a product of stability.
[deleted]
Shut up please. Thanks
2 of those games were won by a possession and the last play of the game. That's as close as it gets. C'mon.
Hey welcome to the club tiger bros!

If it means anything I just finished a master's in geology. Studying science and belief in God are not opposites at all... if anything, believing in God gives me an even deeper appreciation for studying the natural universe.
If Saban calls telling you he wants your kid to play at Bama, you fucking move.
It's all psychological, which is why and how ideologies are so effective. 
Superstition in any form has been shown over and over through legit studies to be effective in increasing confidence.  It's all psychological, but the power of belief is powerful 
Doesn't take away the fact the kid threw a dime after getting sacked. That pass was pure gold 
I know you're just joking, but their son just threw the touchdown to win the college football championship. That's why.
Back to /r/atheism you go!
I'm celebrating the Crimson Tide victory by pounding Tide pods as fast as I can
Good lord you have to respect how close that last play was, though. CB doesn't jam the receiver for long enough and Tua looks off the safety and drops in a beautiful pass. Literally perfect execution from Bama and so, so close by Georgia
28-3...20-7...both OT losses in GoT season finale fashion.It's only cruel if you're a fan. It's hilarious for all the other fans. 
I GOT I GOT LOYALTY, GOT ROYALTY INSIDE MY TRUE FRESHMAN 
You got a source on that one? Because based off the nasty and brutish nature of our world, along with all the suffering of innocent people, I'm having a difficult time seeing where you're coming from here. 
To everyone complaining about Georgia sports, please don't forget about our beloved Georgia Swarm
The final tally is: 3 pairs of underwear, 2 heart attacks, and 1 five gallon bucket full of hand wringing. Epic game.
As a Bama and Eagles fan...yes please
What's even crazy is that they're both left-handed.
He ain’t wrong tho
Just one big tournament starting in September.  You lose, you go home and play the other losers for the rest of the year.
Breaking News: The score decides who wins sporting events. More at 11
The 14 point lineman TD pass in the semi was really the way to prove it.No one has his combination of man management, balls, and intelligence.
I'll give you #s 2-4, but the missed punt call wouldn't have given Georgia the ball. It was a false start on Bama which would have just backed them up.
It was 20-7
He’s 18 dude. Not expecting to play tonight. Ended up with “mvp”. Fucking chill. Maybe you should take a trip to Hawaii soon and fucking relax like Tua 
I disagree. The game was 50-50. When Tua came in after the half, Alabama was like a totally different offense that shook up the Georgia defense. 
Only a Bama fan could even have that pop into their heads, minutes after THAT. I get it, but holy shit I'd be on cloud 9 for a month.
Belichick is still better imo... in college you can coast on great recruiting. Pretty sure this bama team can win 6 games with any coachPatriots are good despite a draft system that punishes success
He probably lost a bet.
Again, I think Belichick is the GOAT NFL coach. But having the best QB of all time is more than just stability. It’s the biggest advantage in the sport. OSU and Meyer have pulled in classes like Bama and haven’t had anywhere close to the same success. 
I thought a cover 3 or 4 would have been acceptable there. But, for some reason, cornerbacks are up when they needed 26 for a 1st 
Eh... still doesn't seem worth it/s
We were brutal the first half and then Georgia was pretty sloppy the 2nd half. That's what happens though when we got those brutal semifinals just a week before. These guys are exhausted.
Since Mariota
Ah gotcha! haha. God wants a fairly called game. An obvious facemask should be called. That's one of the commandments isn't it? "Thou shalt not make a sketchy call worth 15 yards"
No teef in Bama doe

True that. At least make it a 4th down TD or something. 
So the refs allowed us to score 23-7 in the second half. The refs Didn't cover the wide open reciever to lose the game? Finally the B1G refs were cheating for Bama. My god this sub is delusional 
Confirmed as the devil himself
It was pretty clearly not a catch, though (at least by the rules of the game).
lol you'd have 50 upvotes while the game was going (just read back over the thread and it's obvious) but point it out as soon as the clock hits zero and it's downvote city baby.
bama wins 100 championships in a rowBama fan "its history pawlll, if you cant appreciate it you just dont understand footbawllll"
More like 20 minutes but ok
The wrestling fan in me really wants UCF to interrupt and re-enact [this moment](https://youtu.be/c9PIdDXmLgY) with their trophy.  Would also love UCF "Best in the Country" shirts. 
Knational Khamps
The point is that it was close between Bama and Ohio State, and Bama was CLEARLY better. thats why they got in
Be careful not to cut yourself on that edge
Even in the college ranks I don't see how you can argue him over K, who built Duke into what it is today and sustained his success for over 30 years in a sport that makes it virtually impossible for elite teams to win many national titles in a short time frame. 
On one hand, I do find it odd that people think that if there's an omni-potent super being that it gives any flying fucks about a football game. If anything, worshipping games like we do would probably be false idolatry.On the other hand, he's a young man, he just made one of the greatest throws in history, and praising the lord does hint at some humility. 18 year old me wouldn't be humble at all. 
Your forgetting about multiple consecutive world series losses as well.
Only person I feel sorry for is Goggles. Dude is a fucking beast.
We have so much that we all take for granted. Life itself is a gift, even in suffering there's a promise that eternal life will wipe away all tears.
What about the spring games? Those are glimpses into football future 
With all due respect to the UCF program, which was absolutely brilliant this season and top 5 for me-there is NO way they win 4+ quarters against either of these teams. Love y'all but let's be reasonable.
Can you decline an offsides call?
It's crazy they never play during the regular season....what 2 times in the last 10 years?
It’s amazing, really. After all that all I could have said is “holy shit”
Pssh. These are B1G Refs--this is how we do. Get some other conference to ref if you want quality.

Huge part of the allure of the NFL...wait...
uGA handily beat Auburn in December. 
Moved to giant wall of text wrapping around head 
Richt had this same roster and was losing to Treon Harris UF teams lmao
[deleted]
Uhhh...nfl is football?
8 teams.  I think that's enough for any team that really has a chance to be involved.
This is slander. How dare you? 
But that also means you have to be in Texas...
They'll get over it when we do it again in 2050.
I know very little about football (and even less about college football - see my flair...) , but why would you replace him just because he played poorly for half of one game? Wasn't he the starter all season? 
I mean, y’all beat Auburn so UCF is my second favorite right now. I was mainly being shitty about congratulations being misspelled. 
This is unrelated but omnipotent isn't hyphenated. Idk why I thought this was even important enough to mention to be honest
Not just the psychological factor either. Those sustained drives kept the defense off the field and allowed them to rest up. 
This is embarrassing for you
Hey nah Let's have an average strength of schedule next year and not even go to the ACCCGWe'll get the 4th seed! 
I think he more than earned to opportunity to talk about whatever he wants for 2 seconds...
Wow man #75 proposed and his gal said yes.
Yeah that guy is awesome. He was on point all game for Georgia 
This is said after Auburn dominated both teams and was them dominated by UCF. UCF deserved a spot. 
"sometimes I give myself the creeps"Hilarious from the Alabama band
I would not call the majority of the second half domination by Georgia. 
He's no Legatron. 
Proposed with the Bama band playing Green Day in the background. Odd. Still sweet, I guess.
Is the band playing basketcase by green day?!
Really glad I'm only a Falcons fan. There really are some UGA fans I feel for tonight, which is not something I ever thought I'd say.
Props on that dude for immediately getting the picture of the lineman proposing. Looked like he didnt even know the guy and now they have a picture of a special moment forever. 
Not forgetting that. The Braves got wrecked this past season.
Thanks bro, it still hurts.
Exactly. The hilarity is what makes it the best. 
Probably dances around, points with both hands at groin...'cause I got HUGE BALLS, MA! THAT'S HOW I DO!
winning the national championship and getting laid? what's next? playing a really cool game and getting paid a million dollars for it?
Na dude, they are gonna destroy everyone on the way to the Superbowl. Then blow a huge lead to the AFC team, probably the Patriots.
Seriously, it was the first question they asked him too... 
I hate Alabama so much, but it's only because they win so much and I feel they are slightly overrated but I still respect them and saw this coming with a Nick Saban team down at halftime. Congrats Bama fans
I really really hate Bama,  but it’s hard to not like a guy like Tua.  He’s a great talent, and seems like a good kid.  He scares the shit out of me, but I’ll be looking forward to watch him play next year.
Who are you to say that? Any given sunday dude. Bama got into the playoffs without even winning their conference championship, I just think that's a travesty.
Atleast you got college football =/
eyyyyyyyy a proposal
Not only did Jesus will Alabama to victory, Jesus has also managed to get lots of brand new clothes to starving children in Africa!God is good!
Lol scott frost goes out there hulking up against Saban 
Haha, that is ridiculous. Here’s the link if anyone wants to see Flacco with wingshttps://www.google.com/amp/ftw.usatoday.com/2017/11/joe-flacco-espn-graphics-monday-night-football-raven-dancing-elite-ravens-texans-nfl/amp
It's like these football fans have never seen football before.  
They thought the zone look would trick the true freshman QB into forcing something over the middle. He ate that shit alive
Doesn’t god say the universe started about 6000 years ago? Science says that is blatantly false 
Lotta people got unhappy about the offsides that got called on our false start when they blocked the punt. Not that it really changed anything, but you know how game threads get, especially when there's a common enemy for 3rd-party fanbases.
Too true
The obvious ones are the uncalled facemask, and the offsides on the blocked punt.  I feel like there should have been an interception that was called incomplete.  I can't argue much with the call on that one though.
That guy has ice in his veins, incredible kicker. 
So does he even get to play next year? Does he transfer? What happens to the guy who got benched in the championship?
All the time!
somebody get that proposal replay
I never understood why atheists care so much. If there is nothing then who cares honestly if someone thinks otherwise. If believing in something not understood by you makes them happy is that not a good thing? I used to be one and now in later life am a hopeful agnostic.
Overrated?
Can't beat the other team and the refs too.
I think you need at least eight teams to have any sense of credibility in the system. You can still reward conference champions too. 5 power conference champions, one guaranteed spot from the Group of 5 (probably highest seed), and the next two highest seeded teams. Even that has problems. But, it's a lot better than what we have now.If you do that, this year you get Georgia, Oklahoma, UCF, Alabama, Clemson, USC, Ohio State, and Wisconsin. Seems much more fair to me.
Take it easy snowflake, you can't decide what's funny and what isn't. Just downvote and enjoy life like everyone else.
That's like the most popular song for college marching bands. 
Fuck the refs
A friend of mine did. One of them threw his nearly full beer against the wall. It made a pretty big dent. 
King Tom of house Brady atop the AFC East throne.
Eh, they're okay. Bear coached there.
Coach K is another one who I think has that claim as GOAT.But Saban won championships at two schools. He's built a ridiculiously good juggernaut that is in the conversation every single year and has been in every playoff. He has more NC's than Coach K despite having an overall shorter career as a HC. 
Again, if you're going to attribute Belichick's success to having the best QB then you must also attribute Saban's success to having the #1 recruiting class (by a pretty wide margin sometimes) in almost every year he's been at Alabama. Like if talent is the denominator here...Alabama has matched or out-talented every team in the FBS since 2008.
That's nonsense. If they deserved the win then they would have won it. 
Hate to break it to you.. but it definitely is
Always love the Million Dollar Band playing "Basket Case". Reminds me of when I was in the student section in 1998. Roll TiDE!!!Edit: left out the word "was"
It was and you should be, the did play well for a half and a quarter. It seems though when Najee Harris entered the game and he just started gouging the Bulldogs D time and time again exploiting so truly terrible tackling and Tua getting his confidence and rhythm going, it just felt like they couldn’t compete nor catch up. The offense went stagnant and the defense just couldn’t compete.
I think they'd balance each other out to form an average team. Not good but not noticably bad
Nah, they would've just poisoned his trees.
Love seeing that! Good stuff 
That's our usual song at the beginning of the 4th quarter. Not sure why they're playing it after the game is over
UCF is MY Champion
Because in this moment, they are euphoric. Not because of any phony god’s blessing. But because, they are enlightened by their intelligence.
Georgia keep your head up. You have a young, great coach in Kirby smart along with top recruiting classes. You will be back.
Okay, I'm serious this time. Goodnight! It's been a pleasure chatting with you, gentlemen.
It's kind of dicky to say when you think about it. You're saying that God used that DB who blew his coverage as a prop for you to win. 
A guy can’t praise who he worships after arguably the most important night of his life this far?! 
Oh man. I forgot that one. It’s like they gave a teenager a copy of Blender and said, “make us something cool”
Not even religious but that dude can come read me all four Gospels every Sunday if he keeps throwing passes like that. Not to mention he's like a 19 year old kid giving a painfully long interview on national TV after the biggest moment of his life...
My FSU-Bama shirt says "The Road to the Championship Begins Here" kill me
The Excalibur thing before the game was really bad. 
Not only that, but it was their first question too. Not even a "Congratulations! How does it feel to be a champion? So what went through your mind when..." 
Tua threw a dime. I kept saying give that kid a chance he'll surprise ya and look Bama listened and took hurts out and this entire game changed. Tua was the key to Bama's victory 
haha, it's cool tho. TIL. I often commit typos on Reddit, but I did actually think it was hyphenated so it's not a rando typo. 
No Bama played fucking great in the 2nd half. But that obvious face mask they missed could've changed things dramatically. First down for us, not a punt that turns to a touchdown for you, who knows? I'm largely just sad that we let this one go. But to say that obvious calls weren't missed would be inaccurate. 
That's what makes the Pats taking the east for 15 of the last 17 years not quite as bad. I can pretend to forget about it.
Someone salty cause their team forgot the game had a second half? lolol
And ladies!
So we all know Saban sold his soul to the devil, now Bama has Hawaiian Tebow throwing bombs for Jesus...how the fuck is Bama going to be stopped?! 
I'm glad you're able to find some joy still! Things'll get better, I promise!
Oh yeah. on weekends I've watched games for a bit then gone out to bars til they die down and get home and have a full quarter of shootout.
Fair point. 
Yes, why do you think they shouldn’t be there?
All the time, God is good! Although I think OP was being sarcastic. Not sure if you are being sarcastic as well. 
What a great season! I gotta say watching the rise of Milton and Tua from Hawaii is pretty surreal. Watching them destroy high schools to winning bowl games/national championships makes me so proud. #UFCHAWAII
Whats messed up is, those guys that can think that way have a mental advantage...its a false confidence that is more powerful than narcissism...and then it perpetuates the belief that jesus actually helps them...i played with a QB that literally said that it's not him out there playing, but Jesus playing thru him. 
But Tua had God on his side though
With a banged-up Kerryon Johnson. How did the game before that go? I can't recall.
I think he said "Lord and savior Jesus Christ" so I doubt it. 
Yeah there was some pretty bad calls missed by B1G officiating 
I'm neither an atheist nor trying to be edgy. Just pointing out it's only Christians who do what he did. No one thanks buddha, Allah or any other religious figure/deity and people just tacitly accept it as a norm.Guarantee you if someone wanted to thank Satan on national TV the coaching staff/university would put a stop to that. The question is: why?
Yeah we're used to our shitty referees lol
I don't care who anybody worships.  I have an issue invoking God in Football games.I don't like when people pray for their team to win, because both sides do it, then what?  To think God has any vested interest in the outcome of any football game is stupid.
To be close to their son. Especially since his younger brother committed to Bama too
Damn dude... that's depressing. Let the shitposts begin!
I feel so sorry for you.
Wow you showed them!
2017 Alabama tribe is still at war with the 2015 Oregon tribe
Dude chill you  fulpoty anus 
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=IJEGAdA4blQ
As Max Holloway would say,>it is what it is 
Recruiting classes are unknowns. Rankings are subjective. You know what you’re getting out of Brady every year. Plugging in a true freshman QB is like winning with a backup NFL QB. Belichick couldn’t do that the year Brady got hurt. Belichick also couldn’t win in Cleveland. 
Haha of course I'm kidding. Obviously all worth it, but just a bummer that they had to move from the paradise that is Hawaii down to Alabama of all places
How did Mekhi Brown not get ejected for that punch and he tried to punch his coach a few times? And holy moly that clothesline
As a Florida fan this made me laugh.
I just don't see them as number 1 year in year out. Top 5? Definitely. But I feel rating them as number 1 every year seems wrong
Gotta do better than win 2 games and then eat a bunch of cupcakes.
If only Hawaii could keep their talent in state . 
14 had a horrible night.  
I think after watching tonight and against Okl Ga looks awesome, but definitely beatable. They didn't put a full game into either...awesome 2nd half against Okl awesome 1st against Bama. I'm not saying ucf would win I'm just saying I didn't see enough to think they didn't have a chance, esp if you look at play against common opponents, i.e. Aub
Missed that one thankfully. 
He did say up there, not better than. Rose Bowl is practically untouchable. Bama's 1st half performance holds this one back from getting the title of best. I think the only Championships I've watched that could tie with VY-USC were the Bama/Clemson ones.
Nah I'll cut it off now thanks 
Of course!
Also Hawaii is an expensive place to live, has a family based culture, and he is a 5 star top rated qb.  Alabama has to be a great deal overall.
Kek wills it! 
Update?
That's a fine statement but the way our defense played in the second half it doesn't garuntee much changes. Other than a broken play we handled ourselves well in the second half. 
Now that is quite a statement you just made. 
Neither am I, and I’m sure as fuck not out here whining about someone’s personal views because my team lost. That’s embarrassing on them whether they can see it or not
It’s pretty ridiculous man. 
Yeah he had a real attitude problem this game. I hope the guy from Bama who collapsed on the sidelines is okay 
Jesus helps me fucking hate the huskies
They are praised for going undefeated, not their schedule. Saying that, GG folks! 
If he wins another Natty like Cam did, I’ll deliver the bag of moneyEDIT: but personally I like this kid Gatewood who just enrolled with Auburn
Holy shit. The production crew cuts a video out so fast. 
Everyone thinks their the protagonist of their own story
Anyone who is a Falcons and a UGA fan feels like they got 6 penises drawn on their face with a Sharpie.The only difference is that the Sharpie eventually washes off. This shit is in the history books now.
I don’t know, they’ve won 5 out of the last 9, hard to put anyone else in front of them.
It'll most likely end when Saban retires, unless they manage to hire someone like Dabo Swinney to replace him
Great game! Great year!
And that amazing technicolor rainbow in between.
I'm not convinced UCF dominated Auburn, or that Auburn dominated Alabama. Plus, the transitive property very obviously doesn't apply to football, especially in college. They may have deserved a spot, I'll grant you that. But directly compare UCF to UGA or BAMA in terms of coaching, talent, strength of schedule...it's quite literally a different league.
What did he say?
Again, you can't compare # of titles in cfb to cbb because cbb makes it impossible to win many national titles in a short period of time. Duke has had more top 10 rankings during K's tenure than anyone else; a short playoff like what CFB has would likely have given him several more titles.CFB on the other hand has historically been defined by dynasties - what Saban is doing now is arguably the most impressive thing ever seen in the sport but he didn't build Alabama like K built Duke. Put it this way - Saban would *never* be able to win 5 titles in 9 years if college football had a 16 or 32 team playoff. No one would, it's just impossible with that many teams. I think you are seriously underselling how hard it is to do what K did in cbb. The guy took over a solid-but-not-great CBB program and singlehandedly built it into the sport's gold standard. I just cannot see an argument for Saban over K when you consider the entirety of their careers and look beyond title counts.
Let’s be real, if he was invoking Allah that many times on national TV, there’d be quite a bit of outrage. The only reason so many people are okay with it is because it’s Jesus 
>Hawaiian Tebow throwing bombs for Jesus lmao
I think it's safe to assume it'l be Dabo. Every time hes asked he kinda just avoids it. 
You never put it together that people believe in a higher power for a boost of self confidence? Are you 5? Lol
ESPN should fire the guy doing these stupid 2004-era CGI graphics.
Good job giving the game away refs. Bullshit offsides on a blocked punt and crucial missed PI call.
Lol good point, and you're preaching to the choir there. I'm a Lions fan, and we just got to welcome the Browns to our prestigious club of 0-16
Why is it such an issue though? I don’t want to get into a religious discussion on r/CFB but even though I believe in God, I am not  naive enough to believe God grants every prayer, especially silly ones over a game.but that doesnt mean the guy cant praise his savior. 
it's not wrong but it's like saying god didn't love the other team as much as he loved his. you know there are christians on both sides
Because I think there is a season for a reason.
I had a camera shoved up my pee hole today, I imagine that's how tonight feels for them :( 
Lol look at their strength of record compared to UCF's. Compared to anyone else in the country. The talent on their roster. Their coach. Look at what they JUST DID. I mean are you serious??
Really everyone is saying Saban is the god now but that kid should have been playing since the 1st snap of their season. His talent so obviously trumps Jalen Hurts that it makes you think Saban can't recognize talent at all.
Transfer because he looks to be losing his spot
Whats Messed up is the fact that you find someone's religious beliefs messed up. I can guarantee "those people" are much happier than thou
One thought is to only let teams that win their division go to the playoffs. That way we wouldn't have to see two SEC teams play each other. Again.
Enough with the punt whining. The correct call would have been a false start and a dead ball. 
Asking the real questions
Cool we would be glad to. Make is easier for us to schedule enough good teams consistently.
I mean it was just a joke. No one said he can't worship Jesus 
He's actually right handed, just learned to throw the ball with his left hand
I was thinking the same thing, I was shocked he got put back in
dont worry, once you lose 2 or 3 national title games in the span of a couple years, you start to become dead inside. 
Great dude. He handled it just as well as anyone could. Really shitty of the reporter to just ambush him like that.
Maybe not this year but I only started watching football closely about 4 years ago so maybe I'm just tired of seeing Alabama at number 1 and want some disparity but on the other hand I do feel some other teams deserve number 1 at time rather than bama
[deleted]
Ummm Allah does get thanked by Muslims at a higher percentage than Christians thank Jesus when they are on TV. Mike Tyson literally did it and there was no backlash. And if a Satanist felt he drew power from Satan and won the national title, I am sure he would thank him. The problem is there hasn’t been a Satanist who has made it to that point for us to find out.I just don’t let an 18 year old kid thank his source of power effect me enough to comment on it though. You do you though boo boo!
Saving this shit, well played sir!
> You will be back to lose more championship games. 
Oof
Sorry, it's just something I feel particularly strong about after hearing a sermon on it as a kid.
They were losing at one point in the Saban era... definitely overrated
Not when Hawaii was in the game.
You're just handwaving at this point. Recruits are unknowns individually, but having the #1 class 80% of his tenure is not an "unknown", that is a quantifiable measure of talent. He obviously maximized that talent which is why we're even having this discussion, but to dismiss Belichick's incredible talent evaluation and development skills - the Patriots won their first two Super Bowls off the backs of great defenses, not Brady - is myopic.edit: also lol at using "not being able to win at Cleveland" as an argument against Belichick. Find me a coach who can. He actually is responsible for one of their two playoff appearances in the last couple decades so...
Butch Jones calls into Kirby’s headset and says “no way a freshman QB can throw it that far, don’t have safety help over top”
He either transfers or moves positions. He’s 25-2, gotta think there’s no shortage of programs that would love to have him as a starting QB. 
I'm salty because a block punt got called back for no reason that would have gave us the ball at the 15, a face mask got ignored that would have been a first down got ignored, a debatable uncatchable ball on a big third down got called on, and holding basically didn't exist all game. The last one applies to both teams. 
Shout out to Iowa for beating Ohio State but most importantly showing solidarity of the fan base by waving to the kids in the children's hospital. That is a awesome tradition. 
I'm in tears 
Not a false start; it's a dead ball penalty so they're supposed to blow the whistle immediately and stop play. I don't think offside is a dead ball penalty, but encroachment is.
yeah dude we get it we read your seven other salty-ass comments
[deleted]
Kirby Smart AKA Clark Kent Get your cold Dr. Pepper commercial Ad dude.
fuck, I missed it 
Yo dawg how many comments you gonna post complaining about the officiating?
It's the little things that kill teams. On the last play, Its cover 2.  UGA cb doesn't jam/reroute bamas wr and ugas safety is looking at the qbs eyes and doesn't play midpoint and let's wr behind. Hell of a game, mental mistakes are deadly. 
I'm saying up there is a huge stretch still. I also think the Bama Clemson games are overrated. I wrote a long comment about it, but I'm not particularly inclined to dredge it up.
Bruh . We just lost the super o  sos 
I know right!
I would love to see that. I honestly think y'all deserve it more than anyone. 0-12 to 13-0 in 2 years is fucking crazy.
You gonna put that salt on some fries?
He wasn’t offsides and it was a false start. Double fuck up.
Ooo or chiefs facts
Yeah you did :(
WHAT?! WHY?!
And that’s fine. I hope you’re not taking my comments as an attack against what you strongly believe in! I just feel like in times of joy, people of faith usually fall to their knees and pray to God first, which is what I felt Tua was doing!
Sucks to suck
No. it's a dead ball penalty.
I'm not saying they'd win either, but look at their performance against a common opponent. All 3 teams (Bama,Ga,UCF) played auburn. 2 of the 3 lost.  It's at least more than "eye test".
Good job to Georgia. Plenty of missed penalties, I’m not saying that the game wasn’t dirty and that the refs weren’t blind.Seriously, see you next year Kirby. Your team played great tonight. 
Forget the fireworks, she da real smokeshow
The refs fucked Georgia in that game.
And then when you point out something as true as what you just said, people attack you for it. Disagreeing with their belief system is offensive.
The refs fucked Georgia in that game.
Current St Louis QB (Chevan Cordeiro) committed to Hawaii I believe, which is exciting. 
They want others to be just as miserable as they are. 
Sure I'll give you that, but everything has to be considered. Man I wish we could just see them play but obviously and sadly that won't happen
Well...there are never college games on Sunday.
They beat Auburn, who beat Bama. Any given sunday.EDIT: Auburn lost to LSU who lost to Troy which beat Bama
Im really thankful oregon state will never make it so i wont have to experience your pain
I would love to see the shitstorm that would occur if someone opened their interview with "First off I just want to say allah 'akbar, before that last down I just kept repeating 'he'll catch this and we'll win insha'Allah'"Edit: I notice people keep downvoting OP above me yet offer no rebuttal. Good job reinforcing his point.
any word on Kyriq McDonald? What happened to him?
It's a football saying
Fuck those refs
I think that before the kicks
Eh, to each their own.  If a player wants to thank God for their given talent, that's totally cool and nice to see.I just don't like crediting God with the team win.
They played mediocre all seasonLost the game to the best team they played, had a month to heal up and game plan. We all know it was BS
Go Herd
No shit, I was being pedantic.
I agree. But momentum matters. And that face mask miss became a touchdown for you which led to a LOT of momentum. It's unfortunate but ultimately UGA just couldnt hold on and couldn't contain Tua. 
Messi hasn't retired yet, so there is still some hope. But once that happens, then yeah fuck sports. 
This sub needs a religion rule similar to the no politics one , encompassing atheism 
I doubt that’s how they look it at. They would rather go to another state where their 2 sons have a better opportunity for a better life. Besides Hawaii is expensive. They wouldn’t think twice about leaving imo. 
a fucking lot
LOL Auburn lost to LSU who lost to Troy. Troy national champs, any given sunday
They shoved a camera up zee weewee??
Thanks. I appreciate it 
Bruh, what is you doin? I mean dude, look at your self, I literally said "Coach K has an argument as GOAT" and you're accusing me of underselling his career. Wut?Saban has a near 90% win percentage at Alabama. He's basically winning NCs every other year. Alabama was in a pretty shit spot when he took over. As the recent plight of Florida, Michigan, and others show, reviving a fallen giant is no sure thing. 
Like anybody else wasn't doing it either, Bama's been hated on for being the patriots, NYY, and UCLA/Kentucky.
https://twitter.com/SweepTheLeg337/status/950523443421859840good night
Yes, we know.
[removed]
I'd say Bama still wins, but I just disagree with saying it is unreasonable to believe they'd have won it as well. Still a good year of football and Bama showed they're always a threat to win it all
I find organized religion messed up honestly. Organized religion has really turned me off from the concept of god in general 
That shit gave me chills
Honest question. What would your reaction be (particularly if you live in the Bible Belt and subscribe to that culture) if a player invoked the name of Allah, Vishnu, Satan, or whichever supernatural being is at the core of his beliefs?Full disclosure I have no problem with a player proclaiming his beliefs. Just saw the chatter in here regarding Tua and had to ask. 
No shit.
I'm just excited for what Tua brings to our offense, and excited for many more Bama - Georgia matchups 
Medical stuff, really unfun. -2/10 would not recommend 
Lol that logic 
yeah dude we get it we read your eight other salty-ass comments
Where Lennay at
I know we know
Not every location in Hawaii is paradise. But also a moderate home in Honolulu could get you a super nice house in Bama
I dont think we should go long stretches at #1, other teams should rotate, but I think on any given day, any of the teams in the top 4 can beat any of the other teams in the top 4. its just a representation of how they played on that day. if we turned around right now and wanted a rematch, Kirby might damn well blow us out who knows.
UCF is not the best team, they just had an easy schedule and ended up being better than an Auburn who had just taken a heavy loss to Georgia. I wanna see UCF try to beat Clemson or Oklahoma, let alone Alabama or Georgia
Booger looks very tired 
That's exactly where it went. Zee wee wee hurt
Good lord why do you athiest's just assume that there is no god whatsoever? Literally, There are things in this universe that we barely know about (Dark Matter, Black Holes, Edge of Universe) and yet God is guaranteed not possible for some reason. 
Yeah, Georgia got fucked by the refs
If I ever did put it together, I’m pretty sure I would have never posted that comment. Keep the rhetorical questions to yourself please 
Hawaiian Tebow. That made me laugh out loud.
I give thanks to Odin.
Aye!
I see. Comebacks and OT make the Rose Bowl great and the championship bad. A true freshman coming in after not staring a game and getting the offensive MVP does nothing for you? I doubt that would be the case were it any other team. 
As a pastor in the Bible Belt, it wouldn't rustle my jimmies. Other people believe other things, can't stop it. 
You're clearly forgetting the public outrage when Cassius Clay changed his name to Muhammed Ali.And when the Red Hot Chili Peppers thanked Satan for their 1992 VMA everyone flipped a shit.In any case, [this CNN piece](http://www.cnn.com/2010/LIVING/wayoflife/05/25/God.sports/index.html) states what I'm trying to convey but can't after so many beers 
Roll Tide! I can't believe it!
That's great but you really do not need to criticise others for it.
As a Muslim, I'd love it. I don't mind the religious interviews at all.regardless of the kids beliefs. 
For which team. As A bama fan I felt like they messed up a bunch of calls for us.
[deleted]
It wasn't cover 2. Pre-snap they disguised cover 2, but then the strong safety rolled down to the third reicever and they played cover 1. The CB played it really bad giving inside release and safety did a pretty bad job at weaving (he completely opened his hips). In overtime those mistakes are pretty common, being physically and mentally exhausted.
I hope someone can post a screenshot
Uh, Mormons worship Jesus.
As a neutral observer, I thought the refs were fine, but they really fucked up not calling Unsportsmanlike Conduct when the Bama player pushed the UGA QB in the head. I was floored it wasn't called.
That's golden coming from South fucking Carolina
You realize that didn't impact anything though right? It was a false start and a missed call, but it would've been a dead ball and they'd punt again. 
Bunch of bitter, hate-filled children who want to see the worst in religion while ignoring the good it does. 
"Oh not much"
But I don't think as a savior though right? 
I agree but he doesn’t mean any disrespect towards GA when referencing his dogma during the interview.  
Glad you didn’t use the best example, the Spurs. Would hate to have them mixed up with the Bama filth.
I want a Jewish QB to win one year and just start blabbering about Torah passages.
Herpes has nothing to do with fucking your family though. 
I don't agree with it either, but... If it helps people be good to each other and they're still open minded and accepting of others, then it's more a positive thing than a negative imo. People can either be awesome or shitty, whether they're religious or not.
I’ll have to agree with that. There was one play here a Uga defender grabbed #6 by the face mask though 
Why'd the tough guy's comment get deleted? I wanted to read the rest of it. A pretty shitty person calls them cancer kids. SMH. 
Down vote away.  Horribly missed facemask, the blocked punt, and another pass interference all have Alabama field position and points.
No one said there isn't a God. We're just saying [God probably isn't a sports fan](http://www.cnn.com/2010/LIVING/wayoflife/05/25/God.sports/index.html)
Their church is “The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints”They believe Jesus is the savior.
I'm saying you're underselling it because I think K is clearly better and has had a clearly better career. I'm saying that using title count is not a good way to compare coaches across different sports. Ever since the tournament expanded to 16+ teams it's been impossible to build a true dynasty in CBB. Let me put it this way: if K had the benefit of a shorter postseason (say 8 teams), where the only viable playoff-level talent played on P5 teams (as opposed to the huge number of mid-majors that can compete because talent is so spread out in the sport), where your #1 recruiting classes do not leave after a year but instead stay 3 years to back up your other #1 recruiting classes - well, fill in the blanks. How many titles do you think he'd have with a setup like that?What Saban has done is incredible. It does not make him the best coach ever of any sport and to say it does is *severely* underselling what coaches in other sports do. Frankly, there are very few things easier in the sports world than winning at a blueblood in cfb because *everything* is set up to benefit those top schools. And Saban has undeniably benefited from that in a way most top coaches in other sports don't.Which is why I don't think Saban, or really any cfb coach whose success came at established programs has a good claim to being the best coach in any sport. 
I forgot about that one too. By the way, was your kicker Papajohns usually this terrible?
I just realized something. Has Bama made it to the place where they don't pour the water cooler on the head coach?   I've long heard Bama doesn't rush the field...
Wouldn’t bother me! If you believe in something, I’m not going to try to silence your voice on it. 
i buy that
Serious question:Where might he transfer? Any other teams almost get him as a recruit?
A facemask out of bounds after first down run.  Yet they miss the facemask on a third down?  And fuck up a blocked punt?  Or another blatant pass interference on another third down?  
Seriously. I was rooting for UGA but I was hoping for a block or a make. I don't want anyone to have to deal with that.Edit: typo 
fixed my post, point remains the same
Can confirm.  Moved from Tuscaloosa to Honolulu so I felt the inverse effect.
From your own article Rich Franklin says “Win or lose, I always thank God for everything he has given me.” Remind me again why I should judge someone for thanking something they draw strength from. If you won the national title and thanked your all salad diet, I wouldn’t get upset enough to bitch about it online. Seems like a strange thing to get upset about. Now if he said “Jesus loves me more than my competitors and chose me to win over them” you might have a point. But they don’t, so you don’t. 
Missed it. What did they say?
You are right, but since this game happened in the south, I'll throw some Smokey and the Bandit knowledge at you with:>“When you tell somebody something, it depends on what part of the country you're standing in as to just how dumb you are.”Change the phrase, "part of the country" to "part of the world" , and it makes more sense.
In my **personal** experience, most hyper religious people Ive interacted with do not actually follow the teachings of open mindedness and acceptance of others. Not saying everyone is like that, but organized religion is NOT NECESSARY in order for someone to have morals and be a good human being. That comes from within. Meanwhile, history has shown that **organized** religion causes people to do terrible things to others who don’t prescribe to the same cult-like following 
So what you're proposing is athletes are allowed to thank Jesus as much as they like on national TV and anyone who doesn't want to see that isn't allowed to say anything? I'm gonna take a wild guess which side of the debate you're on.
51 days on the name.  Nice 
He's inconsistent.
I told my wife that as they played the "im not tired yet" song
But how many Champions of Life has he won

I'm not religious at all by go ahead and assume. I'm gonna take a wild guess and say you support NFL players kneeling during the national anthem. It's called the first amendment bruhTbh I'm just sick of the religion bashin for no reason, how does someone else's faith bother you so much?? Because it doesn't effect you at all
Crimson Tide's Championships are the only thing the state of Alabama produces for the rest of the country.
ALL of our kickers are that terrible. There's an agreement with all kickers to not go to Alabama.... /s  but honestly, we have had these kicker issues ever since Saban has been there
Saw him play in the Vanderbilt game. Knew he was the one.
WAIT A SECOND UCF IS USING THEIR MONEY IN THE BANK AND CHALLENGING BAMA TO A +1 NATTY GAME 
Yet this is literally being distributed worldwide via satellite.
I've washed it many times and will many times more. I've had it since my second year of school and I graduated December 2016.
Eh 
Yeah it was a great game here's to hopefully more matchups, either SEC championships or playoffs. Also we can all agree fuck Auburn amirite
This really is my main point.I'm all for a player thanking God for their individual talent.  I'm just firmly against crediting God for the win.
There was also one play where the Bama player got away with a face mask. Bama overall got the benefit of the calls in this one. There is no doubt about that outside of Alabama fans 
Saleem Abdul Rasheed thanked Allah already when he played at Alabama. 
*blames refs*Me:lol
Indeed mega fuck auburn. 
Fire him (them)? That's their future. Outsourcing. 
Fuck Clemson
You are a fucking idiot if you believe this.
Something something missle defense, something something NASA. 
I mean, sure.If you consider those to be things.
we'll happily take your bad kickers and they'll be given a hero's welcome
They didn’t have time to get the gatorade ready for it this time 
I'm not bashing religion and I'm not bothered by people's faith; I grew up in the Bible belt and was raised in a Christian household. But using your primetime national spotlight to thank Jesus instead of your teammates comes off as selfish and promoting your own personal religious agenda/beliefs. And are you suggesting NFL players kneeling goes against the first amendment? You lost me there. In any case, sure, the first amendment permits you to say what you like without government censorship. But it also permits me to disagree.Edit: remember kids, one of the cardinal rules of Reddit: when you have nothing good to say, downvote!
God, I hate to see Alabama win. But at least Alabama's been there before. Georgia fans would have been insufferable. I'm glad they get salty tears.
Let's not let this distract us from the fact Bama didn't even belong in the playoff to begin with, then the refs do everything to keep them in this game. Drown Tide!Delusional Tide fans down voting after being absent all game, lmao fucking shills.
Yea which will surely counteract the automatic down vote you get for possessing a Bama flair. 
I'm convincdd Bobby Cox made a deal with the devil to win the world series and this is the result. 
He’s usually much worse
Or maybe refs at that level could just make the calls when they're obvious as hell and right in front of them... 
Saw reports he missed media day due to being sick.
More accurate would be getting them off and blowing your load too early
can you please explain the difference between cover 2 and cover 1 (and cover 3)?^(thank you)
at first I thought he was taking a selfie
Be a Georgia sports team.
>yeah dude we get it we read your eight other salty-ass comments*nine
As an atheist, more power to the kid. I don't have to share his beliefs to respect his motivation.
That's, uh, not exactly what's being implied.
Eh, I’ll downvote you too
:)
wait what video are you referring to?
:)
It really didn’t come down to the refs 
I moved from Bama to Ohio 17 years ago. There's not much difference.
:)
Totally agree dude, hopefully we score some luck soon. We've all suffered alot maybe lady luck will approve soon
Where did i say i was an athiest... I dont believe in ghosts, and i dont think Jesus is wrapped up in football
People on SSRIs are probably "happier" than, but they still arent living in reality
Are we ever tolerable?
lol @ Georiga sports -Jesus Christ Our Savior
Felt similar all night every time Dawgs got to 3rd down. Third down? Now Bama's fucked.
Upvoted for effort
Not an expert but I've played a lot of NCAA14. Basically in a Cover 2 you have two safeties playing the deep part of the backfield and the corners and linebackers play more of a midfield zone. In Cover 3 you drop an extra corner back and have three DBs playing the deep field and the rest of the DBs/LBs play mid zone. Cover 1, you have man coverage on all CBs and LBs and one safety plays a mid zone and the other plays deep. The reason cover 1 was bad there is that there was only one safety patrolling the entire backfield, so if cheats too much to one side (which he did because he was following Tua's eyes) and the corner doesn't get good press on the outside receiver, it's an open deep ball. If that had actually been cover 2, there likely would have been a safety on Smith to contest that completion. Even still, it was an incredible job by Tua of looking off all his defenders and waiting until Smith had a chance to get open. Not to mention it was just a picture perfect throw. Just a thing of beauty.Edit: Actually after a second look there were definitely two safeties back, Kirby even said postgame it was cover 2. Makes it even more incredible that Tua looked them off that well and beat them with the throw.
I have to save this haha
It's really sad how much someone else's lifestyle, that doesn't effect you at all, bothers you so much.And no, I'm not religious, just beyond sick of this self-righteous anti-religion bullshit. It's exhausting. Get over it and live your own damn life.
Yeah the cb literally didn't even touch him. 
Whens the last time Texas was relevant, 2009?
You know it's bad when it comes from an Auburn fan.
Dude. You need to find something more productive to do with your time. You're not even thinking this through logically, you're ranting and I have no idea why. I'm trying to be polite and say "Yeah, Coach K has an argument" and you're throwing a fit because my views don't line up with yours. Grow up. Move on. Saban built up a down program, under sanctions I believe, into a juggernaut. There are inbuilt advantages at Alabama, but tons of other programs have the same or better advantages (ie UGA has much better local recruiting grounds) and yet no one has built a dynasty as dominate as Saban's.  What he has done in unprecedented in the modern era. If big programs are such a shoe in for winning NCs, howcome no one has built as dominating of a program as Saban? Why do Texas, Michigan, Florida, and other struggle for years on end? Why is it that the other two best coaches, Meyer and Dabo, have built programs that pale in comparison to Saban? Meyer has every advantage that Saban does. Florida collapsed just a few years after their NCs, showing how difficult it is to sustain a program. tOSU has been great every year under Meyer, but he still only has one NC there. Building such a consistent program is nearly impossible because you have to do so much. You have develop a hundred players instead of 15. You need about 50 of them to be on-field competitive, whereas in CBB you need 8 or so players. You have to prepare for injuries as being near inevitable, rather than freak occurences like in CBB. You have to evaluate and recruit dozens of players each year instead of 3 or 4. The whole CFB season is nearly a playoff. One bad game at any point in the season and you risk being eliminated. Two bad games, you're almost certainly done. It's time for you to act mature. People are allowed to have different opinions than your own. There are lots of complex arguments and factors, you don't get gloss over them because they inconvenience your world view. If building up a program like Saban did was possible, others would be building comparable program. But no one has come close. There are people nipping at Coach K's heels. Roy Williams isn't that far behind. Knight's record in the 70s and 80s was very comparable. He tapered off in the 90's but wasn't that far behind. 
It sucks people let their beliefs spill over into other discussions, but it's mostly just the young crowd who are still ra-ra about their convictions, and think it's prudent to take every platform they can to voice them.
Poor guy probably had the flu. I know it's going around big time in the south right now
I just really love my state, glad you guys won. I hate Georgia 
Don’t hurt me! Your salt pleases me! It all started with you! Hook em horns
The state of lane kiffins best line ever? Want to go to South Carolina and end up pumping gas for a living?
That was so great!!!
THEY were insufferable in the game.
I hear ya bud. I think we're on the same page. :)
You will try
We had one of the top kickers recruited last year but he went to ASU because that's where his girlfriend went. 
There are multiple types of cover 2, cover 3, and cover 1 (even if this one it's the most straightforward).Those are different coverage concept, mainly for the secondary (however, they are chosen considering the overall defensive call. If you want to blitz, usually a cover 1 or cover 0 is the best fit).Cover 1 is a defensive coverage where there is one high safety that generally cover the middle of the field (hash to hash) while all the other DBs are in man coverage. Usually CB are in man on #1 (The first receiver counting from outside to inside), while the other Safeties/Nickel/ect are on #2-#3. The high safety (which generally is the Free Safety) has the responsibility to cover the middle of the field, to read the QB and THEN helps CBs with their man coverages. Basically it's really impossible cover the whole width of the field, so for a safety to cover a deep route on the sideline on the #1 it requires good film studies and perfect QB read, otherwise there is no way he can reach the receiver in time (considering a good QB).Cover 2 is a defensive coverage where there are two high safeties. There are multiple cover 2 schemes, but the basic is that the two safeties divide the field in two halves, and they let nobody go over them. GENERALLY, the CB is the flat player. Instead to cover deep, he let the safety cover the deep route and jump on everything flat. However, this is really made simple because in a case of double vertical, you have to cover deep sideline because the safeties will not be able to cover both deep routes. In cover 2, most of time you want the CB have OUTSIDE leverage on the reicever, so he can reroute him inside, making the job of the safety easier (if he would let the receiver go outside him, to the sideline, it will be harder for the safety to cover him).Linebackers responsibilities change based on the formation and blitzes, but overall you usually have 1 or 2 linebackers that take care of the hook areas (the area between the flat and the middle of the field).In cover 3, you have three high "safeties". I typed "safeties" because you don't literally have three safeties in the field that cover deep, but three players that can be one safety and two CBs; two safeties and one CB; and so on.Basically those three players split the field in three parts. Probably cover 2 is the one with the most different applications.Let's take the example of Cover 3 Sky: in this coverage, the free safety has the 1/3 middle field, and both cornerbacks drop and cover the others 1/3 of the field. At the same time, strong safety rolls down and cover the flat (which one cornerback leaves because he is going deep) and one linebacker leaves the box and go cover the other flat (that also the other cornerback leaves because he is going deep 1/3).Every coverage has his pros and cons. Some of them are better against heavy passing offense, some of them are better with a certain kind of personnel (for example if you have good DB personnel that are aggressive and can play man, cover 1 or 0 can be really good and let you make different blitzes upfront with your D-Line / Linebackers).
Why? That 80 yard TD pass could have easily been called OB for Georgia.
What about the 80 yard TD that could have easily been called OB for Georgia?
He did thank and give credit to his teammates so it seems like kind of a non-issue. I can't find the clip at the moment, but I thought it was the same interviewer.
You obviously didn watch the UCF auburn game orbthe iron bowl. Both had one team completely dominate the other. Obviously transitive property doesn't work and obviously on paper UCF would lose, but on paper UCF shoukdnt have even been in the game against AU, shouldn't have gone undefeated. UCF was special and would have competed with any team in the country. Hell by your argument of on paper, the game shouldn't even be played
>  thank Jesus instead of your teammatesHe thanked his teammates profusely as well. He even went position by position, lol.
So I guess everyone realizes including Bama in the playoffs was a good idea now?
DABO HOT SEAT CONFIRMED
Easily? Play was reviewed and stood yet you say easily? 
No?
You right
You're right, and he handled the entire interview very well considering how young he is with such a huge spotlight on him. In this case he absolutely thanked his team, but there are frequently situations where that isn't the case and those are more what I was referring to. Tua's interview just sparked what's turned into a messy impromptu discussion.
[deleted]
The trophy really is dumb looking. 
Man that was just fucked up how they did Jalen.
It was actually Cover 4 disguised as Cover 2. Which confused Tua, the freshman. And had UGA ran it correctly it could’ve ended the game.BUT, the safety, a veteran with like 40 starts, either doesn’t know the play or didn’t get the call. He played middle third, which would’ve made him think they were in Cover 3. [link to play full view](https://twitter.com/coachescollab/status/950597908214243328) Look at the right side of UGA’s defense. How it flows back and that half is umbrella’d. UGAs left corner plays cover 4 as well, which is why he let the WR free, although he is wrong for not re-routing him. The last part of that Cover 4 is the veteran safety. He played middle third instead of half. Game over on that one mistake. Hope this helps anybody else asking what happened. Sorry UGA bros. 
Texas A&M was looking at him first as he's from Houston 
It's true 
Yea there's no god. 
I believe he was implying that if the refs were dirty that would have been an easy call to flip. 
[deleted]
Right. It stood, it was not confirmed. So had it been called OB on the field, it would have likely stood after replay as well. So yes, easily.Edit: How can you not say that [this](https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Tght1hginjHiYHQOJaOK6LJXtYo=/1200x0/filters:no_upscale\(\)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10000705/20180108214436.jpg) is a tossup?
True true
Kind of a weak definition of domination when it was tied in the 4th quarter
Genuinely curious: why try to poach the other teams' players?  Why not focus on free agents and developing the youth team?

I agree 100%. But like what's our kicking coaches Twitter let's point people there 
If the other team is playing for the Browns year in and year out and you know theyll never win, and you are the Patriots year in and year out, you don't want to see them continuously be the ones that fail at the end of the season. You want them to be a part of the winning team. Especially knowing they will be able to contribute cause you have the GOAT owner, coach, and qb! 
It can take over if your not careful lol
Selfish for thanking Jesus.....I suppose you dont truly understand the Christian faith 
Is okay baby :)
But those players have already chosen the Browns.  If the point is to increase your roster, why waste time trying to recruit players that already play on the other teams when you could use that time/energy to get uncomitted players?    Furthermore, the outcome of the season isn't certain.  So how could you say someone playing for The Browns or The Redskins is on the wrong team?
Step 1: Be GeorgiaStep 2: Don't not be GeorgiaStep 3: Blow CoverageStep 4: ????Step 5: Georgia is kill
I think the Southern Poverty Law Center branded it a hate song or something. It's been banned a few years now
Exactly, I can believe it. But in college I've also resigned to the fact that Nevada will never win a Natty in football, their only chance came in 90 against Georgia Southern as a 1-AA. And they'll definitely never win one now. Never in baseball, and incredibly unlikely in basketball.So I have pro sports, and luckily the Denver Broncos have one too. But watching your hometown college you're currently enrolled in and gonna graduate from do it? Man, that'd be a sick feeling. I've been spoiled with the baseball titles, I'll admit that.
Jalen is pure class. Kid wants his team to win. He's still an all-time great, IMO. Incredible starting record, whether you want to credit him with it or not.
Still hasn't stopped him from winning titles.
[removed]
Because you still want those players. They all contribute their team and so you still want them for your team. Plenty of people on the team and f.o. to help recruit so recruit everybody. Furthermore, they play in a rigged system in which the nfl commish knows exactly whose going to win and by how much. The season gets played and everyone plays but only the Patriots win in the end. Part of that occurs though because the other teams just arent good enough. (Lots of important ideas and understanding gets lost in this translation lol) 
Go herd!
Well, I'm retired from the game in any case.  I claim no affiliation, I just want to keep the teams from getting subsidies to build stadiums.  They get enough revenue from TV and merchandise and season ticket holders. 
Ha. 
Can I bring you to Vegas? I'll bet on anything you bet against. 
Last laugh
Tua winning the game. Name a better fuck you to /r/CFB. 
Hahahahahahahahaha saving this
You wouldn't say that if they were bad. I'll take the high praise. Fuck Sparty. Roll damn Tide. Go Big Blue. 
You watched the birth of a legend tonight. 
I jus wanted to let you know that your comment on the residents evil gatekeeping post made me laugh 
Would you say that Tua and Milton...did the damn ting?
Nah, we won the game
The fuck
Did you know, if he took viagra, he could play baseball without a bat
Respectfully, pastor, you misunderstood what I meant. Re-read my comment and replace "Jesus" with "pilates" or "skee-ball" or something else that in all likelihood did not contribute to the team's victory as much as the teamwork that happened on that field. I do not disagree with anyone thanking whichever higher power they believe in, just the idea that whichever higher power is the sole reason victory was attained. *That* rubs me the wrong way.Many users have correctly reminded me that Tua didn't specifically thank Jesus for a victory and spent time acknowledging his teammates who made victory possible. I think he handled the interview extremely well for how young he is while in such an enormous spotlight. His statement just sparked a conversation that got a little messy because /r/cfb isn't really the correct place to have said conversation.
I mean, someone has to be the pavement
I guess I can respect this, I would probably cheer for GT over Auburn. Not because of state pride though, just because Fuck Auburn
Smart said it was cover 2 post-game...
It was cover 2... Tau looked the safety off down the middle and fooled him because the safety was reading the QB's eyes, which is why the safety was late to the ball. You can see the CB getting mad at the safety because it was the safety who had the deep wr.Also Smart said postgame it was cover 2
It's really down to this... They hate bama and whatever theism we may or may not take. 
flair 
Cr1tikal did a YouTube on that procedure.  I've had catheters, uncomfortable but the camera sounds terrifying. 
Unfortunately, they dont have a "*C+*" upvote. 
*shhhh shh. Hide your head child. Stow away in victory.*
Everyone  is going to meltdown when he replaces Saban at retirement. 
I mean he sure as fuck seems to hate Tennessee 
Gulf Coast Bama here: throw ball to man who catch ball. Win.Praise your big guy who makes your physics and beats others. Profit. 
He's going to have such a shit time...I accept him already. It's going to be great!
I think refs missed a clear FM and unnecessary roughness on Bama, so they gave benifit on this call.Even without knowing how it ended, I thought it was a fair trade off at the time. 
Sounds so bama. Shit luck with our kickers. 
As is a decade long tradition... 
I figured flu or since he's young, maybe a panic attack. Couldn't blame him for either. 
We'll absolutely see them again!*...... after we both beat (or don't) those auburn farmers again. 
Fancy words for *"he fucked it up"*. 
They were undefeated this season. They had an easy regular season schedule but they beat Auburn in their bowl game, the same Auburn that beat Bama.Basically college football playoffs are broken, an undefeated team should get the chance to win it all.
Glitch in the salt matrix. 
I’m on the Bandwagon?
I haven't flaired up. I'm a GA fan. Still doesn't change the fact that they shouldn't have been in the playoffs. 
That poor shit
[Since this let down, I feverishly await an update. ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClwnsE_Kkw4)
FML 
*teehee hee* then.That was one of the best CFB games I've ever watched*. *(outside the dreaded kick 6)
It was a great game. But that doesn't change the fact that Bama didn't earn their way there.
Let me see, the false start on the punt block, how the hell do you call offsides there.  That guy is keyed on the dude that moved early.   The face mask on Swift (I still do not see how the ref missed it), both of the within 5 minutes of the half.  I think those penalties and the crazy Matt Ryan type, helmet interception were what swung the momentum around for Bama.  Plus, Bama CBs were all over UGA WRs all the time, yet they call a PI on an uncatchable way out of bounds, wtf.
If it was the nfl they would have called a screen and tried to get back in fg range I feel
They signed the #1 kicker last year. Was a GT commit for several months until Saban came calling.
I'm glad they finally listened to /u/md90_. Your championship ring and thank you card from Saban should be in the mail. 
The recap of the NCAA season that ended in highlights from the game and Bama accepting the trophy. They chopped together a good looking video with the quick. 
Ohio State set the precedent for what Bama did a few years back, but even if you think they didn't earn their way there, can you deny they were one of the best four teams?
Sorry, meant MLB. Was late af
I'm sure Alabama fans were perfect
I've noticed a lot of Auburn folks pulled for us.  At least it's kind of the status quo, whereas if Georgia won you'd have to deal with BS from both.  Felt the same about y'all in 2010 and 2013.  At one point there were 5 year old kids who had never been alive in a time when a team from Alabama wasn't national champion.
Pls.
What a waste
Yeah, people are forgetting that.
I can think of quite a few.
The punt would not be blocked if they got the call correct it would have been a false start and we would punt again. How do people not understand that?
Officiating was awfully one-sided. But there is a reason you never leave it to the refs. 
They will lose.
The missed defensive holding was game ending. It would've given Ohio State a first down with less than two minutes left and Miami without a way to stop the clock. If that flag gets thrown OSU gets three kneel downs and the game is over. Without the block in the back, Miami has almost no time to move way down the field for the tying field goal. The flag being really late has no bearing on anything. The infraction was committed before the ball got there, in the form of defensive holding. It's not about what happened when the ball arrived. Keith Jackson even calls it out in the broadcast.

I agree, the only way I saw the penalty could be upheld was him rushing and stopping causing the line to flinch. 
The false start would've resulted in Bama punting again - Georgia wouldn't keep the punt block. So it was super minor. The refs should've called the facemask but since the tackler's hand dropped to Swift's collar mid-tackle, I can see why they missed it in real time 
PLS NO

Well it's not wrong.
Yeah why not
When that happened I cringed. I was absolutely sure the flag was getting thrown.
It's part of the deal that we collectively made with the devil. Our coaching and our players will always be good enough for a title run, but our kickers will consistently be some of the worst in the country. So far it's worked out nicely but our special teams have cost us several huge games under Saban.
I'd so much rather have just Bama bragging all year than have both teams have their egos inflated 
And y'all still beat us.
That's why I cheered for Bama. I mean, ga hadn't done much and they were already "this is dynasty" mode earlier in the season. Think what it would be like if they won. It's like they are waiting to become the sports poor winners. 
It's ok until it hits the bladder area, then it's pretty awful
Maybe they should.......humble themselves. 
its certainly a roller coaster of emotions.

This is a vey strange response. 3 sentences should not be considered long to anyone with the mental fortitude above a 6 year old. 
For real tho
Shoulda been UCF 
Nah. If anything this sort of just shows that you can't recognize talent at all.
do you really believe that Auburn team in the Peach Bowl was playing with the same desire and focus as the one that played when there was really something on the line? Let UCF play Bama and UGA 3 times in the course of 6 weeks and then show up to play a bowl game and show me what they have in the tank. Got a kid at UCF and they did great but one game does not make a season.
Join a P5 conference and it becomes much easier. I am sure if your AD called the big 12 that they would love to have a team in Florida.
Are you serious? lol
dude you sound like sports center, "we're just going to completely ignore the fact that penalties play any role in football and praise this kid who threw one td to a guy he wasnt aiming for and then another to a wr who was 10 yards away from the nearest defender." 
well i guess if they did it before the game it would have ruined the surprise. but maybe some flowers and a nice dinner before the team flies home would suffice. 
Pretty much
Didn’t see the presser. This means everybody knew the play except the safety. If you watch before the snap he’s yelling something—either doesn’t know the play or didn’t get the call. He went straight back to play middle responsibility which means he thought it was Cover 3. Sad
Mercedes Benz, Honda, Hyundai, Airbus
Bama has *never once* rushed the field
I had a camera shoved up my pee hole today, I imagine that's how tonight feels for them :(
I don't live in the bible belt but i have absolutely zero problem with it (might side eye the satan one) but if they are muslim or hindu or any other religion and want to give thanks its all good. You shouldn't hate someone purely because of something like that which you disagree on just my opinion
hah, that shit's been stamped, man
When I posted that I forgot all about the 1Q miss. Damn it wouldn't even have come down to the end of regulation if he hit that 1Q
The safety knew it was cover 2 and so did Tua. The safety tried to mask his coverage and fool Tua but Tua wasnt fooled (he talked about it postgame.) Tua knew the safety was going to read his eyes which is why Tua looked off at the middle of the field which froze the safety a bit and caused him to be late to the play. Also it hwlps that the WR ran the perfect rout against a cover 2, Deep streak down the sideline 
Still odd. Corner let the WR go free release. Safety, even if he was reading Tua’s eyes, never even took a step over the top which is his responsibility. He went straight to play middle. Still heartbreaking 
Yea Corner fucked up by not jamming the WR, but even if the corner jammed the wr i think the pass still gets completed because the safety was slow to react. I bet if they ran that play again the defensive coordinator would have called cover 3, or man coverage with safety help.
My brother is in the Red Coats (Georgia’s Marching band), and they started a thing where everything he goes to kick they yell “ALLL ABBBOOOOAAARRRDD THE BLAAANKEEENSHHIIIPPP!!!” He’s the favorite player on campus, slightly above Fromm.Edit: every time, not everything.
It's fine, everything fine, this will help both of my teams long term. We'll be fine... 
Imagine if they lost on another missed fg
And you sound like a typical fan of the losing team, myteam did literally nothing to lose the game it was all the refs and the other team cheating. 
Teams can dominate 85% of a game and still lose, as evidenced by last night. The score was close in both games. Anyways, I'm definitely in agreement that paper shouldn't decide everything, and we'll have to agree to disagree on our evaluation of each team. Fucking really wish we could see them play.
Lol your schedule is just bad. Enjoy the banner, we'll take the trophy home.
SOME people said that about Auburn. Many said Auburn didn't want to be there and wouldn't be motivated.
you're right. and my team did plenty to lose the game at the end, the offensive play calling looked like it was being run by a 4 year old madden player and i still am not quite sure how someone gets that open on 2nd and 20 something in ot of the national championship but i feel like the fact that there were so many glaringly bad calls that so obviously played a massive part in the outcome shouldnt just be ignored.
So the missed head press in the ground was big and was highlighted because #48s antics but without that it isn't called 100% of the time. How many times did we see both teams being choppy and pushing and shoving and talking trash? The punch should've ejected a strictly special teams player and we had a missed face mask that I honestly missed until slow motion, it looked like he got the inside collar. 1 missed call on a non reviewable play, 1 non ejection, and 1 play that is questionable and subjective to the ref. At the end of the day, these were referees from another conference that allowed most of the extra antics to fly, except an egregious punch to the face. If you want to be technical the big hit on devonte smith by your number 11(I think?) was targeting he literally lead with the top of his helmet and should be penalized for player safety. It is what it is and you don't allow the refs to control the game, if you're begging for 15 yard penalties to keep you in the game then you need to blame your own team. You can play the ifs and buts game all day but at the end of the day you were outscored 23-10 in the second half, and allowed a guy to run wide open in OT. You can't blame anyone but your own team.
how about that false start on the touchdown that tied the game, how about that "offside" on the blocked punt that blatantly wasnt even offsides, you're saying that in a championship game i should be able to list 5 or 6 different occurrences and not be mad about it? but hey that dude was a freshman right, yea he was a freshman and a true freshman at that, and there were 14 other freshman on the field so i should just forget about it.Edit: the thing is alabama is gonna be there every year. you guys can not even make the sec final and still get in without even being questioned so i wouldnt expect you to understand the frustration of being a fan who actually has to win everything and still hope to get selected at the end of the year.
I'm not one of those Auburn fans that settles for winning the iron bowl, it means nothing since you guys won the natty. I'd much rather have that 
Looked like the CB was expecting backside help from the safety 
They don't need to play them 6 times....just once. I'm just saying it is not impossible. Bama likely woulda won (tho prob not without that genious qb switch), but it's nothing to scoff at 
Did you still this comment or just coincidence?[https://reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/7p4twp/_/dselkhh/?context=1](https://reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/7p4twp/_/dselkhh/?context=1)
I'm OK with that. 
they should call you the virginizer
He kinda did get away with it tho? They still won. 
He's welcome in Gainesville. 
Lol surely not but it was amplified because there were so few of us, and we were surrounded by Georgia fans berating us. Idk why you’d be so confident against Bama.
Agreed, and there would be nothing wrong with a player who's a Satanist giving thanks to Satan if that is the ideology to which he subscribes. 
First and foremost I don't even know who I'm taking about because you're not flaired. The offsides is a fine complaint but in terms of turnovers it doesn't change anything. I don't recall the false start but I'll say that it should've been called. What I'm saying is, Georgia had 142 yards in the second half, including an 80 yard touchdown. Again you can't blame that performance on the refs. 
You're right-- 2008, 2015, and the next game will be at BDS in 2020. The 14 team conference scheduling doesn't do us many favors. This year's freshman class will never play Florida in the regular season.
I think it’s some kind of bot account actually 
99.9% agree. We didn't look the same the second half at all really. And the negation of the blocked kick took some wind out of our sails. 
What?! Go Herd Roll Tide!
\>calls me immature, tells me I'm ranting and need to find a better use of my time even though all I did was argue your opinion and not attack you as a person\>proceeds to post a response double the length of mine while personally attacking meok.jpg
Even bots hate bama. 
yes, It is the most logical move for UCF to grow their program and for the Big 12 to expand their television market and recruiting base. If you want to run with the big dogs you have to get off the porch more than just once per year. If they play OU, Texas, TT, Oklahoma State, TCU etc and come out undefeated or win the conference they would be in the playoff. Would playing that schedule worry you?
Yeah but it's not up to us to move to the Big 12 and they said they don't want us.https://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/7nxkud/big_12_commissioner_bob_bowlsby_isnt_ready_for/
he said he didn't want to expand the playoffs beyond 4 teams. he didn't say squat about not wanting to expand the big 12 into one of the biggest recruiting and tv markets out there
You need help with socialization dude. No joke. Two or three different times you kept trying to engage me and I was saying "hey, we have a difference of opinion, I respect your opinion."grow up. 
I don't think Jesus is wrapped in it either, but it doesn't mean you can't ask for it.
Plenty more, including them, just didn't want to list them all. 
Noice b8 m8.
Why are you guys even suggesting that God would care about sports like that? He would care more about the players who are asking him to keep everyone safe and play their best than the game itself. 
Yes. I, the person who kept the discussion strictly sports-related, need help while you, the person who resorted to attacks on my character and interpreted my disagreeing with your opinion as a personal attack, are the "mature" one. The irony is that it's you who's having trouble accepting a difference in opinion. News flash: if you express an opinion on the internet, it's okay for other people to argue that opinion. I wasn't being rude to you, but you for whatever reason got offended that anyone would dare to argue with you. By all means continue to believe you're the "adult" in this conversation, though.
LOL
Late to the reply but still wanted to respond. I think my biggest gripe is that you had Ohio State (who won it's conference and division) left out for a team that by their record won no title to get them into the playoffs. The only way to go is to have 8 teams. 
It wasn’t cover 2. The fact that Tau was able to move the safety to the right proves that they had only one high safety reading QB eyes. Something that doesn’t happen in cover 1.They started in cover 2 and then post snap the second safety went down to trips side to play man on #3 , changing the coverage in cover1.Plus, if you are not convinced, this is the LITERAL quote from the QB himself in postgame conference.“They tried to disguise their Cover Two. And when I dropped back, I looked at their middle safety down, I mean the Cover Two safety, inside on the third receiver coming over and I just went back outside and Smitty was open so I took the shot and here we are now."

"They tried to disguise their Cover 2" ....Bro that means they are in cover 2 lmao you played yourself"And when i looked at their middle safety I MEAN COVER 2 SAFETY"....that also means they are in cover 2 because they have a cover 2 safety
Didn’t do it, was too tired.
